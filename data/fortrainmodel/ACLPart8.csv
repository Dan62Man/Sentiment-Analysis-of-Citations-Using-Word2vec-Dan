E06-1019.txt,211,The error rates for the three dependency based methods are similar no one method provides much more guidance than the other.
E06-1019.txt,212,Enforcing head constraints produces only a small improvement over the D ITG.
E06-1019.txt,213,Assuming our beam search is approximating a complete search_comma_ these results also indicate that D ITG space and dependency space have very similar properties with respect to alignment.
E06-1019.txt,214,4.4 Oracle objective function Anytime welimit an alignment space_comma_ werisk ruling out correct alignments.
E06-1019.txt,215,We now test the expressiveness of an alignment space according to the best alignments that can be found there when given an oracle link score.
E06-1019.txt,216,This is similar to the experiments in Fox_comma_ 2002 _comma_ but instead of countingcrossings_comma_ wecount howmanylinksamaximal alignment misses when confined to the space.
E06-1019.txt,217,We create a tailored flink for each sentence pair_comma_ based on the gold standard alignment for that pair.
E06-1019.txt,218,Gold standard links are broken up into twocategories in Och and Ney s evaluation framework 2003 .
E06-1019.txt,219,S links are used when the annotators agree and are certain_comma_ while P links are meant to handle ambiguity.
E06-1019.txt,220,Since only S links are used to calculate recall_comma_ we define our flink to mirror the S links in the gold standard flink a_comma_E_comma_F   1 if a is an S in E_comma_F 0 if a is a link to null 1 otherwise Table 2 shows the results of maximizing summed flink values in our various alignment spaces.
E06-1019.txt,221,The two imperfect permutation searches were left out_comma_ as they are simply approximating maximum matching.
E06-1019.txt,222,The precision column was left out_comma_ as it is trivially 100 in all cases.
E06-1019.txt,223,A new column has been added to count missed links.
E06-1019.txt,224,Maximum matching sets the upper bound for this task_comma_ with a recall of 96.4.
E06-1019.txt,225,It does not achieve perfect recall due to the one to one constraint.
E06-1019.txt,226,Note that its error rate is not a lower bound on the AER of a one to one aligner_comma_ as systems can score better by including P links.
E06-1019.txt,227,Of the constrained systems_comma_ ITG fairs the best_comma_ showing only a tiny reduction in recall_comma_ due to 3 missed links throughout the entire test set.
E06-1019.txt,228,Considering the non trivial amount of guidance provided by the ITG in Section 4.3_comma_ this small drop in 151 Table 2 Results with the perfect link score.
E06-1019.txt,229,Method Rec Missed F AER Dep 94.1 260 97.0 3.02 HD ITG 94.2 258 97.0 3.00 D ITG 94.8 232 97.3 2.69 ITG 96.3 165 98.1 1.90 Match 96.4 162 98.1 1.86 expressiveness is quite impressive.
E06-1019.txt,230,For the most part_comma_ the ITG constraints appear to rule out only incorrect alignments.
E06-1019.txt,231,The D ITG has the next highest recall_comma_ doing noticeably better than the two other dependencybased searches_comma_ but worse than the ITG.
E06-1019.txt,232,The 1.5 drop in expressiveness may or may not be worth the increased guidance shown in Section 4.3_comma_ depending on the task.
E06-1019.txt,233,It may be surprising to see DITG outperforming Dep_comma_ as the alignment space of Dep is larger than that of D ITG.
E06-1019.txt,234,The heuristic nature of Dep s search means that its alignment space is only partially explored.
E06-1019.txt,235,The HD ITG makes 26 fewer correct links than the D ITG_comma_ each corresponding to a single missed link in a different sentence pair.
E06-1019.txt,236,These misses occur in cases where two modifiers switch position with respect to their head during translation.
E06-1019.txt,237,Surprisingly_comma_ there are regularly occurring_comma_ systematic constructs that violate the head constraints.
E06-1019.txt,238,Anexample of such a construct is when an English noun has both adjective and noun modifiers.
E06-1019.txt,239,Cases like Canadian WheatBoard aretranslated as_comma_ Board Canadian of Wheat _comma_ switching the modifiers relative positions.
E06-1019.txt,240,These switches correspond to discontinuous constituents Melamed_comma_ 2003 in general bitext parsing.
E06-1019.txt,241,The D ITGcan handle discontinuities by freely grouping constituents to create continuity_comma_ but the HD ITG_comma_ with its fixed head and modifiers_comma_ cannot.
E06-1019.txt,242,Given that the HD ITG provides only slightly more guidance than the DITG_comma_ we recommend that this type of head information be included only as a soft constraint.
E06-1019.txt,243,5 Conclusion We have presented two new alignment spaces based on adependency treeprovided forone ofthe sentences in a sentence pair.
E06-1019.txt,244,We have given grammars to conduct a perfect search of these spaces using an ITG parser.
E06-1019.txt,245,The grammars derive exactly one structure for each alignment.
E06-1019.txt,246,We have shown that syntactic constraints alone can have a very positive effect on alignment error rate.
E06-1019.txt,247,With a learned objective function_comma_ ITG constraints reduce maximum matching s error rate by 10 _comma_ while D ITG constraints produce a 31 reduction.
E06-1019.txt,248,This gap in error rate demonstrates that a dependency tree over the English sentence can be a very powerful tool when making alignment decisions.
E06-1019.txt,249,We have also shown that while dependency constraints might limit alignment expressiveness too much for some tasks_comma_ enforcing ITG constraints results in almost no reduction in achievable recall. .
E06-2014.txt,1,problem we address in this paper is that of providing contextual examples of translation equivalents for words from the general lexicon using comparable corpora and semantic annotation that is uniform for the source and target languages. For a sentence_comma_ phrase or a query expression in the source language the tool detects the semantictypeofthesituationinquestionand gives examples of similar contexts from the target language corpus.
E06-2014.txt,3,It is widely acknowledged that human translators can benefit from a wide range of applications in computational linguistics_comma_ including Machine Translation Carl and Way_comma_ 2003 _comma_ Translation Memory Planas and Furuse_comma_ 2000 _comma_ etc. There have been recent research on tools detecting translation equivalents for technical vocabulary in a restricted domain_comma_ e.g.
E06-2014.txt,4,Dagan and Church_comma_ 1997 Bennison and Bowker_comma_ 2000 .
E06-2014.txt,5,The methodology in this case is based on extraction of terminology both single and multiword units and alignment of extracted terms using linguistic and or statistical techniques D jean et al._comma_ 2002 .
E06-2014.txt,6,Inthisprojectweconcentrateonwordsfromthe general lexicon instead of terminology.
E06-2014.txt,7,The rationale for this focus is related to the fact that translation of terms is should be stable_comma_ while general words can vary significantly in their translation.
E06-2014.txt,8,It is important to populate the terminological database with terms that are missed in dictionaries or specific to a problem domain.
E06-2014.txt,9,However_comma_ once the translation of a term in a domain has been identified_comma_ stored in a dictionary and learned by the translator_comma_ the process of translation can go on without consulting a dictionary or a corpus.
E06-2014.txt,10,In contrast_comma_ words from the general lexicon exhibit polysemy_comma_ which is reflected differently in the target language_comma_ thus causing the dependency of their translation on corresponding context.
E06-2014.txt,11,It also happens quite frequently that such variation is not captured by dictionaries.
E06-2014.txt,12,Novice translators tend to rely on dictionaries and use direct translation equivalents whenever they are available.
E06-2014.txt,13,In the end they produce translations that look awkward and do not deliver the meaning intended by the original text.
E06-2014.txt,14,Parallel corpora consisting of original texts aligned with their translations offer the possibility to search for examples of translations in their context.
E06-2014.txt,15,In this respect they provide a useful supplement to decontextualised translation equivalents listed in dictionaries.
E06-2014.txt,16,However_comma_ parallel corpora are not representative millions of pages of original texts are produced daily by native speakers in major languages_comma_ such as English_comma_ while translations are produced by a small community of trained translators from a small subset of source texts.
E06-2014.txt,17,The imbalance between original texts and translations is also reflected in the size of parallel corpora_comma_ which are simply too small for variations in translation of moderately frequent words.
E06-2014.txt,18,For instance_comma_ frustrate occurs 631 times in 100 million words of the BNC_comma_ i.e. this gives in average about 6 uses in a typical parallel corpus of one million words.
E06-2014.txt,19,2 System design 2.1 The research hypothesis Our research hypothesis is that translators can be assistedbysoftwarewhichsuggestscontextualex139 amples in the target language that are semantically and syntactically related to a selected example in the source language.
E06-2014.txt,20,To enable greater coverage we will exploit comparable rather than parallel corpora.
E06-2014.txt,21,Our research hypothesis leads us to a number of research questions Which semantic and syntactic contextual features of the selected example in the source language are important How do we find similar contextual examples in the target language How do we sort the suggested target language contextual examples in order to maximise their usefulness
E06-2014.txt,22,In order to restrict the research to what is achievable within the scope of this project_comma_ we are focussing on translation from English to Russian using a comparable corpus of British and Russian newspaper texts.
E06-2014.txt,23,Newspapers cover a large set of clearly identifiable topics that are comparable across languages and cultures.
E06-2014.txt,24,In this project_comma_ we have collected a 200 million word corpus of four major British newspapers and a 70 millionword corpus of three major Russian newspapers for roughly the same time span 2003 2004 .1 In our proposed method_comma_ contexts of uses of English expressions defined by keywords are compared to similar Russian expressions_comma_ using semantic classes such as persons_comma_ places and institutions.
E06-2014.txt,25,For instance_comma_ the word agreement in the example the parties were frustratingly close to an agreement a241a242a238a240a238a237a251 a225a251a235a232 a228a238 a238a225a232a228a237a238a227a238 a225a235a232a231a234a232 a234 a228a238a241a242a232a230a229a237a232a254 a241a238a227a235a224a248a229a237a232a255 belongs to a semantic class that also includes arrangement_comma_ contract_comma_ deal_comma_ treaty.
E06-2014.txt,26,In the result_comma_ the search for collocates of a225a235a232a231a234a232a233 close in the context of agreement words in Russian gives a short list of modifiers_comma_ which also includes the target a228a238 a238a225a232a228a237a238a227a238 a225a235a232a231a234a232.
E06-2014.txt,27,2.2 Semantic taggers In this project_comma_ we are porting the Lancaster English Semantic Tagger EST to the Russian language.
E06-2014.txt,28,We have reused the existing semantic field taxonomyoftheLancasterUCRELsemanticanalysis system USAS _comma_ and applied it to Russian.
E06-2014.txt,29,We 1Russian newspapers are significantly shorter than their British counterparts. have also reused the existing software framework developed during the construction of a Finnish Semantic Tagger L fberg et al._comma_ 2005 the main adjustments and modifications required for Finnish were to cope with the Unicode character set UTF8 and word compounding.
E06-2014.txt,30,USAS EST is a software system for automatic semantic analysis of text that was designed at Lancaster University Rayson et al._comma_ 2004 .
E06-2014.txt,31,The semantic tagset used by USAS was originally loosely based on Tom McArthur s Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English McArthur_comma_ 1981 .
E06-2014.txt,32,It has a multi tier structure with 21 major discourse fields_comma_ subdivided into 232 sub categories.2 In the ASSIST project_comma_ we have been working on both improving the existing EST and developing a parallel tool for Russian Russian Semantic Tagger RST .We have found that theUSAS semantic categories were compatible with the semantic categorizationsofobjectsandphenomenainRussian_comma_ as in the following example 3 poor JJ I1.1 A5.1 N5 E4.1 X9.1a225a229a228a237a251a233 A I1.1 A6.3 N5 O4.2 E4.1However_comma_ we needed a tool for analysing the complex morpho syntactic structure of Russian words.
E06-2014.txt,33,Unlike English_comma_ Russian is a highly inflected language generally_comma_ what is expressed in English through phrases or syntactic structures is expressed in Russian via morphological inflections_comma_ especially case endings and affixation.
E06-2014.txt,34,For this purpose_comma_ we adopted a Russian morphosyntactic analyser Mystem that identifies word forms_comma_ lemmas and morphological characteristics for each word.
E06-2014.txt,35,Mystem is used as the equivalent of the CLAWS part of speech POS tagger in the USAS framework.
E06-2014.txt,36,Furthermore_comma_ we adopted the Unicode UTF 8 encoding scheme to cope with the Cyrillic alphabet.
E06-2014.txt,37,Despite these modifications_comma_ the architecture of the RST software mirrors that of the EST components in general.
E06-2014.txt,38,The main lexical resources of the RST include a single word lexicon and a lexicon of multi word expressions MWEs .
E06-2014.txt,39,We are building the Russian lexical resources by exploiting both dictionaries and corpora.
E06-2014.txt,40,We use readily available resources_comma_ e.g. lists of proper names_comma_ which are then se2For the full tagset_comma_ see http www.comp.lancs. ac.uk ucrel usas 3I1.1 Money lack A5.1 Evaluation bad N5 Quantities little E4.1 Unhappy X9.1 Ability_comma_ intelligence poor A6.3 Comparing little variety O4.2 Judgement of appearance bad 140 mantically classified.
E06-2014.txt,41,To bootstrap the system_comma_ we have hand tagged the 3_comma_000 most frequent Russian words based on a large newspaper corpus.
E06-2014.txt,42,Subsequently_comma_ the lexicons will be further expanded by feeding texts from various sources into the RST and classifying words that remain unmatched.
E06-2014.txt,43,In addition_comma_ we will experiment with semi automatic lexicon construction using an existing machinereadable English Russian bilingual dictionary to populate the Russian lexicon by mapping words from eachof thesemantic fieldsin theEnglish lexicon in turn.
E06-2014.txt,44,We aim at coverage of around 30_comma_000 single lexical items and up to 9_comma_000 MWEs_comma_ compared to the EST which currently contains 54_comma_727 single lexical items and 18_comma_814 MWEs.
E06-2014.txt,45,2.3 The user interface The interface is powered by IMS Corpus Workbench Christ_comma_ 1994 and is designed to be used in the day to day workflow of novice and practising translators_comma_ so the syntax of the CWB query language has been simplified to adapt it to the needs of the target user community.
E06-2014.txt,46,The interface implements a search model for finding translation equivalents in monolingual comparable corpora_comma_ which integrates a number of statistical and rule based techniques for extending search space_comma_ translating words and multiword expressions into the target language and restricting thenumberofreturnedcandidatesinordertomaximise precision and recall of relevant translation equivalents.
E06-2014.txt,47,In the proposed search model queries canbeexpandedbygeneratinglistsofcollocations for a given word or phrase_comma_ by generating similarity classes4 or by manual selection of words in concordances.
E06-2014.txt,48,Transfer between the source language and target language is done via lookup in a bilingual dictionary or via UCREL semantic codes_comma_ which are common for concepts in both languages.
E06-2014.txt,49,The search space is further restricted by applying knowledge based and statistical filters such as part of speech and semantic class filters_comma_ IDF filter_comma_ etc _comma_ by testing the co occurrence of members of different similarity classes or by manually selecting the presented variants.
E06-2014.txt,50,These procedures are elementary building blocks that are used in designing different search strategies efficient for different types of translation equivalents 4Simclasses consist of words sharing collocates and are computed using Singular Value Decomposition_comma_ as used by Rapp_comma_ 2004 _comma_ e.g.
E06-2014.txt,51,Paris and Strasbourg are produced for Brussels_comma_ or bus_comma_ tram and driver for passenger. and contexts.
E06-2014.txt,52,The core functionality of the system is intended to be self explanatory and to have a shallow learning curve in many cases default search parameters work well_comma_ so it is sufficient to input a word or an expression in the source language in order to get back a useful list of translation equivalents_comma_ which can be manually checked by a translator to identify the most suitable solution for a given context.
E06-2014.txt,53,For example_comma_ the word combination frustrated passenger is not found in the majorEnglish Russiandictionaries_comma_ whilenoneofthe candidate translations of frustrated are suitable in this context.
E06-2014.txt,54,The default search strategy for this phrase is to generate the similarity class for English words frustrate_comma_ passenger_comma_ produce all possible translations using a dictionary and to test cooccurrenceoftheresultingRussianwordsintarget language corpora.
E06-2014.txt,55,This returns a list of 32 Russian phrases_comma_ which follow the pattern of annoyed impatient unhappy commuter passenger driver .
E06-2014.txt,56,Among other examples the list includes an appropriate translation a237a229a228a238a226a238a235a252a237a251a233 a239a224a241a241a224a230a232a240 unsatisfied passenger .
E06-2014.txt,57,The following example demonstrates the system s ability to find equivalents when there is a reliable context to identify terms in the two languages.
E06-2014.txt,58,Recent political developments in Russia produced a new expression a239a240a229a228a241a242a224a226a232a242a229a235a252 a239a240a229a231a232a228a229a237a242a224 representative of president _comma_ which is as yet too novel to be listed in dictionaries.
E06-2014.txt,59,However_comma_ the system can help to identify the people that perform this duty_comma_ translate their names to English and extract the set of collocates that frequently appear around their names in British newspapers_comma_ including Putin s personal envoy and Putin s regional representative_comma_ even if no specific term has been established for this purpose in the British media.
E06-2014.txt,60,As words cannot be translated in isolation and their potential translation equivalents also often consist of several words_comma_ the system detects not only single word collocates_comma_ but also multiword expressions.
E06-2014.txt,61,For instance_comma_ the set of Russian collocates of a225a254a240a238a234a240a224a242a232a255 bureaucracy includes a193a240a254a241a241a229a235a252 Brussels _comma_ which offers a straightforward translation into English and has such multiword collocates as red tape_comma_ which is a suitable contextual translation for a225a254a240a238a234a240a224a242a232a255.
E06-2014.txt,62,More experienced users can modify default parameters and try alternative strategies_comma_ construct 141 their own search paths from available basic building blocks and store them for future use.
E06-2014.txt,63,Stored strategies comprise several elementary stages but are executed in one go_comma_ although intermediate results can also be accessed via the history frame.
E06-2014.txt,64,Several search paths can be tried in parallel and displayed together_comma_ so an optimal strategy for a given class of phrases can be more easily identified.
E06-2014.txt,65,Unlike Machine Translation_comma_ the system does not translate texts.
E06-2014.txt,66,The main thrust of the systemliesinitsabilitytofindseveraltargetlanguage examples that are relevant to the source language expression.
E06-2014.txt,67,In some cases this results in suggestions that can be directly used for translating the source example_comma_ while in other cases the system provides hints for the translator about the range of target language expressions beyond what is available in bilingual dictionaries.
E06-2014.txt,68,Even if the precision of the current version is not satisfactory for an MT system 2 3 suitable translations out of 30 50 suggested examples _comma_ human translators are able to skim through the suggested set to find what is relevant for the given translation task.
E06-2014.txt,69,3 Conclusions The set of tools is now under further development.
E06-2014.txt,70,This involves an extension of the English semantic tagger_comma_ development of the Russian tagger with the target lexical coverage of 90 of source texts_comma_ designing the procedure for retrieval of semantically similar situations and completing the user interface.
E06-2014.txt,71,Identification of semantically similar situations can be improved by the use of segmentmatching algorithms as employed in ExampleBased MT and translation memories Planas and Furuse_comma_ 2000 Carl and Way_comma_ 2003 .
E06-2014.txt,72,There are two main applications of the proposed methodology.
E06-2014.txt,73,One concerns training translators and advanced foreign language FL learners to make them aware of the variety of translation equivalents beyond the set offered by the dictionary.
E06-2014.txt,74,The other application pertains to the development of tools for practising translators.
E06-2014.txt,75,Although the Russian language is not typologically close to English and uses another writing system which does not allow easy identification of cognates_comma_ Russian and English belong to the same Indo European family and the contents of Russian and English newspapers reflect the same set of topics.
E06-2014.txt,76,Nevertheless_comma_ the application of this research need not be restricted to the EnglishRussian pair only.
E06-2014.txt,77,The methodology for multilingual processing of monolingual comparable corpora_comma_ first tested in this project_comma_ will provide a blueprint for the development of similar tools for other language combinations.

E06-2018.txt,1,paper quantitatively investigates in how far local context is useful to disambiguate the senses of an ambiguous word. This is done by comparing the co occurrence frequencies of particular context words.
E06-2018.txt,2,First_comma_ one context word representing a certain sense is chosen_comma_ and then the co occurrence frequencies with two other context words_comma_ one of the same and one of another sense_comma_ are compared.
E06-2018.txt,3,As expected_comma_ it turns out that context words belonging to the same sense have considerably higher co occurrence frequencies than words belonging to different senses.
E06-2018.txt,4,In our study_comma_ the sense inventory is taken from the University of South Florida homograph norms_comma_ and the co occurrence counts are based on the British National Corpus.
E06-2018.txt,6,Word sense induction and disambiguation is of importance for many tasks in speech and language processing_comma_ such as speech recognition_comma_ machine translation_comma_ natural language understanding_comma_ question answering_comma_ and information retrieval.
E06-2018.txt,7,As evidenced by several SENSEVAL sense disambiguation competitions Kilgarriff Palmer_comma_ 2000 _comma_ statistical methods are dominant in this field.
E06-2018.txt,8,However_comma_ none of the published algorithms comes close to human performance in word sense disambiguation_comma_ and it is therefore unclear in how far the statistical regularities that are exploited in these algorithms are a solid basis to eventually solve the problem.
E06-2018.txt,9,Although this is a difficult question_comma_ in this study we try to give at least a partial answer.
E06-2018.txt,10,Our starting point is the observation that ambiguous words can usually be disambiguated by their context_comma_ and that certain context words can be seen as indicators of certain senses.
E06-2018.txt,11,For example_comma_ context words such as finger and arm are typical of the hand meaning of palm_comma_ whereas coconut and oil are typical of its tree meaning.
E06-2018.txt,12,The essence behind many algorithms for word sense disambiguation is to implicitly or explicitly classify all possible context words into groups relating to one or another sense.
E06-2018.txt,13,This can be done in a supervised Yarowsky_comma_ 1994 _comma_ a semi supervised Yarowsky_comma_ 1995 or a fully unsupervised way Pantel Lin_comma_ 2002 .
E06-2018.txt,14,However_comma_ the classification can only work if the statistical clues are clear enough and if there are not too many exceptions.
E06-2018.txt,15,In terms of word co occurrence statistics_comma_ we can say that within the local contexts of an ambiguous word_comma_ context words typical of the same sense should have high co occurrence counts_comma_ whereas context words associated with different senses should have cooccurrence counts that are considerably lower.
E06-2018.txt,16,Although the relative success of previous disambiguation systems e.g. Yarowsky_comma_ 1995 suggests that this should be the case_comma_ the effect has usually not been quantified as the emphasis was on a task based evaluation.
E06-2018.txt,17,Also_comma_ in most cases the amount of context to be used has not been systematically examined.
E06-2018.txt,18,2 Methodology Our starting point is a list of 288 ambiguous words homographs where each comes together with two associated words that are typical of one sense and a third associated word that is typical of another sense.
E06-2018.txt,19,Table 1 shows the first ten entries in the list.
E06-2018.txt,20,It has been derived from the University of South Florida homograph norms Nelson et al._comma_ 1980 and is based on a combination of native speakers intuition and the expertise of specialists.
E06-2018.txt,21,The University of South Florida homograph norms comprise 320 words which were all selected from Roget s International Thesaurus 1962 .
E06-2018.txt,22,Each word has at least two distinct meanings that were judged as likely to be understood by everyone.
E06-2018.txt,23,As described in detail in Nelson et al. 1980 _comma_ the compilation of the norms was conducted as follows 46 subjects wrote down the first word that came to mind for each of the 320 homographs.
E06-2018.txt,24,In the next step_comma_ for each homograph semantic categories were chosen to reflect 155 its meanings.
E06-2018.txt,25,All associative responses given by the subjects were assigned to one of these categories.
E06-2018.txt,26,This was first done by four judges individually_comma_ and then_comma_ before final categorization_comma_ each response was discussed until a consensus was achieved.
E06-2018.txt,27,The data used in our study first ten items shown in Table 1 was extracted from these norms by selecting for each homograph the first two words relating to its first meaning and the first word relating to its second meaning.
E06-2018.txt,28,Thereby we had to abandon those homographs where all of the subjects responses had been assigned to a single category_comma_ so that only one category appeared in the homograph norms.
E06-2018.txt,29,This was the case for 32 words_comma_ which is the reason that our list comprises only 288 instead of 320 items.
E06-2018.txt,30,Another resource that we use is the British National Corpus BNC _comma_ which is a balanced sample of written and spoken English that comprises about 100 million words Burnard Aston_comma_ 1998 .
E06-2018.txt,31,This corpus was used without special preprocessing_comma_ i.e. stop words were not removed and no stemming was conducted.
E06-2018.txt,32,From the corpus we extracted concordances comprising text windows of a certain width e.g. plus and minus 20 words around the given word for each of the 288 homographs.
E06-2018.txt,33,For each concordance we computed two counts The first is the number of concordance lines where the two words associated with sense 1 occur together.
E06-2018.txt,34,The second is the number of concordance lines where the first word associated with sense 1 and the word associated with sense 2 co occur.
E06-2018.txt,35,The expectation is that the first count should be higher as words associated to the same sense should co occur more often than words associated to different senses. sense 1 sense 2homograph firstasso ciation w1 secondasso ciation w2 firstasso ciation w3 arm leg hand war ball game base dance bar drink beer crow bark dog loud tree base ball line bottom bass fish trout drum bat ball boy fly bay Tampa water hound bear animal woods weight beam wood ceiling light Table 1.
E06-2018.txt,36,First ten of 288 homographs and some associations to their first and second senses.
E06-2018.txt,37,However_comma_ as absolute word frequencies can vary over several orders of magnitude and as this effect could influence our co occurrence counts in an undesired way_comma_ we decided to take this into account by dividing the co occurrence counts by the concordance frequency of the second words in our pairs.
E06-2018.txt,38,We did not normalize for the frequency of the first word as it is identical for both pairs and therefore represents a constant factor.
E06-2018.txt,39,Note that we normalized for the observed frequency within the concordance and not within the entire corpus.
E06-2018.txt,40,If we denote the first word associated to sense 1 with w1_comma_ the second word associated with sense 1 with w2_comma_ and the word associated with sense 2 with w3_comma_ the two scores s1 and s2 that we compute can be described as follows In cases where the denominator was zero we assigned a score of zero to the whole expression.
E06-2018.txt,41,For all 288 homographs we compared s1 to s2.
E06-2018.txt,42,If it turns out that in the vast majority of cases s1 is higher than s2_comma_ then this result would be an indicator that it is promising to use such co occurrence statistics for the assignment of context words to senses.
E06-2018.txt,43,On the other hand_comma_ should this not be the case_comma_ the conclusion would be that this approach does not have the potential to work and should be discarded.
E06-2018.txt,44,As in statistics the results are often not as clear cut as would be desirable_comma_ for comparison we conducted another experiment to help us with the interpretation.
E06-2018.txt,45,This time the question was whether our results were caused by properties of the homographs or if we had only measured properties of the context words w1_comma_ w2 and w3.
E06-2018.txt,46,The idea was to conduct the same experiment again_comma_ but this time not based on concordances but on the entire corpus.
E06-2018.txt,47,However_comma_ considering the entire corpus would make it necessary to use a different kind of text window for counting the co occurrences as there would be no given word to center the text window around_comma_ which could lead to artefacts and make the comparison problematic.
E06-2018.txt,48,We therefore decided to use concordances again_comma_ but this time not the concordances of the homographs first column in Table 1 but the concordances of all 288 instances of w1 second column in Table 1 .
E06-2018.txt,49,This way we had exactly number of lines where w1 and w2 co occurs1 occurrence count of w2 within concordance number of lines where w1 and w3 co occurs2 occurrence count of w3 within concordance 156 the same window type as in the first experiment_comma_ but this time the entire corpus was taken into account as all co occurrences of w2 or w3 with w1 must necessarily appear within the concordance of w1.
E06-2018.txt,50,We name the scores resulting from this experiment s3 and s4_comma_ where s3 corresponds to s1 and s4 corresponds to s2_comma_ with the only difference being that the concordances of the homographs are replaced by the concordances of the instances of w1.
E06-2018.txt,51,Regarding the interpretation of the results_comma_ if the ratio between s3 and s4 should turn out to be similar to the ratio between s1 and s2_comma_ then the influence of the homographs would be marginally or non existent.
E06-2018.txt,52,If there should be a major difference_comma_ then this would give evidence that_comma_ as desired_comma_ a property of the homograph has been measured.
E06-2018.txt,53,3 Results and discussion Following the procedure described in the previous section_comma_ Table 2 gives some quantitative results.
E06-2018.txt,54,It shows the overall results for the homograph based concordance and for the w1 based concordance for different concordance widths.
E06-2018.txt,55,In each case not only the number of cases is given where the results correspond to expectations s1 s2 and s3 s4 _comma_ but also the number of cases where the outcome is undecided s1 s2 and s3 s4 .
E06-2018.txt,56,Although this adds some redundancy_comma_ for convenience also the number of cases with an unexpected outcome is listed.
E06-2018.txt,57,All three numbers sum up to 288 which is the total number of homographs considered.
E06-2018.txt,58,If we look at the left half of Table 2 which shows the results for the concordances based on the homographs_comma_ we can see that the number of correct cases steadily increases with increasing width of the concordance until a width of 300 is reached.
E06-2018.txt,59,At the same time_comma_ the number of undecided cases rapidly goes down.
E06-2018.txt,60,At a concordance width of 300_comma_ the number of correct cases 201 outnumbers the number of incorrect cases 63 by a factor of 3.2.
E06-2018.txt,61,Note that the increase of incorrect cases is probably mostly an artefact of the sparsedata problem as the number of undecided cases decreases faster than the number of correct cases increases.
E06-2018.txt,62,On the right half of Table 2 the results for the concordances based on w1 are given.
E06-2018.txt,63,Here the number of correct cases starts at a far higher level for small concordance widths_comma_ increases up to a concordance width of 10 where it reaches its maximum_comma_ and then decreases slowly.
E06-2018.txt,64,At the concordance width of 10 the ratio between correct and incorrect cases is 2.6.
E06-2018.txt,65,How can we now interpret these results
E06-2018.txt,66,What we can say for sure when we look at the number of undecided cases is that the problem of data sparseness is much more severe if we consider the concordances of the homographs rather than the concordances of w1.
E06-2018.txt,67,This outcome can be expected as in the first case we only take a usually small fraction of the full corpus into account_comma_ whereas the second case is equivalent to considering the full corpus.
E06-2018.txt,68,What we can also say is that the optimal concordance width depends on data sparseness.
E06-2018.txt,69,If data is more sparse_comma_ we need a wider concordance width to obtain best results. concordance of homograph concordance of w1concordance width s1 s2correct s1 s2undecided s1 s2incorrect s3 s4correct s3 s4undecided s3 s4incorrect 1 1 287 0 107 135 46 2 15 273 0 158 69 61 3 32 249 7 179 40 69 5 54 222 12 194 21 73 10 81 181 26 199 13 76 20 126 127 35 196 7 85 30 129 105 44 192 5 91 50 165 69 54 192 2 94 100 182 44 62 185 1 102 200 198 29 61 177 1 110 300 201 24 63 177 1 110 500 199 19 70 171 1 116 Table 2.
E06-2018.txt,70,Results for homograph based concordance left and for w1 based concordance right .
E06-2018.txt,71,157 In case of the full corpus the optimal width is around 10 which is similar to average sentence length.
E06-2018.txt,72,Larger windows seem to reduce saliency and therefore affect the results adversely.
E06-2018.txt,73,In comparison_comma_ if we look at the concordances of the homographs_comma_ the negative effect on saliency with increasing concordance width seems to be more than outweighed by the decrease in sparseness_comma_ as the results at a very large width of 300 are better than the best results for the full corpus.
E06-2018.txt,74,However_comma_ if we used a much larger corpus than the BNC_comma_ it can be expected that best results would be achieved at a smaller width_comma_ and that these are likely to be better than the ones achieved using the BNC.
E06-2018.txt,75,4 Conclusions and future work Our experiments showed that associations belonging to the same sense of a homograph have far higher co occurrence counts than associations belonging to different senses.
E06-2018.txt,76,This is especially true when we look at the concordances of the homographs_comma_ but to a somewhat lesser extend also when we look at the full corpus.
E06-2018.txt,77,The discrepancy between the two approaches can probably be enlarged by increasing the size of the corpus.
E06-2018.txt,78,However_comma_ further investigations are necessary to verify this claim.
E06-2018.txt,79,With the approach based on the concordances of the homographs best results were achieved with concordance widths that are about an order of magnitude larger than average sentence length.
E06-2018.txt,80,However_comma_ human performance shows that the context within a sentence usually suffices to disambiguate a word.
E06-2018.txt,81,A much larger corpus could possibly solve this problem as it should allow to reduce concordance width without loosing accuracy.
E06-2018.txt,82,However_comma_ since human language acquisition seems to be based on the reception of only in the order of 100 million words Landauer Dumais_comma_ 1997_comma_ p. 222 _comma_ and because the BNC already is of that size_comma_ there also must be another solution to this problem.
E06-2018.txt,83,Our suggestion is to not look at the co occurrence frequencies of single word pairs_comma_ but at the average co occurrence frequencies between several pairs derived from larger groups of words.
E06-2018.txt,84,Let us illustrate this by coming back to our example in the .
E03-1062.txt,1,paper describes the NECA MNLG a fully implemented Multimodal Natural Language Generation module. The MNLG is deployed as part of the NECA system which generates dialogues between animated agents.
E03-1062.txt,2,The generation module supports the seamless integration of full grammar rules_comma_ templates and canned text.
E03-1062.txt,3,The generator takes input which allows for the specification of syntactic_comma_ semantic and pragmatic constraints on the output.
E03-1062.txt,5,This paper introduces the NECA MNLG a Multimodal Natural Language Generator.

E89-1040.txt,1,research in the area of machine translation usually involves the search for and creation of an appropriate formalism. An important issue in this respect is the way in which the compositionality of translation is to be defined.
E89-1040.txt,2,In this paper_comma_ we will introduce the anaphoric component of the Mimo formalism.
E89-1040.txt,3,It makes the definition and translation of anaphoric relations possible_comma_ relations which are usually problematic for systems that adhere to strict compositionality.
E89-1040.txt,4,In iVlimo_comma_ the translation of anaphoric relations is compositional.
E89-1040.txt,5,The anaphoric component is used to define linguistic phenomena such as wh movement_comma_ the passive and the binding of reflexives and pronouns monolingually.
E89-1040.txt,6,The actual working of the component will be shown in this paper by means of a detailed discussion of wh movement. .
E89-1040.txt,7,Theoretical research as part of machine translation often aims at finding an appropriate formalism.
E89-1040.txt,8,One of the main issues involved is whether the formalism does full justice to the idea that the translation of a whole is built from the translation of its parts on the one hand and whether it leaves enough room for the treatment of exceptions on the other hand.
E89-1040.txt,9,In other words_comma_ the question is in what way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within a particular formalism.
E89-1040.txt,10,An answer to this question from an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the Rosetta system e.g. Landsbergen 1985 .
E89-1040.txt,12,The MiMo formalism is a reaction to the CAT framework and tries to solve several translation problems by formulating an alternative definition of compositionality.
E89-1040.txt,13,Phenomena involving anaphora I such as wh movement and the coindexation of pronominais often cause problems for strictly compositional systems since translation of one word depends on the translation of another word_comma_ one which can be quite far away in the sentence.
E89-1040.txt,14,Rosetta tackles this problem by distinguishing between rules that are significant with respect to the composRionality of translation_comma_ so called meaningful rules_comma_ and rules that are not_comma_ referred to as transformations Appelo et al. 1987 in this way the system is not compositional in the strict sense anymore.
E89-1040.txt,15,The notion of compositlonaUty MiMo adheres to is defined in such a way that anaphoric relations can be translated compositionally as well.
E89-1040.txt,16,In this paper we wiLi introduce the anaphoric component of the MiMo formalism.
E89-1040.txt,17,It is used to define Linguistic phenomena such as wh movement_comma_ the binding of reflexives and pronouns_comma_ the passive and control phenomena monolinguaLiy.
E89-1040.txt,18,The formalism will be discussed by means of an extensive description of a possible analysis of wh movement.
E89-1040.txt,19,In the next section_comma_ we will first discuss and motivate some of the more fundamental characteristics of the MiMo translation system.
E89-1040.txt,20,Section two will sketch the MiMo formalism 1In thls paper the term ansphori should be interpreted in the broaclest lense_comma_ as opposed to Chomsky 1981 in which only A traces and reflexives are called anaphoric.
E89-1040.txt,21,299as far as necessary for understanding what will follow.
E89-1040.txt,22,The component that deais with the treatment of anaphora will be discussed in section 3.
E89-1040.txt,23,In the fourth section the actual working of the component will be shown by an elaborate discussion of wh movement.
E89-1040.txt,24,Finaily_comma_ the translation of anaphoric relations will be defined and some idea will be given of the kind of problems that remain and that will have to be subject to further research.
E89-1040.txt,25,1 MiMo The MiMo formalism tries to come up with an answer to the question what compositional translation should imply.
E89-1040.txt,26,Strictly compositional systems have to deal with several translation problems.
E89-1040.txt,27,As to what these problems exactly are depends on the nature of the definition of the notion compositionality.
E89-1040.txt,28,In general_comma_ two kinds of problems can be distinguished.
E89-1040.txt,29,First_comma_ there are the problems that arise when languages do not really match.
E89-1040.txt,30,Second_comma_ the problems that occur when translations of two constructions depend on one another.
E89-1040.txt,31,The former type of problem is caused by lexical and structural holes.
E89-1040.txt,32,It means that source and target representation do not really match.
E89-1040.txt,33,Lexical holes occur when a language lacks words equivalent to the ones in the source language.
E89-1040.txt,34,In the case of structural holes_comma_ the target language lacks an equivalent construction rather than a word.
E89-1040.txt,35,A description of the concept will have to be used in these cases.
E89-1040.txt,36,For an example of a lexical hole_comma_ compare sentence 1 and its translation into English 2 .
E89-1040.txt,37,1 Jan zwemt graag 2 John likes to swim Unlike sentences with an adverb like vandaag _comma_ i cannot be translated c0mpositionally in the strictest sense.
E89-1040.txt,38,The translation of 1 is not simply the translation of the parts the constituent is composed of.
E89-1040.txt,39,This problem has been solved in the CAT framework by liberalizing the definition of compositionaiity in such a way that it will be possible to render 1 directly into 2 _comma_ by means of a rule like 3 .
E89-1040.txt,40,4 Jan zwom ge_comma_oonlijk John used to swim 5 Jan zwom gewoonlijk graag John used to like to swim The translation of gewoonlijk requires a rule similar to 3 .
E89-1040.txt,41,However_comma_ a combination of graag and gewoonlijk appears to be possible as well.
E89-1040.txt,42,An additional rule will have to account for this.
E89-1040.txt,43,This will lead to an enormous explosion of the number of rules.
E89-1040.txt,44,It is one of the main reasons for an alternative definition of compositionality within the MiMo system.
E89-1040.txt,45,The nature of the definition allows the translation of both gewoonlijk and graag in case they cooccur.
E89-1040.txt,46,A translation rule separates a constituent into an ordinary part and an exceptional part.
E89-1040.txt,47,Both parts are then translated separately and finally_comma_ in the target language_comma_ the two translated parts are joined again.
E89-1040.txt,48,In the case of a sentence consisting of both graag and gewoonUjk _comma_ the sentence is separated into an exceptional part_comma_ graag for example_comma_ and an ordinary part_comma_ the rest of the sentence.
E89-1040.txt,49,This rest again is separated into an exceptional_comma_ gewoonlijk _comma_ and an ordinary part.
E89-1040.txt,50,The latter is again that which is left behind after extraction of the exceptional part.
E89-1040.txt,51,In the end_comma_ all these parts are joined and will make up a construction in the target language.
E89-1040.txt,52,So_comma_ in MiMo not all daughters are translated in one shot but part of a constituent is translated while the rules can still work on the rest of the constituent.
E89-1040.txt,53,An extensive discussion ofproblerns like these is to be found in Arnold e.a 1988 .
E89-1040.txt,54,The second type of problems w.r.t compositionality in translation involves translation of phrases that are mutually dependent.
E89-1040.txt,55,Examples hereof are translations of phrases that are anaphorically linked.
E89-1040.txt,56,Translation requires that these relations are established.
E89-1040.txt,57,Examples are to be found in 8 .
E89-1040.txt,58,In 6 _comma_ the relation between the subject and the refiexive pronominal is necessary to arrive at the correct form of the reflexive pronominal in French.
E89-1040.txt,59,In 7 _comma_ knowledge of the functional status of the wh word is relevant to be able to generate the right case in German.
E89-1040.txt,60,6 the women think of themselves les femmes pensent a elles memes ils memes 7 who did you see wen wer wem sahest du 3 rl sl_comma_s2_comma_graag  r2 t sl _comma_r3 like_comma_t s2 By 3 a construction composed of three daughters_comma_ sl_comma_ s2 and graag will be translated into a construction having two daughters_comma_ viz. the translation of sl and a construction that again has two daughters_comma_ that is_comma_ the verb like and the translation of s2.
E89-1040.txt,61,The main disadvantage of this approach is the fact that combinations of exceptions have to be described explicitly again_comma_ see 4 and 5 .
E89-1040.txt,62,In this paper we will examine the component of the MiMo formalism that has been developed to enable the formula. tion of anaphoric relations on the one hand and compositional translation on .the other.
E89-1040.txt,63,The system distinguishes itself from other systems in the field of computational linguistics_comma_ such as GPSG Gazdar et al. 1985 _comma_ PATR see e.g. Shieber 1986 and DCG Pereira and Warren 1980 for its central notion of modularity.
E89-1040.txt,64,The formalism enables 300 the writer of rules to express generalizations in a simple and declarative way.
E89-1040.txt,65,This will be exemplified in section 4.
E89-1040.txt,66,In an MT context_comma_ it is however not enough to establish anaphoric relations monolingually.
E89-1040.txt,67,The question is what the behaviour of these relations in translation is.
E89-1040.txt,68,In MiMo_comma_ it is possible to translate the relations compositionally.
E89-1040.txt,69,This will be discussed in section 5.
E89-1040.txt,70,2 The basic model In this section an overview of the MiMo system will be given as far as is relevant for the rest of this paper.
E89-1040.txt,71,The system s architecture is as in 8 .
E89-1040.txt,73,Fillers of these slots will have to be nominal.
E89-1040.txt,74,The subject slot has been filled by an I structure that has john as LI_comma_ the object slot by the I structure with LI mary .
E89-1040.txt,75,We will abbreviate structures like these as in 10 henceforth.
E89-1040.txt,76,So_comma_ an I structure consists of a certain LI_comma_ a feature bundle in parenthesis and a number of slots in square brackets preceded by a dot.
E89-1040.txt,77,A slot is made up of the name followed by the equal sign and the I structure that fills it.
E89-1040.txt,78,Possible I structures are defined in the lexicon.
E89-1040.txt,79,Distinct phrase structure rules that define I structures are not needed_comma_ all structures are specified in the lexicon.
E89-1040.txt,80,Generalizations should be expressed in the lexicon as well.
E89-1040.txt,81,The advantage of this approach is the possibility of defining all subcategorization phenomena directly.
E89-1040.txt,82,So_comma_ only coherent structures in the sense of LFG Bresnan 1982 are built.
E89-1040.txt,83,In the lexicon_comma_ the slots have not yet been filled by other I structures.
E89-1040.txt,84,The I structure for kiss looks like 11 in the lexicon_comma_ the question marks indicate that the slot are still empty.
E89-1040.txt,85,In 12 the lexical representation of john is given_comma_ which has no slots.
E89-1040.txt,88,The representation of modifiers is s field in MT that deserves further attention.
E89-1040.txt,89,SNote that the order of slots is quite arbitrary.
E89-1040.txt,90,Surface order is not reI ted to the order of slots in l structures in any way.
E89-1040.txt,91,301 anaphor .
E89-1040.txt,92,I structures having this feature will have to be bound by an antecedent in the end.
E89-1040.txt,93,Examples of these are pronouns and reflexives.
E89-1040.txt,94,This requirement also holds for empty slots.
E89-1040.txt,95,They are considered anaphoric and will have to be bound as well unless we deal with optional slots.
E89-1040.txt,96,Binding of I structures happens through anaphoric rules.
E89-1040.txt,97,In the next section we will show the way these rules are formulated.
E89-1040.txt,98,The final structure of 13a will be 14 .
E89-1040.txt,99,In 14 _comma_ a relation between the topic Ii and the embedded subject position I2 4 is established s .
E89-1040.txt,101,Even sentences that do not show a complernentizer at surface are assigned one.
E89-1040.txt,102,This is not in any way intrinsic to MiMo but makes a uniform account of several phenomena possible.
E89-1040.txt,103,This type of cornplementizer has two slots an optional slot for topics or wh words and a slot for a verb construction.
E89-1040.txt,104,3 The definition of anaphoric relations Anaphoric relations are defined by a type of rule that is quite different from the ordinary rules.
E89-1040.txt,105,This distinguishes the system from_comma_ for example DCG.
E89-1040.txt,106,With PATR and DCG the possibility of percolation from_comma_ say topic to trace_comma_ influences all the other rules.
E89-1040.txt,107,MiMo s approach_comma_ a separate type of rule for the anaphoric component_comma_ has the advantage of leaving the other rules_comma_ i.e the lexical I structures_comma_ as they are.
E89-1040.txt,108,Modularity is one of MiMo s qualities.
E89-1040.txt,109,This quality is also considered important in GPSG Gasdar et al. 1985 where it is realized by the use of metarules that multiply the number of rules.
E89-1040.txt,110,This would be undesirable in MiMo 411 and I2 are unique nantes which are autonmtlcally assigned to every I structure.
E89-1040.txt,111,We will indicate them henceforth as capitalized words.
E89-1040.txt,112,Names to which no further reference is nmde will be omitted for clarlty s sake.
E89-1040.txt,113,An I structure consists of a tree and 8 set of annotstlons that denote the anaphoric relations within the tree.
E89-1040.txt,114,The tree annotated with this set will be called I object henceforth.
E89-1040.txt,115,6Note that we will usually leave out optional slots thet are not KUed since every lexical word is its own rule.
E89-1040.txt,116,So then even the number of words would have to be multiplied.
E89-1040.txt,117,The use of a different rule type is also motivated by the process of translating anaphoric relations.
E89-1040.txt,118,If we only used feature percolation to encode anaphoric relations_comma_ the relations established would not be explicit anymore.
E89-1040.txt,119,Annotations in MiMo are clearly distinguishable from the rest of the representation and as such make it possible to define a compositional translation of them in transfer.
E89-1040.txt,120,Besides being modular_comma_ the system also proves to be declarative.
E89-1040.txt,121,Both qualities_comma_ modularity and declarativity_comma_ enhance the workability for the user.
E89-1040.txt,122,Changes and extensions are quite easily achieved and rules can be defined in a general way.
E89-1040.txt,123,An anaphoric component written for one particular language can often be used for another language with minor changes.
E89-1040.txt,124,Anaphoric rules create anaphoric relations within Istructures.
E89-1040.txt,125,This has two consequences in our system.
E89-1040.txt,126,In the first place_comma_ some of the features of antecedent and anaphor are unified.
E89-1040.txt,127,These features are called transparent .
E89-1040.txt,128,This_comma_ for example_comma_ makes it possible to define agreement phenomena.
E89-1040.txt,129,The linguist defines which features are transparent with respect to a certain rule.
E89-1040.txt,130,The motivation for this approach is discussed at length in Krauwer et al. 1987 .
E89-1040.txt,131,The main point is that identity of some but not all features is required in an antecedent anaphor relation.
E89-1040.txt,132,In the second place_comma_ the I structure is augmented with an annotation that specifies the binding.
E89-1040.txt,133,This annotation consists of the name of the relation and the unique names of the nodes between which the relation exists.
E89-1040.txt,134,The definition of anaphoric relations makes use of these annotations see also section 5 .
E89-1040.txt,135,A relation cannot be created unless the correct structural relation between antecedent and anaphor exists.
E89-1040.txt,136,So the grammar writer defines for each relation 1 the name of the relation 2 the transparent features 3 the structural relation An example of an anaphoric rule is the one that establishes a relation between a wh element and an open slot.
E89-1040.txt,137,The rule looks like 15 e MiMo 7 .
E89-1040.txt,138,15 wh_trace c_command wh _comma_ open agreement_comma_case The wh trace relation is established when the structural relation c_cornnmnd holds between a wh constituent and eIn f ct_comma_ the wh trace rel tlon is subject to more restrlct ons than c commandment.
E89-1040.txt,139,We will return to this in section 4.
E89-1040.txt,140,7A special feature open is used to refer to open slots.
E89-1040.txt,141,All slots have this feature by default as long they are not filled.
E89-1040.txt,142,Sot open can be regarded as a feature of the trace nce slots not yet FtUed can he considered potential traces.
E89-1040.txt,143,302an open slot The agreement features and the case feature are unified if possible_comma_ if not_comma_ the relation will not be established.
E89-1040.txt,144,The structural relation itself_comma_ c_command in this case_comma_ is defined by the user as well.
E89-1040.txt,145,Either a simple structural relation is defined or a complex structural relation.
E89-1040.txt,146,The latter is composed of a regular expression over structural relations s .
E89-1040.txt,147,An example of a simple structural relation is the sister relation_comma_ defined in 16 .
E89-1040.txt,149,The regular expressions make use of the operators _comma_ indicating optionality_comma_  for disjunction_comma_  for iterativity 0_comma_ 1 or more times and .
E89-1040.txt,150,The latter has a special meaning which can best be explained by means of the definition of the c_command relation mentioned in 17 .
E89-1040.txt,151,The  operator indicates that the sister relation should hold between the antecedent and some intermediate node and the ancestorrelation between this intermediate node and the anaphor.
E89-1040.txt,152,The Prolog variant of 17 is 18 So_comma_ the c_command relation holds between the I structures ANT and ANA when one of ANT s sisters is ANA s ancestor.
E89-1040.txt,153,The MiMo defini 18 c_command Ant_comma_Ana sister Ant_comma_X _comma_ ancestor X_comma_Ana . tion of ancestor is given in 19a .
E89-1040.txt,154,The relation is defined in terms of the simple relation mother .
E89-1040.txt,155,The structural relation of the latter is in 19b 1 .
E89-1040.txt,156,Features can be added to the structural pattern to restrict the range of possible relations further.
E89-1040.txt,157,This will be illustrated in the fourth section when we discuss a possible way of treating wh movement.
E89-1040.txt,158,To aThls idea il partly based on LFG s notion of functional uncertainty.
E89-1040.txt,159,See Kaplan et al. 1987.
E89-1040.txt,160,Note that the order of ANT w.r.t ANA is not relevant since the order of the slots is not in any way related to word order in the sentence.
E89-1040.txt,161,l All I structures are also their own ancestor according to the deftnlt onin 19a .
E89-1040.txt,162,This is the correct result when used in the c_command deKnltlon since sisters do c_command one another.
E89-1040.txt,163,In case this is uno desirable however_comma_ the relation could be defined as follows ancestor mother  mother Generally_comma_ the correct deKrdtlon of a relation llke c.command depends of course on the use it s being made of in anaphorlc rules and on the make up of the I structures used.
E89-1040.txt,164,The definition above should merely be regarded as an exemplification of the mechanism.

E89-1020.txt,1,paper proposes a paradigmatic approach to morphological knowledge acquisition. It addresses the problem of learning from examples rules for word forms analysis and synthesis.
E89-1020.txt,2,These rules_comma_ established by generalizing the training data sets_comma_ are effectively used by a built in interpreter which acts consequently as a morphological processor within the architecture of a natural language question answering system.
E89-1020.txt,3,The PARADIGM system has no a priori knowledge which should restrict it to a particular natural language_comma_ but instead builds up the morphological rules based only on the examples provided_comma_ be they in Romanian_comma_ English_comma_ French_comma_ Russian_comma_ SIovak and the like.
E89-1020.txt,5,For highly Inflexlonal languages_comma_ encoding all word forms Into a word lexicon declarative morphology approach appears to be a poor solution not only due to a great redundancy which for some languages is prohibitive Japplnen_comma_t983 but also with respect to some theoretical aspects as for Instance descriptional adequacy Wehrli_comma_1985 .
E89-1020.txt,6,Within an Inflexional morphology environment Alshawl_comma_ t985 _comma_ we propose a procedural approach based on automatically acquired flexlonlng paradigms.
E89-1020.txt,7,The paradigmatic model is Incorporated Into an experimental system called PARADIGM_comma_ which Is Intended to partially replace the acquisition and modelling part of our MORPHO lexicon management system Tufis_comma_1987a incorporated by the lURES environment for building natural language applications Tufts_comma_ 1985 . tioned motivations.
E89-1020.txt,8,With respect to the second one maybe it is worth saying that when PARADIGM lacks appropriate or complete knowledge It is supposed to act the same way a child or a foreign speak partner does.
E89-1020.txt,9,That is_comma_ for instance_comma_ to say goed or womens ff the corresponding irregularity is unknown.
E89-1020.txt,10,The reason for such a decision stems mainly from our attempt to study in parallel with the implementation_comma_ the effectiveness of language learning based on Informal examples.
E89-1020.txt,11,From the linguistic engineering point of view_comma_ the purpose of the system is stated very pragmatically_comma_ that is to ease and speed up as much as possible the building of language specific morphological knowledge bases without too much help from theoretical morphologists_comma_ experts on the language concerned.
E89-1020.txt,12,It is not always easy to find appropriate written material_comma_ not to speak about human experts_comma_ presenting in a rigorous manner as imposed by computer applications the rules and peculiarities of word structuring In different languages.
E89-1020.txt,13,PARADIGM was conceived to overcome_comma_ at least partially_comma_ these difficulties and to provide a handy tool for Immediate verification of specific rules validity.
E89-1020.txt,14,As the general situation is with learning systems_comma_ different copies of PARADIGM may be usecl in parallel and finally merge the Individually developed knowledge bases.
E89-1020.txt,15,This Is beneflclaly not only with respect to the development time but also with respect to the linguistic coverage.
E89-1020.txt,16,Architecturally_comma_ PARADIGM was Influenced by DISCIPLE recuci_comma_ 1988 in the sense that the behavioral dichotomy apprentice expert was Incorporated into Its Implementation.
E89-1020.txt,17,However_comma_ due to the more specific task_comma_ the technical solutions adopted in PARADIGM for knowledge acquisition are different_comma_ being problem oriented.
E89-1020.txt,18,The aim of our work is twofold to obtain a sound linguistic toOl for word forms analysis and synthesis which In case of highly lnflexlonal languages is by no means a trivial task and to provide for a psychologically motivated behaviour of such a system in dealing with unknown words.
E89-1020.txt,19,In the following_comma_ we shall dwell on the technical issues connected to the first of the above two men2.
E89-1020.txt,21,The remainlng part of a word in TF alter removing the root is called an ending we use the term ending to Include both deslnences and suffixes .
E89-1020.txt,22,The list of all endlngs obtained from a TF Is called a paradigmatic endings family PEF .
E89-1020.txt,23,A thematic family is called partial regular if there Is a partition of TF TF1 _comma_TF2 ..... TFk so that 2a lJTFi TF Vl_comma_J l _comma_J TFin TF  2b VI TFi is regular CARD TFI 1 .
E89-1020.txt,24,According to the above definition_comma_ a partial regular TF will be characterized by k roots.
E89-1020.txt,25,A thematic family which is neither regular nor partial regular Is called Irregular.
E89-1020.txt,26,In the following_comma_ in order to simplify notations_comma_ when referring to strings of characters_comma_ we use angular brackets only if we need to outline a composition decomposition of a word form.
E89-1020.txt,27,A central notion of our approach is that of flextoning paradigm.
E89-1020.txt,28,Its meaning is similar to that used by most of the morphologists.
E89-1020.txt,29,We define a flexlonlng paradigm Q as a list of pairs Q  el pl e2 p2 ... ek  where e are endings extracted from a thematic family irrespective of their regularity and pl are appropriate points in P the appropriateness will be revealed in the fourth chapter .

E89-1020.txt,33,Let us observe that I mapping allows a word to be ambiguously interpreted_comma_ which is quite natural at the level of isolated word form analysis.
E89-1020.txt,34,Such a common ambiguity_comma_ for Instance_comma_ is figured out by the Romanlan word modul _comma_ which may stand either for the unarttculated nominative accusative form of modul module or for the articulated nominative accusative form of mod mode_comma_ manner .

E89-1021.txt,2,We concentrate in this paper on speech acts that diverge from the straightforward unfolding of the dialogue.
E89-1021.txt,3,Such speech acts represent dialogue deviations.

E89-1021.txt,31,The above sample dialogue has a quite simple structure presentation of the main sub investment types and collection of information from the user concerning each sub investment.
E89-1021.txt,32,We notice_comma_ however_comma_ that at some points the user does not react directly as the system would expect.
E89-1021.txt,33,For instance_comma_ in sentence 6_comma_ the user is asked about saving money in an emergency fund_comma_ but she wants to talk about buying her ear first.
E89-1021.txt,34,Later_comma_ in sentence 14_comma_ the user is unable to answer a question about the delay of the emergency fund because she does not understand what such a delay is.
E89-1021.txt,35,Such reactions illustrate dialogue deviations.
E89-1021.txt,36,Dialogue deviations are sentences that diverge form the straightforward unfolding of the dialogue_comma_ while having a coherent interpretation with respect to the whole dialogue.
E89-1021.txt,37,These unexpected reactions are inevitable in a dialogue where the participants are independent agents with their own goals and differing degrees of knowledge about each other and the subject under discussion.
E89-1021.txt,38,Before describing our dialogue manager and its mechanism for handling such deviations_comma_ we present in the next section the framework we adopted to model flexible dialogue management.
E89-1021.txt,41,We call 154 these aspects the intentional dimension.
E89-1021.txt,42,Each step in the dialogue concerns a particular topic.
E89-1021.txt,43,Intuitively the notion of topic might be described by a subset of objects of the problem under discussion.
E89-1021.txt,44,In fact_comma_ the boundary of this asubset is not strict one can only say that some objects are more salient than others.
E89-1021.txt,46,It is important to note that in the context of dialogue_comma_ the term deviation is not used with its strict boolean meaning it is a complex and a relative notion.
E89-1021.txt,47,Deviation are complex because they involve both intentional and attentional dimensions.
E89-1021.txt,49,They can be classified according to the type of interactions among of interactions among intentions of the participants and and changes on the focus of attention.
E89-1021.txt,50,The sample session above illustrates several types of such deviations at the communicative level_comma_ the novice user requests for explanations before giving a requested information at the task level_comma_ the user gives an inconsistent value or does not want a given action in the task plan.
E89-1021.txt,51,Deviations are generally combined with changes of sub jets.
E89-1021.txt,52,Within each dimension there exist different degrees of deviations speech acts may have indirect effects_comma_ changes in the focus of attention may be be more or less abrupt_comma_ deviations depend on the expectations each participant has concerning the reactions of the other.
E89-1021.txt,54,The detection and analysis of deviation after a user speech act relies on expectations and predictions in both the intentional and attentional dimensions.
E89-1021.txt,55,The system_comma_ having produced a speech act and waiting for a reaction of the user_comma_ expects in the first place a reaction corresponding exactly to the effect it intended to produce.
E89-1021.txt,56,If the user reacts differently_comma_ the system will use knowledge about possible types of deviation and the state of dialogue to analyze the nature of the deviation.
E89-1021.txt,57,Once a deviation has been identified_comma_ the system may need to modify more or less deeply the planned course of the dialogue from local adaptation like embedding a small clarification subdialogue sentences 14 15 _comma_ to more global revision like reordering entire sub topics sentence 6 .
E89-1021.txt,58,Hence to interpret the influence of an unexpected speech act at a certain point in the dialogue the representation of the state of dialogue should reflect the structure of the whole dialogue keeping track of past exchanges and anticipating the remainder of the dialogue.
E89-1021.txt,60,A Natural Language Front End NLF transforms natural language utterances into literal meaning and vice versa.
E89-1021.txt,61,The literal meaning corresponds to an isolated surface speech act.
E89-1022.txt,1,interpretation of plural anaphora often requires the construction of complex reference objects RefOs out of RefOs which were formerly introduced not by plural terms but by a number of singular terms only. Often_comma_ several complex RefOs can be constructed_comma_ but only one of them is the preferred referent for the plural anaphor in question.
E89-1022.txt,2,As a means of explanation for preferred and non preferred interpretations of plural anaphora_comma_ the concept of a Common Association Basis CAB for the potential atomic parts of a complex object is introduced in the following.
E89-1022.txt,3,CABs pose conceptual constraints on the formation of complex RefOs in general.
E89-1022.txt,4,We argue that in cases where a suitable CAB for the atomic RefOs introduced in the text exists_comma_ the corresponding complex RefO is constructed as early as in the course of processing the antecedent sentence and put into the focus domain of the discourse model.
E89-1022.txt,5,Thus_comma_ the search for a referent for a plural anaphor is constrained to a limited domain of RefOs according to the general principles of focus theory in NLP.
E89-1022.txt,6,Further principles of interpretation are suggested which guide the resolution of plural anaphora in cases where more than one suitable complex RefO is in focus. The research on this paper was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG under grant Ha 1237 2 1.
E89-1022.txt,7,GAP is the acronym for Gruppierungs und Abgrenzungsgrozesse beim Aufbau sprachlich angeregter mentaler Modelle Processes of grouping and separation in the construction of mental models from texts _comma_ a research project carried out in the DFG program Kognitive Linguistik .
E89-1022.txt,9,Most approaches to processing anaphora concern themselves mainly with the case of singulars and deal only peripherally with the complications of plurals.
E89-1022.txt,10,An analysis of plural anaphora should answer the following additional questions 1 How are the referents of plural terms represented by discourse entities internal proxies
E89-1022.txt,11,2 How is the link between plural anaphora and suitable antecedent discourse entities established
E89-1022.txt,12,3 How are complex discourse entities constructed from atomic ones
E89-1022.txt,13,4 When are complex discourse entities constructed in the process of text comprehension
E89-1022.txt,14,The present paper addresses primarily the third and fourth questions.
E89-1022.txt,15,However_comma_ we will give some sketchy answers to the first and second questions as well.
E89-1022.txt,16,We consider only two sentence texts in which the second sentence contains an anaphoric pronoun that refers to entities introduced in the first sentence by various constructions 1 a.
E89-1022.txt,17,The children were at the cinema.
E89-1022.txt,18,They had a great time. b.
E89-1022.txt,19,Michael and Maria were at the cinema.
E89-1022.txt,20,They had a great time.
E89-1022.txt,22,Michael was at the cinema with Maria.
E89-1022.txt,23,They had a great time. d.
E89-1022.txt,24,Michael met Maria at the cinema.
E89-1022.txt,25,They had a great time.
E89-1022.txt,26,The question is To which entities_comma_ i.e. complex discourse entities_comma_ does the plural anaphor th_h refer
E89-1022.txt,27,Surely in 1.a to the one corresponding to the children_comma_ and in 1.b _comma_ 1.c and 1.d to Michael and Maria.
E89-1022.txt,28,Up to now_comma_ most analyses of plural anaphora 161investigate cases of the 1.a or 1.b type_comma_ i.e. those in which the complex object is introduced explicitly_comma_ either by a simple plural NP or by a conjunction of singular or plural NPs which in both cases yields a plural NP as well .
E89-1022.txt,30,A SKETCH ON PLURALITY We assume as is common in most recent approaches to anaphora in AI and linguistic semantics e.g. Webber 1979_comma_ Kamp 1984 a representation level of discourse referents_comma_ which are internal proxies of objects of the real or a possible or fictional world.
E89-1022.txt,31,These discourse entities_comma_ called reference objects RefOs _comma_ are stored and processed in a net like structure_comma_ called a referential net RefN _comma_ which links RefOs and designations.
E89-1022.txt,32,For a detailed description see Habel 1982_comma_ 1986a_comma_ 1986b and Eschenbach 1988. The term RefO is_comma_ when strictly used_comma_ a technical notion which is employed in the framework of our formalism only.
E89-1022.txt,33,For reasons of simplicity of exposition_comma_ we do not want to restrict the use of RefO to this formalism in the present paper_comma_ but rather apply the term to referents also_comma_ i.e. the objects to which names_comma_ descriptions and pronouns refer.
E89-1022.txt,34,RefOs for complex objects are constructed by means of a sum operation Link 1983 _comma_ so that with respect to 1.b _comma_ we have the following entries among others in the RefN. rl Michael r2 Maria r3 rl r2 The sum operation symbolized by is the semantic counterpart of the NP connective and.
E89-1022.txt,35,It defines a semi lattice Link 1983_comma_ Eschenbach 1988 .
E89-1022.txt,36,By means of this structure_comma_ both complex and atomic RefOs can be seen as objects of the same logical type and are accessible by the same set of referential processes.
E89-1022.txt,37,No operations on RefOs other than the sum operation will be considered in the present context.
E89-1022.txt,39,CONSTRAINTS ON SUM FORMATION Sentences like 1.a and 1.b demonstrate that complex discourse referents can be created by plural NPs.
E89-1022.txt,40,But there are other linguistic indicators for the creation of complex RefOs.1 The anaphoric pronoun they of 1.c and 1.d as well as 1.b refers to a corresponding complex RefO.
E89-1022.txt,41,It is obvious that besides conjunctions e.g. and _comma_ some prepositions and verbs trigger processes of sum formation with PPs and meet are outstanding examples of these types of constructions. In 1.c _comma_ Michael ... with Maria triggers the formation of Michael Mafia.
E89-1022.txt,42,But consider the following texts 2 a.
E89-1022.txt,43,Michael and Mafia were at the park with Peter.
E89-1022.txt,44,In the evening they were at a garden party. b.
E89-1022.txt,45,Michael and Mafia were at the park with their frisbee.
E89-1022.txt,46,In the evening they were at a garden party.
E89-1022.txt,47,In 2.a it is possible that they refers to Michael Maria Peter.
E89-1022.txt,48,But in 2.b they is preferably linked to Michael Maria even if Michael and Mafia happened to take their frisbee to the garden party_comma_ we would not want to claim that the plural anaphor they in 2.b refers to a complex discourse entity consisting of Michael_comma_ Mafia and the frisbee.
E89-1022.txt,49,In the preferred reading 6f 2.b _comma_ the frisbee is excluded from the antecedent of the anaphor.
E89-1022.txt,50,We have to explain why with PPs only cause sum formation in certain cases.
E89-1022.txt,51,The proposed solution to this problem is the concept of a Common Association Basis CAB _comma_ which is introduced in Herweg 1988 .
E89-1022.txt,52,The CAB is an extension of the Common Integrator CI _comma_ which Lang 1984 developed in his general theory of coordinate conjunction structures.
E89-1022.txt,53,1 The assumption of indicators and constraints contrasts to the less restrictive assumption of Frey Kamp s 1986 DRToriented analysis of plural anaphora_comma_ in which they claim that any collection of available reference markers_comma_ whether singular or plural_comma_ can be joined together to yield the antecedent with which the pronoun can be connected p. 18 .
E89-1022.txt,54,162 Grouping by with depends on the condition that x with y leads to x y only in those cases in which a CAB relation is fulfilled.
E89-1022.txt,55,The most relevant constraint given by CAB is the condition that x and y are instances of the same ontological type at the most fine grained level.
E89-1022.txt,56,This means two humans are good candidates to form a complex RefO_comma_ whereas a frisbee_comma_ which does not fall under the ontological type of humans or animate objects_comma_ and the human players are not.
E89-1022.txt,57,CAB constraints apply not only to cases like 1.c and 2.b _comma_ but to sum formation in general.
E89-1022.txt,58,Consider this example 3 Michael and his frisbee were at the park.
E89-1022.txt,59,Here the conjunction explicitly forces the sum formation of objects of different ontological types.
E89-1022.txt,60,This is at least unusual and has a strange effect.
E89-1022.txt,61,However_comma_ explicit conjunction by nd presupposes the existence of a suitable CAB for the conjoined entities.
E89-1022.txt,62,The addressee must assume that the conjunction in 3 involves an instruction to derive such a CAB or simply concede that one exists .
E89-1022.txt,63,Thus_comma_ to make conjunctions like the one in 3 acceptable and natural_comma_ one normally has to assume a CAB which is not explicitly specified or immedeatly derivable from the information conveyed in the sentence itself but which is given by the preceding or extralinguistic context.
E89-1022.txt,64,In 3 _comma_ the required CAB might simply be something like the entities desperately being looked for by Michael s children .
E89-1022.txt,65,In isolation however_comma_ forced sum formations like the one in 3 must be considered marginally acceptable.
E89-1022.txt,66,We now have the following situation Grouping depends on properties of the RefOs in question_comma_ namely whether a CAB exists which constitutes a conceptual relation among the RefOs with respect to situational parameters given_comma_ for example_comma_ by predicative concepts.
E89-1022.txt,67,Furthermore_comma_ it is obvious that world knowledge and the theme of the discourse give evidence for which complex RefO is most appropriate as the antecedent of an anaphoric pronoun.
E89-1022.txt,68,We will propose that these factors can be handled by CABs as well.
E89-1022.txt,69,This leads us to Herweg s 1988 Principle of Connectedness All sub RefOs of a complex RefO must be related by a CAB.
E89-1022.txt,70,Now consider example 1.d .
E89-1022.txt,71,It shows that some lexical concepts possess what we call grouping force_comma_ i.e. they trigger sum formation with respect to atomic RefOs.
E89-1022.txt,72,The grouping force of a lexical concept can be seen as a special case of a CAB.
E89-1022.txt,73,Without going into details of the representation formalism we can formulate the relevant sum formation processes by this rule If x meets y _comma_ then construct the complex RefO x y.
E89-1022.txt,74,The status of this sum formation rule is similar to that of classical inference rules_comma_ which are used for bridging processes in the sense of Clark 1975 .
E89-1022.txt,75,Not all verbs possess a grouping force as strong as meet e.g. the grouping force of watch is considerably lower.
E89-1022.txt,76,Consider 4 a.
E89-1022.txt,77,Michael met Peter and Maria in the pub.
E89-1022.txt,78,They had a great time. b.
E89-1022.txt,79,Michael watched Peter and Maria in the pub.
E89-1022.txt,80,They had a great time.
E89-1022.txt,81,In 4.b _comma_ the sum of Maria and Peter is significantly preferred to the sum including Michael as the antecedent of they.
E89-1022.txt,82,In 4.a _comma_ there presumably is a preference to the opposite_comma_ i.e. to link they to the sum consisting of all three persons.
E89-1022.txt,83,In contrast to highly associative verbal concepts like meet_comma_ watch must be classified as a dissociative element which does not constitute a CAB for its arguments but induces a conceptual separation.
E89-1022.txt,84,Part of the explanation for this property of watch is to be seen in the normally understood local separation of subject and object in the situation described.
E89-1022.txt,85,Again in contrast to meet_comma_ this local separation usually prevents an interaction or some other kind of contact which allows one to assume a suitable link i.e. a CAB for the persons introduced based on properties of the situation which the sentence describes.
E89-1022.txt,87,ANAPHORA RESOLUTION AS A SEARCH PROCESS
E89-1022.txt,88,Many classical approaches to anaphora resolution are based on search processes.
E89-1022.txt,89,163 Given an anaphor_comma_ a set of explicitly introduced referents is searched for the best choice.
E89-1022.txt,90,2 The crucial point is How to determine the set of possible antecedents The most simple solution is the history list of all referents mentioned in the last several sentences Allen 1987_comma_ p. 343 .
E89-1022.txt,91,Note that most DRT based anaphora resolution processes Kamp 1984_comma_ Frey Kamp 1986 by and large follow this line_comma_ with a few modifications concerning structural conditions in terms of an accessibility relation.
E89-1022.txt,92,But there is also a different perspective whose key notion is the well established concept of focus see e.g. in Computational Linguistics Grosz Sidner 1986 3.
E89-1022.txt,93,As is shown by psychological experiments an detailed overview is given by Guindon 1985 _comma_ a very limited number of discourse referents are focussed.
E89-1022.txt,94,Referents in the focus_comma_ which can be described in psychological terms as short term memory see Guindon _comma_ are quickly accessed especially pronouns are normally used to refer to items in the focus and therefore extensive search is mostly unnecessary.
E89-1022.txt,95,The most relevant question with respect to focus is Which items are currently in the focus
E89-1022.txt,97,Answers 2 Note that the unspecifity of pronouns seldom allows the triggering of bridging inferences see Clark 1975 to select referents which are only implicitly introduced.
E89-1022.txt,99,Bosch 1987 and Allen 1987 chap. 14 .
E89-1022.txt,100,Both give convincing arguments against the simplistic view of identifying anaphora resolution with searching.
E89-1022.txt,101,Since we address matters of pronominal anaphora only_comma_ we here assume a rather simple concept of focus.
E89-1022.txt,102,Further differentiations e.g. Garrod Sanford s 1982 division of focus into an explicit and implicit component which might become necessary if non pronominal anaphora are investigated as well are out of the scope of the present paper.
E89-1022.txt,103,4 A question closely related to this_comma_ namely at which point of time and in what to this question determine which referents can be antecedents of pronouns.
E89-1022.txt,105,PLURALS IN FOCUS Following the line of argumentation in section 4_comma_ the possibility of a reference to a complex RefO with a plural pronoun as in 1 means that such a complex RefO is in the focus after processing the first sentence.
E89-1022.txt,106,Thus it is worth taking a closer look at the question as to when a complex RefO is formed.
E89-1022.txt,107,There are essentially two opportunities to construct a complex RefO from atomic RefOs it can be constructed and put into the focus when the atomic RefOs are mentioned_comma_ or the construction might be suspended until an anaphor triggers the sum formation.
E89-1022.txt,108,5 The second solution has some undesirable consequences the worst is that the methods of resolving plural anaphora and singular anaphora must be completely different.
E89-1022.txt,109,Since the complex RefOs would not be in the focus_comma_ a direct access to the focussed entities could not solve the problem.
E89-1022.txt,110,In such cases_comma_ the construction process would be triggered during anaphora resolution.
E89-1022.txt,111,Thus the processing of they with respect to Michael ... with Maria in 1.c and Michael met Maria in 1.d should be more complicated than the cases of the children or Michael and Maria_comma_ an assumption for which no evidence exists as yet.
E89-1022.txt,112,Therefore_comma_ we take the former choice of constructing the complex RefO while processing the atomic RefOs.
E89-1022.txt,113,Again_comma_ this suggests two possibilities_comma_ namely to construct the complex RefO and put only this into the focus_comma_ or to introduce both the complex and the atomic RefOs into the focus.
E89-1022.txt,114,As a working hypothesis_comma_ we propose the latter procedure_comma_ since the sentences like 5 _comma_ way the focus is updated_comma_ is not relevant as long as we confine ourselves to texts containing only two sentences.
E89-1022.txt,115,However_comma_ it becomes important when the analysis is expanded to multiple sentence texts.
E89-1022.txt,116,5 This distinction corresponds to Charniak s 1976 p. 11 well known dichotomy of read time and question time inferences.
E89-1022.txt,117,164which contain singular anaphora cf. 1 _comma_ are fully coherent 5 a.
E89-1022.txt,118,Michael and Mafia were at the cinema.
E89-1022.txt,119,He She had a great time. b.
E89-1022.txt,120,Maria was at the cinema with Michael.
E89-1022.txt,121,He She had a great time.
E89-1022.txt,123,Michael met Mafia at the cinema.
E89-1022.txt,124,He She had a great time.
E89-1022.txt,125,That these findings do not depend on linguistic introspection only is established by processing time experiments_comma_ which are reported in Mtisseler Rickheit 1989 .
E89-1022.txt,126,6 The initial results of the experiments suggest that the complexities of processing singular or plural anaphora of sentences like 1 vs. 5 are not significantly different 7.
E89-1022.txt,127,The anaphoric accessibility of the complex RefOs which are introduced by the sentences listed above is by no means worse than the accessibilty of the atomic RefOs.
E89-1022.txt,128,Let us summarize the discussion so far There are linguistic concepts such as conjunctions_comma_ prepositions and lexical concepts which trigger the construction of complex RefOs.
E89-1022.txt,129,The atomic RefOs as well as the complex RefO which is formed by 6 Mtisseler s and Rickheit s research at the University of Bielefeld is also carded out in a project in the DFG Program Kognitive Linguistik . This project collaborates with ours on reference phenomena from computational and psycholinguistic points of view. 7 This holds at least for cases where the antecedent of the singular anaphor is in subject topic position. Questions concerning the accessibility of singular antecedents in non subject non topic positions are not definitely settled as yet see Mtisseler Rickheit 1989 .
E89-1022.txt,130,Since Mtisseler s and Rickheit s experiments are confined to German_comma_ which has a single form ie for 3rd pl. pronoun they and 3rd sg. fern. pronoun she _comma_ not all of their results on the processing time of singular anaphora with antecedents in different structural positions can be applied to English. the sum operation are introduced into the focus.
E89-1022.txt,131,Thus_comma_ resolution of anaphora can be performed by processes on the focus not involving extensive search.
E89-1022.txt,133,FURTHER PRINCIPLES OF ANAPHORA RESOLUTION Further interesting problems can be observed in the interaction of concepts which possess grouping capacity.
E89-1022.txt,134,Consider 6 a.
E89-1022.txt,135,Michael and Maria picked up Peter and Anne from the station.
E89-1022.txt,136,They were happy to see each other again. b.
E89-1022.txt,137,Michael and Mafia picked up Peter and Anne from the station.
E89-1022.txt,138,They were late.
E89-1022.txt,139,Here the following atomic and complex RefOs exist rl Michael r2 Maria r3 Peter r4 Anne r5 rl r2 r6 r3 r4 r7 r5 r6 rl r2 r3 r4 In the preferred interpretation_comma_ they in 6.a refers to r7_comma_ in 6.b either to r5 or r6.
E89-1022.txt,140,It follows from this analysis that more than one complex RefO can be in focus.
E89-1022.txt,141,Which one is the most appropriate to link to the pronoun depends on two principles see Herweg 1988 Principle of Permanence It is prohibited unless the text explicitly requires it to link the plural pronoun to a proper sub RefO of a complex RefO in focus.
E89-1022.txt,142,Reference to a sub RefO is only possible if it was introduced explicitly into the discourse model by a previous inference.
E89-1022.txt,143,Principle of Maximality The plural anaphoric pronoun should be linked to the maximal sum of appropriate RefOs with respect to a suitable CAB_comma_ unless the text contains explicit evidence to the contrary.
E89-1022.txt,144,The interaction of the principles of Connectedness_comma_ Permanence and Maximality can lead to correct and natural anaphora resolution in 6 .
E89-1022.txt,145,For 6.a _comma_ maximality and per 165 manence require a maximal sum_comma_ which is rT in 6.b _comma_ knowledge about the situations of picking someone up and being late excludes r7 i.e. no CAB can be established which is simultaneously satisfied by all atomic parts of r7 therefore_comma_ the condition of connectedness is not fulfilled and thus gives evidence for a sub RefO_comma_ namely either r5 or r6.
E89-1022.txt,146,The principle of Permanence excludes other combinations of atomic RefOs_comma_ such as rl r3_comma_ r2 r3_comma_ etc. Whether r5 or r6 is chosen at last can not be decided on the basis of the above mentioned principles alone.
E89-1022.txt,147,These examples show that a conflict resolution strategy is needed_comma_ as is not unusual for such principles.
E89-1022.txt,149,IMPLEMENTATION The RefN processes and sum formation are currently being implemented in QuintusPROLOG on a MicroVax workstation.
E89-1022.txt,150,The present implementation allows one to represent and create RefOs and 1 their descriptions by way of designators internal proxies for names and definite NPs _comma_ 2 their descriptions by way of attributes_comma_ which specify properties sorts of the represented objects themselves not their designations and relations between them.
E89-1022.txt,151,E.g. sums are represented by the use of attributes to RefOs.
E89-1022.txt,152,The set of RefOs with their descriptions can be structured_comma_ so that different RefNs_comma_ whether or not they are independent from each other or related by shared RefOs_comma_ may be represented in parallel.
E89-1022.txt,153,The representation of a sample text within the formalism is being worked.
E89-1022.txt,154,The transfer of segments of the text into simple nets is not being done automatically but by hand.
E89-1022.txt,155,For each anaphor_comma_ a corresponding RefO is created but specially marked as an anaphoric RefO.
E89-1022.txt,156,This is intended to trigger the automatic resolution of anaphora.
E89-1022.txt,157,In the near future_comma_ it is planned to determine the potential antecedent referents for an anaphor out of the set of all RefOs which are available define the requirements concerning the representation of focus it is planned to test different formats of representation structure the nets in order to represent CABs.
E89-1022.txt,158,The function of the last two steps mentioned is to put further restrictions on the set of potential antecedent referents for a given anaphor.
E89-1022.txt,160,SUMMARY Compared to the case of singular pronouns_comma_ the resolution of anaphoric plural pronouns requires an additional step of processing the sum formation.
E89-1022.txt,161,It is guided by various grammatical and lexical evidence_comma_ which is accumulated to form a common association basis CAB .
E89-1022.txt,162,The principle of connectedness controls the sum formation_comma_ by which the restriction to a very limited number of complex RefOs is possible.
E89-1022.txt,163,The role of focus with respect to plural anaphora is similar to the singular case_comma_ but poses the question as to when the sum formation is carried out in the process of text comprehension.
E89-1022.txt,164,The resolution processes of the singular and plural cases can be made identical by assuming that_comma_ in cases where a suitable CAB is available_comma_ the sum formation takes place early_comma_ i.e. while processing the antecedent sentence s .
E89-1022.txt,165,The principles of Permanence and Maximality are two principles which are valid especially for plural anaphora.
E89-1022.txt,166,The use of CABs and the mentioned principles of sum formation is a way to avoid the inadequacies of prior approaches to plural anaphora_comma_ which mostly seem to follow the motto Anything goes .
E89-1022.txt,167,ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Ewald Lang_comma_ Geoff Simmons who also corrected our English and Andrea Schopp for stimulating discussions and three anonymous referees from ACL for their comments on an earlier version of this paper. .
E89-1028.txt,1,the formalisms normally used for describing the semantics of natural languages are far from computationally tractable_comma_ it is possible to isolate particular semantic phenomena and interpret them within simpler formal systems. Quantified mass noun phrases is one such part.
E89-1028.txt,2,We describe a simple formal system suitable for the interpretation of quantified mass noun phrases.
E89-1028.txt,3,The main issue of this paper is to develop an algorithm for deciding the validity of sentences in the formal system and hence for deciding the validity of natural language inferences where all the involved noun phrases are quantified mass noun phrases.
E89-1028.txt,4,The decision procedure is based on a tableau calculus. .
E89-1028.txt,5,A formal semantics for a part of a natural language attempts to describe the truth conditions for sentences_comma_ or propositions expressed by sentences_comma_ in model theoretic terms_comma_ and thereby also the relation of valid inferences between sentences.
E89-1028.txt,6,From the point of view of computational linguistics and natural language understanding_comma_ it is important whether this relation of entailment can be made computational.
E89-1028.txt,7,In general_comma_ the question must be answered in the negative.
E89-1028.txt,14,The propositional part is classical.
E89-1028.txt,16,However_comma_ one shall not take this picture too literally since the model works as well for .
E89-1015.txt,1,this paper we discuss an algorithm for the assignment of pitch accent positions in text to speech conversion. The algorithm is closely modeled on current linoulstic accounts of accent placement_comma_ and assumes a surface syntactic analysis of the input.
E89-1015.txt,2,It comprises a small number of heuristic rules for determining which phrases of a sentence are to be focussed upon the exact location of a pitch accent within a focussed phrase is determined m inly on the basis of the syntactic relations holding between the elements of the phrase.
E89-1015.txt,3,A perceptual evaluation experiment showed that the algorithm proposed here leads to improved subjective speech quality as compared to a naive algorithm which accents all and only content words.
E89-1015.txt,5,This paper deals with the prosodic component of a text to speech system for Dutch_comma_ more in particular with the rules for assigning pitch accents sentence accents to words in an input sentence.
E89-1015.txt,6,Whereas other work on accent rules for Dutch speech synthesis Kager Quen6_comma_ 1987 did not assume a syntactically analysed input_comma_ I will here work from the assumption that the text to speech system has a large dictionary as well as a syntactic parser at its disposal.
E89-1015.txt,7,The paper is organized as follows in section 2 I shortly introduce the notions focus and pitch accent as I will be using them as my framework_comma_ I will choose the Eindhoven model of Dutch intonation Ct Hart Cohen_comma_ 1973 t Hart Collier_comma_ 1975 in conjunction with Gussenhoven s 1983 accent placement theory.
E89-1015.txt,8,In section 3 I discuss the rules that connect a domain of focus to an accent on a particular word.
E89-1015.txt,9,The assi mment of focus domMn is dealt with in section 4.
E89-1015.txt,10,At the end of this section I s mrn O my proposals in the form of an accent assignment algorithm In section 5 I present some results obtained in a perceptual evaluation of this algorithm.
E89-1015.txt,12,A two stage model of accent placement Work on Dutch intonation at the Institute for Perception Research IPO in Eindhoven has resulted in an inventory of elementary pitch movements that make up the occurring Dutch intonation contours t Hart Cohen_comma_ 1973 t Hart Comer_comma_ 1975 .
E89-1015.txt,13,The phonetic characteristics of these pitch movements are known precisely_comma_ and this knowledge can be used in the synthesis of natural sounding Dutch intonation contours.
E89-1015.txt,14,It was found that some of these elementary pitch movements cause the syllable on which they are executed to be perceived as accented.
E89-1015.txt,15,I will use the term pitch accent or simply accent to refer to prominence caused by the presence of such an accent lending pitch movement.
E89-1015.txt,16,Of course_comma_ the intonation model does not predict where in a sentence pitch accents or intonational boundaries will be located_comma_ but when these locations are provided as input_comma_ the model is capable of generating a natural sounding contour.
E89-1015.txt,17,In the remainder of this paper I will deal specifically with pitch accent assiLmment.
E89-1015.txt,18,It is relatively standard nowadays to view accent phcement as a process involving two stages of. Ladd_comma_ 1980 Gussenhoven_comma_ 1983 Fuchs_comma_ 1984 Baart_comma_ 1987 in the first stage it is decided which constituents of a sentence contain relatively important information e.g. because they add new information to the background shared by speaker and hearer and are therefore to be focussed upon the decision to focus certain parts of a sentence and not focus other parts is based on semanticopragmatic information and in principle cannot be predicted from the lexico syntactic structure of a sentence.
E89-1015.txt,19,In the second stage_comma_ the exact location of a pitch accent within a focussed constituent is determined here lexico syntactic structure does play a crucial role.
E89-1015.txt,20,The following example_comma_ cited from Ladd 1980 _comma_ illustrates these ideas.
E89-1015.txt,22,Given the speaker s decision to focus on the subject_comma_ an accent is placed by rule on the last lexical element within this constituent.
E89-1015.txt,23,In the following sections_comma_ I first discuss the rules that place an accent within a focussed constituent in Dutch_comma_ and next turn to the problem of assigning focus to the constituents of a sentence.
E89-1015.txt,25,From focus to accent As will be clear from the paragraphs above_comma_ I assume that accent placement is predictable if the focussing structure of a sentence is known for discussion see Gussenhoven et al._comma_ 1987 Baart_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1015.txt,26,I adopt Gussenhoven s 1983 idea that accent placement is sensitive to the argument structure of a sentence however_comma_ I replace his semantic orientation by a syntactic one and apply the term argument to any constituent which is selected by the subcategorization frame of some lexical head_comma_ indudln subjects.
E89-1015.txt,28,In order to arrive at an accentuation pattern_comma_ three rules and a well formedness condition are to be applied to this input.
E89-1015.txt,29,A first rule see 2 applies iteratively to pairs of sister nodes in the input tree_comma_ replacing the syntactic labels with the labels s for strong or w for weak _comma_ familiar from metrical phonology.
E89-1015.txt,33,In 3 I illustrate the operation of the BLR.
E89-1015.txt,34,All left hand sisters in 3 are labelled w_comma_ except for the NP een mooi boek_comma_ which is an argument.
E89-1015.txt,36,3 ik heb een mooi BOEK gekocht I have a nice book bought s heb ....L.. w w s gek cht oen W S . t moot boek The output of the BLR may be modified by two additional rules.
E89-1015.txt,37,First_comma_ the Rhythm Rule accounts for cases of rhythmical accent shift_comma_ see 4 .
E89-1015.txt,38,4 Rhythm Rule RR_comma_ applies to the output of the BLR A w.... s W S  C  C w h A B A B Conditions a C is dominated by a focus Co B and C are string adjacent c A is not a pronoun_comma_ article_comma_ preposition or conjunction In 5 _comma_ where we assume focus on both the main verb and the time adverbial_comma_ the accent pattern on the adverbial has been modified by the 1111 the accent which is normally reali7egi on nacht has been shifted to hele .
E89-1015.txt,44,As a result of the DA rule_comma_ it is the particle op that receives the accent in Tb _comma_ instead of the object.
E89-1015.txt,46,It has been noted by Gussenhoven 1983 that an unaccented verb may not be part of a focus domain if it is directly preceded by an accented adjunct.
E89-1015.txt,47,For instance_comma_ in 8a 8a in ZEIST is een FABRIEK verwoest in Zeist is a factory destroyed the verb verwoest is unaccented.
E89-1015.txt,48,There is no problem here the VP as a whole is in focus_comma_ due to the accent on the argument een fabdek.
E89-1015.txt,49,Consider_comma_ however_comma_ Sb Sb in ZEIST is een FABRIEK door BRAND verwoest in Zeist is a factory by fire destroyed This is a somewhat strange sentence.
E89-1015.txt,50,The accent on door BRAND arouses an impression of contrast and the verb vetwoest is out of focus.
E89-1015.txt,52,W S S W ace ace ace ace The PMC states that within a focus domain a weak 14 constituent such as door brand in 8b_comma_c may not be accented if its strong s sister such as vetwoest in 8b_comma_c is unaccented.
E89-1015.txt,54,Assigning focus Assnrnln that a programme for semantic interpretation of unrestricted Dutch text will not be available within the near future_comma_ the following practical strategy is proposed for assic_comma_ ning focus to constituents in a syntactic tree.
E89-1015.txt,55,This strategy is based on the insight that word classes differ with respect to the amount of information that is typically conveyed by their members.
E89-1015.txt,60,2 Assign the labels w and s to nodes in the tree_comma_ according to the BLR above.
E89-1015.txt,63,5 Apply the RR_comma_ starting out from the most deeply embedded subtrees.
E89-1015.txt,71,Perceptual evaluation The accent assi ment algorithm has been implemented as a Pascal programme.
E89-1015.txt,72,Input to this programme is a Dutch sentence the user is asked to provide information about syntactic bracketing and labelling_comma_ and about the argument status of constituents.
E89-1015.txt,73,The programme next assigns focus structure and w s labelling to the sentence and outputs the predicted accent pattern.
E89-1015.txt,74,A small informative text was used for evaluation of the output of the programme.
E89-1015.txt,75,In this evaluation experiment_comma_ the predicted accent patterns were compared with the accent patterns spontaneously produced by a human reader_comma_ as well as with the accent patterns as predicted by a naive accentuation algorithm which assigns an accent to every content word.
E89-1015.txt,76,Listeners were asked to rate the quality of sentences synthesized with the respective accent patterns on a 7 point scale.
E89-1015.txt,77,As a snmmary of the results_comma_ I here present the mean scores for each of the conditions Spontaneous accentuatiom 5.2 Sophisticated algorithm 4.6 Naive algorithm 3.3 As one can see_comma_ human accentuation is stili preferred over the output of the algorithm of section 4.
E89-1015.txt,78,Of course this is what we expect_comma_ as the algorithm does not have access to the semantico pragmatic properties of an input text_comma_ such as coreferenco and contrast.
E89-1015.txt,79,On the other hand we see that the algorithm_comma_ which does take syntactic effects on accent placement into account_comma_ offers a substantial improvement over a simple algorithm based on the content word function word distinction. .
E89-1035.txt,1,_comma_ 10_comma_000 naturally occurring noun phrases taken from the LOB corpus were used firstly_comma_ to evaluate the NP component of the Alvey ANLT grammar Grover et al._comma_ 1987_comma_ 1989 and secondly_comma_ to retest Sampson s 1987a claim that this data provide evidence for the lack of a clear cut distinction between grammatical and deviant examples. The examples were sorted and classified on the basis of the lexical and syntactic analysis undertaken as part of the LOB corpus project Sampson_comma_ 1987b .
E89-1035.txt,2,Tokens of each resulting type were parsed using the ANLT grammar and the results analysed to determine the success rate of the parses and the generality of the rules employed. .
E89-1035.txt,3,In this paper_comma_ we present the results of an analysis of just over 10_comma_000 English noun phrases NPs extracted from the Lancaster Oslo Bergen LOB corpus treebank Sampson_comma_ 1987b _comma_ a syntactically analysed 50_comma_000 word subset of the 1 million word LOB corpus.
E89-1035.txt,4,The motivation for this research is twofold.
E89-1035.txt,5,Firstly_comma_ we wish to use this substantial data base of naturally occurring constructions to test the accuracy mad adequacy of a purportedly wide coverage sentence grammar Grover et al._comma_ 1987_comma_ 1989 which has been developed over the past three years as part of a general purpose morphological and syntactic analyser for English hereafter the Alvey Natural Language Tools ANLT grammar .
E89-1035.txt,6,2 The research reported here forms part of an ongoing project to evaluate the complete grammar using data extracted from the LOB corpus see Briscoe et al._comma_ 1987a .
E89-1035.txt,7,Secondly_comma_ Sampson 1987a has analysed a large subset of the same NPs and argued that they provide evidence against any clear cut distinction between grammatical and deviant sentences in natural language.
E89-1035.txt,8,Sampson suggests that the lack of such a distinction precludes the possibility of successful automated natural language processing NLP using a generative grammar.
E89-1035.txt,9,If correct_comma_ this conclusion would have profound implications for our own work and the majority of other work in NLP since the ANLT grammar is a type of generative grammar .
E89-1035.txt,10,Therefore_comma_ we wished to assess the evidence which Sampson uses to sutrtx his conclusion.
E89-1035.txt,11,The LOB treebank is a manually analysed set of sentences drawn from the lexically analysed and tagged LOB corpus. An analysis consists of a labelled bracketing containing lexical syntactic tags and phrasal or clausal hypertags .
E89-1035.txt,12,Sampson 1987_comma_ 221 reports that there are 47 tags and hypertags relevant to the analysis of NPs 28 lexical tags_comma_ 14 hypertags and 5 punctuation tags Analyses are assigned to sentences according to the intuitions of the linguist guided by a casebook of precedents Sampson_comma_ 1987b .
E89-1035.txt,13,One important feature of these analyses is that the resulting tree structures are quite shallow in the sense that there are rarely intervening nodes between the topmost node marked NP and the lexical tags themselves.
E89-1035.txt,14,Whilst most NP postmodifiers are treated as independent constituents_comma_ NP premodifiers are largely analysed as immediate daughters of the topmost NP node.
E89-1035.txt,15,In addition_comma_ punctuation tags are usually attached as immediate daughters of this node.
E89-1035.txt,16,A second significant feature of the LOB treebank analysis scheme is that tags and hypertags are atomic symbols albeit with mnemonic names designed to indicate aspects of their featural composition .
E89-1035.txt,17,Sampson 1987a 221 treats these 47 tags and hypertags as defining the types of distinct NP two or more noun phrases are regarded as tokens of the same type if their respective immediate constituents ICs represent the same sequence of possibilities drawn from this 47 member set of constituent types .
E89-1035.txt,18,The example he gives of an NP type is DT S _comma_ F which would be the analysis assigned to an NP consisting of a determiner_comma_ plural noun_comma_ comma and finite clause.
E89-1035.txt,19,In this example_comma_ Sampson has generalised across sets of atomic tags through the use of wildcard symbols_comma_ so DT generalises across DTI_comma_ DT _comma_ DTS_comma_ DTX_comma_ and so forth.
E89-1035.txt,20,He does not explain the extent to which he has generalised types in this fashion however_comma_ since hyper tags contain at most four letters representing distinct features there are strict limits on featural decomposition within this framework of analysis.
E89-1035.txt,21,Sampson found that the 8328 NP tokens in his sample fell into 747 distinct NP types relative to the notion of type just described .
E89-1035.txt,22,However_comma_ the crucial point of his argument is that the distribution of tokens amongst types is very wide.
E89-1035.txt,23,Sampson finds that there are a few very common types such as 1135 tokens of DT N ie. determiner followed by noun and a large number of distinct types with very few tokens such as 468 types represented by a single token .
E89-1035.txt,24,Sampson examines the shape of the constituent type token curve which results from analysing each type frequency relative to the most frequent type in the corpus.
E89-1035.txt,25,Sampson 1987a 225 concludes that this analysis provides no evidence at all of a two way partition of noun phrase types into a group of high frequency_comma_ well formed constructions and a group of unique or rare deviant constructions instead noun phrase types in the sample appear to be scattered continuously across the frequency spectrum. Furthermore_comma_ he suggests that the evidence from NPs supports his claim that the range of constructions occurring in authentic texts seems so endlessly diverse 256 that the enterprise of formulating watertight generative grammars appears doomed to failure 1987b 219 .
E89-1035.txt,26,The last step in Sampson s argument from the distribution of tokens amongst NP types to the failure of the generative paradigm is not made completely explicit.
E89-1035.txt,27,However_comma_ we believe that a legitimate way of reconstructing it is as follows.
E89-1035.txt,28,Suppose that we convert each NP type as defined above into a phrase structure rule of a generative grammar so DT S _comma_ F becomes NP DT S_comma_ F and so forth .
E89-1035.txt,29,Now consider the form that such a grammar will take there will be a small number of quite general rules which will be used frequently and a very large number of particular rules used very infrequently.
E89-1035.txt,30,Crucially_comma_ for any corpus considered_comma_ many of the particular rules will be motivated by just one token in the data.
E89-1035.txt,31,Thus_comma_ these rules are not rules in any genuine sense since they express no generalisations over the data.
E89-1035.txt,32,Furthermore_comma_ this suggests that the task of the generative linguist in search of watertight grammars will never be complete because each new set of data will bring with it the need for further highly idiosyncratic rules of this kind.
E89-1035.txt,33,Whilst it seems likely that all grammars leak slightly_comma_ one clear problem with Sampson s argument is that his evidence only bears on one particular and implausible generative grammar_comma_ rather than on the paradigm as a whole.
E89-1035.txt,34,It may well be that the generalisations which can be expressed in terms of a phrase structure grammar employing a finite set of nearly atomic categories are not those appropriate to elegant description of natural language syntax Chomsky_comma_ 1957 Gazdar et al._comma_ 1985 .
E89-1035.txt,35,In addition_comma_ the strategy of adopting shallow analyses in which each phrasestructure rule will have many daughter categories will tend to reduce the applicability of each rule.
E89-1035.txt,36,In these respects_comma_ the ANLT grammar is a more conventional generative grammar_comma_ based on recent monostratal approaches to syntactic description.
E89-1035.txt,37,Syntactic categories are feature complexes and unification is employed as the method of grammatical combination.
E89-1035.txt,38,Syntactic generalisations are expressed in terms of partially specified immediate dominance rules_comma_ linear precedence rules and a variety of metagrammatical statements concerning feature defaults_comma_ propagation_comma_ optional pre postmodification_comma_ and so forth.
E89-1035.txt,39,4 In addition_comma_ the particular analysis of NPs adopted recognises a number of intermediate nominal categories such as N bar _comma_ as well as recursion within these categories_comma_ and this ensures that most individual rules mention fewer daughters than would be typical in the analysis used in the description of the LOB treebank.
E89-1035.txt,40,For these reasons_comma_ we felt that a fairer test of Sampson s claims would be to evaluate the same corpus of NPs with respect to the ANLT grammar.
E89-1035.txt,41,In addition_comma_ this exeereise would provide valuable information concerning the real adequacy of the account of English NPs incorporated into this grammar.
E89-1035.txt,42,THE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE A superset of the corpus of data analysed by Sampson 1987a was extracted from the LOB treebank using tree searching software developed by the first author and Roger Garside of Lancaster University s computing department.
E89-1035.txt,43,Following Sampson_comma_ we ignored categories G Belles lettres_comma_ biography_comma_ essays and P Romance and love story from the treebank data base.
E89-1035.txt,44,The omission of this treebank data merely reflects the state of development of the treebank at the time when Sampson undertook his experiment.
E89-1035.txt,45,However_comma_ Sampson also ignored coordination because he felt that coordination reduction and such phenomena would create special complications .
E89-1035.txt,46,We include results for the coordinated examples because the ANLT grammar contains the required rules.
E89-1035.txt,47,In other respects_comma_ the initial samples are identical both being drawn from an identical 38_comma_212 word sample from the treebank.
E89-1035.txt,48,Of the 10_comma_150 NPs in this sample of the treebank_comma_ 17 were rejected because they were incorrectly analysed and either were not_comma_ in fact_comma_ NPs or else the boundaries of the putative NP were incorrectly marked and_comma_ therefore_comma_ our access software failed.
E89-1035.txt,49,The remaining 10_comma_133 NPs were initially sorted into single and multi constituent NPs according to the LOB model of analysis .
E89-1035.txt,50,Single constituent NPs were further sorted according to the incidence and order of their immediate lexical constituents and multi constituent NPs according to the incidence_comma_ order and attachment of their immediate daughters.
E89-1035.txt,51,At this point_comma_ we discarded a further 119 NPs which were tagged in a way which indicated they contained either foreign phrases for example_comma_ fait accomplO or mathematical formulae and symbols. These are tagged but not analysed internally in the treebank. We assume that they are irrelevant to the syntax of English NPs. These steps resulted in 10_comma_014 NPs being sorted into 2358 distinct NP types. These types must be identical with Sampson s initial analysis modulo the inclusion of coordination and exclusion of formulae and foreign phrases because they are based entirely on the literal form of the tags in the LOB treebank.
E89-1035.txt,52,The next stage of our analysis was to semiautomatically reduce these 2358 NP types into fewer types by collapsing together tags on the basis of grammatical generalisations exploited in the ANLT grammar rules and implicit in the LOB tag names.
E89-1035.txt,53,For example_comma_ there is no purpose in treating NPs identical apart from the number of the head noun as distinct although they are tagged distinctly because the ANLT grammar will deploy precisely the same set of rules to analyse them.
E89-1035.txt,54,Sampson 1987a also collapsed types by generalising across tags_comma_ however_comma_ he gives no details of this procedure_comma_ so it is impossible to quantify the extent to which our analyses diverged at this point.
E89-1035.txt,55,Following Sampson_comma_ we ignored the internal structure of postmodifiers such as PPs_comma_ relative clauses_comma_ etc. and of possessive premodifiers.
E89-1035.txt,56,However_comma_ in order not to trivialise the experiment we analysed the same set of lexical data covered by his analysis regardless of whether lexical items are treated as immediate constituents of NP in the ANLT grammar.
E89-1035.txt,57,For example_comma_ 257 sequences of simple adjectival or possessive premodifiers are directly attached to the topmost NP node in the treebank_comma_ so we consider these cases in our results.
E89-1035.txt,58,We also performed some manual editing of the LOB examples to remove punctuation.
E89-1035.txt,59,The ANLT grammar contains no rules referring to punctuation since we do not regard punctuation as a syntactic phenomenon.
E89-1035.txt,60,However_comma_ where punctuation reflects a genuine syntactic distinction such as that between restrictive and nonrestrictive postmodification _comma_ examples were classified appropriately.
E89-1035.txt,61,This approach probably gives us a slight edge over Sampson in terms of the generalising power of our rules_comma_ but we do not regard this as pernicious because we do not recognise a syntactic difference between examples such as the man with red shoes in the park and the man with red shoes_comma_ in the park_comma_ gjven the semantically intuitive analysis.
E89-1035.txt,62,48 NPs contained brackets_comma_ of which 34 signalled appositional or parenthetical material.
E89-1035.txt,63,The appositional cases were parsed with brackets deleted.
E89-1035.txt,64,The parenthetical cases were counted as failures see below for further discussion .
E89-1035.txt,65,In 8 of the remaining cases_comma_ the brackets were internal to an embedded constituent and were_comma_ therefore_comma_ irrelevant.
E89-1035.txt,66,3 further examples contained point numbering or marking i.e. a ... b ... conventions and the final 3 enclosed ordinary modifiers.
E89-1035.txt,67,These 6 examples were parsed with brackets and numbering marking conventions removed.
E89-1035.txt,68,These steps resulted in 707 distinct NP types.
E89-1035.txt,69,Sampson 1987a found 747 types.
E89-1035.txt,70,When one considers that punctuation will have increased the number of types he found_comma_ it seems likely that we have probably reanalysed the data in a manner quite similar to his original analysis.
E89-1035.txt,71,One token of each of the 707 revised types of NP was parsed using the ANLT grammar NP rules.
E89-1035.txt,72,Initially_comma_ we attempted to perform this analysis automatically using the ANLT project parser in batch mode.
E89-1035.txt,73,The words in the example to be parsed were replaced with their lexical tags and a lexicon was created relating tags to lexical syntactic categories in the ANLT grammar.
E89-1035.txt,74,Data from the treebank and other data from two different corpora were parsed in this fashion and the output was manually analysed to select the semantically correct analysis_comma_ weed out false positives where the system had assigned one or more incorrect analyses_comma_ and to diagnose the reasons for parse failure.
E89-1035.txt,75,Failures occurred beth because of inadequacies in grammatical coverage and because of resource limitations with some long and multiply ambiguous NPs.
E89-1035.txt,76,The resulting data contained many cases of multiple analyses of the type expected using a grammar containing rules to handle PP attachment and compounding see_comma_ for example_comma_ Church Patil_comma_ 1982 .
E89-1035.txt,77,The intention was to compute the frequency with which each rule of the grammar applied and the overall success rate of the grammar parser from these manually edited files.
E89-1035.txt,78,However_comma_ the process of evaluating and searching for correct analyses amongst very high numbers of automatically generated parses required more effort than manually applying the rules to check that the semantically correct analysis could be produced.
E89-1035.txt,79,This problem highlights the need for automatic semantic filtering of the parses produced_comma_ but_comma_ in the absence of a fairly comprehensive and sophisticated lexical and compositional semantic component_comma_ this was not possible.
E89-1035.txt,80,Therefore_comma_ we completed the analysis of one token of each of the 707 NP types by manually applying the ANLT grammar to check that the semantically appropriate analysis could be produced.
E89-1035.txt,81,When the correct parse was available_comma_ the rules used in this analysis were recorded.
E89-1035.txt,82,We derived a numerical index of the generality of each rule by counting each application and multiplying it by the number of tokens in each type exemplified by the parsed example.
E89-1035.txt,83,RESULTS 622 of the 707 examples were parsed successfully_comma_ yielding a success rate of 87.97 When the success rate takes account of the frequency of each NP type in the sample and indicates the proportion of successful NP parses which would be achieved by the ANLT system for this data_comma_ the figure rises to 96.88 or 9702 NPs parsed successfully out of the 10_comma_014 sample.
E89-1035.txt,84,The analyses utilised a total of 54 distinct rules expressed in the ANLT object grammar formalism.
E89-1035.txt,85,Of these 8 were additions prompted by the experiment 3 for names Mr. Joe Bloggs _comma_ I for noun compounding water meter _comma_ 2 for adverbial pre and post modification nearly a century _comma_ 1 for possessive NPs dominated by N bar the America s cup _comma_ and 1 for NPs with adjectival heads the poor .
E89-1035.txt,86,We added these rules because they express uncontroversial generalisations and represent oversights in the development of the grammar rather than ad hoc additions solely for the purposes of the experiment.
E89-1035.txt,87,These object grammar rules were produced by 7 linear precedence statements_comma_ 4 rules of feature propagation_comma_ 6 feature default rules_comma_ 3 metarules_comma_ and 50 immediate dominance rules in the metagrammar.
E89-1035.txt,88,Although the metagrammar is the seat of linguistic generalisations in our system_comma_ parsing proceeds in terms of a compiled object grammar derived from these metagrammatical statements.
E89-1035.txt,89,Therefore_comma_ statistics concerning rule application will be associated with the object grammar.
E89-1035.txt,90,We counted the number of times each of the 54 object grammar phrase structure rules would apply in the analysis of all the parsable examples in the sample.
E89-1035.txt,91,The categories of these object grammar rules still contain features with varlable values which will be instsntiated at parse time by unification.
E89-1035.txt,92,They are therefore considerably more general than similar rules with atomic or nearly atomic categories of the kind which are implicit in the treebank analyses and resulting NP types .
E89-1035.txt,93,Table 1 below presents these results.
E89-1035.txt,94,The rules used end their corresponding names are a superset of those described in Grover et al. 1987 .

E89-1035.txt,99,Other Names with pre and post titles Mr.
E89-1035.txt,103,For example_comma_ some low numbers are an artifact of the preliminary analysis into types.
E89-1035.txt,104,Thus_comma_ N2 PRO FOOT9 _comma_ which would be utilised to parse NPs consisting of wh pronouns_comma_ such as who_comma_ what_comma_ and so forth_comma_ only applies once.
E89-1035.txt,105,In the preliminary analysis_comma_ we decided to collapse together tags for the wh and non wh version of the same category.
E89-1035.txt,106,It is just an accident that in all of the representative tokens of each type which were parsed_comma_ only one wh pronoun turned up and this happened to represent a singleton type.
E89-1035.txt,107,Similarly_comma_ N1 SFIN only applies twice_comma_ but it is probable that there are more examples of nouns taking sentential complements as arguments in the sample.
E89-1035.txt,108,The LOB tagset represents these complements by Fn and relative clauses by Fr .
E89-1035.txt,109,Following Sampson_comma_ we collapsed all of these to F .
E89-1035.txt,110,Consequently_comma_ the bulk of the sentential complements were incorrectly added to the types involving postmodification by relative clauses.
E89-1035.txt,111,These problems are unavoidable_comma_ given the particular assumptions built into the LOB treebank analyses_comma_ unless a completely new analysis of the sample was undertaken.
E89-1035.txt,112,One way of ameliorating this problem is to collapse some of the distinct rules in Table 1.
E89-1035.txt,113,A number of the distinct object grammar rules are present for technical reasons connected with the use of fixed arity unification and feature propagation by variable binding in the ANLT grammar formalism and parser see Briscoe et al._comma_ 1987b_comma_c for details .
E89-1035.txt,114,Therefore_comma_ we reduced the 54 object grammar rules to 36 hypothetical rules using our judgement to determine whether a distinction between rules was motivated by a linguistic generalisation or a technical consideration peculiar to the ANLT grammar formalism.
E89-1035.txt,115,In most cases_comma_ the linguistic generalisation is_comma_ in fact_comma_ present in the metagrammar rules but compiled out in the automatic production of the equivalent object grammar.
E89-1035.txt,116,For example_comma_ rules with FOOT in their name are wh variants of other rules defined by metarules which state the manner in which they differ systematically from the non wh versions.
E89-1035.txt,117,The resulting 36 hypothetical rules are given in Table 2 along with new rule application counts based on summing the counts for the merged actual rules.
E89-1035.txt,118,We also give the figures for the number of times each rule applied in the parsing of one token of each type.
E89-1035.txt,119,The final column presents a proportioned up figure based on multiplying the second column by 15.6 since the parsed tokens represent 6.41 of the total sample .
E89-1035.txt,120,This column gives another perspective on the generalising power of the rules involved.
E89-1035.txt,121,COMPARISON OF RULES AND TYPES We suggested above that Sampson s argument against the generative concept of grammaticality is based on the assumption that each type in his original analysis will be associated with one nile.
E89-1035.txt,122,Sampson 1978a found 747 types of which 468 were singleton types containing only one token_comma_ or 62.65 singleton types.
E89-1019.txt,1,SRI Core Language Engine CLE is a general purpose natural language front end for interactive systems. It translates English expressions into representations of their literal meanings.
E89-1019.txt,2,This paper _comma_ presents the lexical acquisition component of the CLE_comma_ which allows the creation of lexicon entries by users with knowledge of the application domain but not of linguistics or of the detailed workings of the system.
E89-1019.txt,3,It is argued that the need to cater for a wide range of types of back end leads naturally to an approach based on eliciting grammaticality judgments from the user.
E89-1019.txt,4,This approach_comma_ which has been used to define a 1200 word core lexicon of En glish_comma_ is described and evaluated.
E89-1019.txt,6,The SRI Core Language Engine CLE A1shawi et al_comma_ 1988a_comma_b is a domain independent system for translating English sentences into formal representations of their literal meanings which are capable of supporting reasoning.
E89-1019.txt,7,It is designed to be used as a major component of interactive advisor systems such as interfaces to database management systems and diagnostic expert systems.
E89-1019.txt,8,The main contribution of the CLE is intended to be substantial coverage of English constructions in both syntax and semantics that is well motivated and hence extensible.
E89-1019.txt,9,The CLE makes use of three main types of lexicon entry.
E89-1019.txt,10,A syntactic entry for a word consists of one or more complex categories_comma_ each specified by a principal category symbol augmented by a set of constraints on the values of syntactic features.
E89-1019.txt,11,Such categories also appear in the CLE s grammar_comma_ and matching and merging of the information encoded in them carried out by unification during parsing.
E89-1019.txt,12,Word sense entries for words are specified in the same way_comma_ but involve semantic as well as syntactic features.
E89-1019.txt,13,Semantic interpretation_comma_ which takes place in tandem with parsing_comma_ works by unification of feature values in word sense entries and semantic interpretation rules.
E89-1019.txt,14,Sortal selectional restrictions are defined for logical form predicates i.e. word senses .
E89-1019.txt,15,After possible semantic interpretations are constructed_comma_ the CLE applies these restrictions with reference to a userdefinable hierarchy of sortal classes_comma_ to reject any interpretations in which the sort expected by some argument 137 of a predicate is inconsistent with that of the object filling that argument.
E89-1019.txt,16,The CLE lexical acquisition tool VEX for Vocabulary EXpander allows the creation of CLE lexicon entries by users with knowledge both of English and of the application domain_comma_ but not of linguistic theory or of the way lexical entries are represented in the CLE.
E89-1019.txt,17,It asks the user for information on the grammaticality of example sentences_comma_ and for selectional restrictions on arguments of predicates_comma_ and writes to disc a set of instructions that can immediately be used by the CLE to create appropriate lexical entries automatically in main memory.
E89-1019.txt,18,2 THE TASK OF LEXICAL ACQUISITION VEX s task is to aid in the creation of lexi cal entries that will allow the CLE to map certain English expressions into appropriate logical form predicates.
E89-1019.txt,19,These predicates are expected then to receive further application specific processing.
E89-1019.txt,20,A crucial factor in designing VEX was that virtually no assumptions can be made about the nature of this subsequent processing or about the representations_comma_ if any_comma_ into which predicates will be mapped indeed_comma_ the main use of VEX so far_comma_ one which suggests its viability_comma_ has been to construct the CLE s 1200 word core lexicon_comma_ which is intended to be application independent.
E89-1019.txt,21,This situation contrasts with that obtaining in_comma_ for example_comma_ the TEAM system Grosz et al_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1019.txt,22,Whereas the CLE is intended to interface to a range of back end systems_comma_ TEAM was designed specifically as a front end for databases of a particular kind.
E89-1019.txt,23,This means that lexical acquisition in TEAM is essentially a matter of determining the English counterparts of particular database relations_comma_ and that the possibilities for word behaviours are constrained by the kinds of relations that exist.
E89-1019.txt,24,Furthermore_comma_ TEAM s coverage of verb subcategorization is rather more limited than that of the CLE.
E89-1019.txt,25,Thus TEAM is able to allow the user to volunteer a sentence from which_comma_ with the help of some hard wired auxiliary questions_comma_ it infers the syntactic and semantic characteristics of the way a verb and its arguments map into the database.
E89-1019.txt,26,However_comma_ because of the CLE s wide syntactic coverage and the lack of constraints from any known application_comma_ it is too risky to allow the user to volunteer sentences to VEX.
E89-1019.txt,27,Instead_comma_ VEX itself presents example sentences to the user and asks whether or not they are acceptable.
E89-1019.txt,28,In addition_comma_ the logical forms produced are of a fairly neutral_comma_ conservative nature_comma_ and correspond one to one to the individual surface syntactic subcategorization s that are identified for example_comma_ related usages like the transitive and intransitive uses of break John broke the window vs. The window broke will be mapped onto different predicates_comma_ leaving it to the back end to make whatever it needs to of the relationship between them.
E89-1019.txt,29,Thus apart from eliciting selectional restrictions_comma_ virtually all of VEX s processing is done at the level of syntax.
E89-1019.txt,30,3 THE STRATEGY ADOPTED VEX adopts a copy and edit strategy in constructing lexical entries.
E89-1019.txt,31,It is provided with pointers to entries in a paradigm lexicon for a number of representative word usages and declarative knowledge of the range of sentential contexts in which these usages can occur.
E89-1019.txt,33,Entries in the paradigm lexicon are distinguished not only by the type and number of arguments they take_comma_ but also by phenomena such as tough movement _comma_ subject raising and equi NP deletion.
E89-1019.txt,34,VEX elicits grammaticality judgments from the user to determine which paradigm or set of paradigms occurs in the same contexts as the word being defined_comma_ and then constructs the new entries by making substitutions in these paradigm entries.
E89-1019.txt,35,Each use of a paradigm will give rise to one distinct predicate.
E89-1019.txt,36,An alternative to this copy and edit strategy would be a more detailed_comma_ knowledge based method in which VEX was equipped with knowledge of the function of every feature and other construct in the representation_comma_ and asked the user questions in order to build entries in a bottomup fashion.
E89-1019.txt,37,However_comma_ such an approach has several drawbacks.
E89-1019.txt,38,The complexity of the representation would make a bottom up approach unwieldy and time consuming_comma_ both for the builder of VEX ana for the user_comma_ who would have to answer an inordinately long list of questions for every new entry.
E89-1019.txt,39,Furthermore_comma_ interaction at the level of individual linguistic features would allow genuinely novel entries to be created_comma_ which_comma_ given that the user is a non linguist_comma_ Would almost certainly lead to inconsistencies.
E89-1019.txt,40,In addition_comma_ endowing VEX directly with knowledge of the representation would mean that as the representation developed_comma_ VEX would continually have to be updated.
E89-1019.txt,41,The copy and edit approach_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ makes VEX independent of most changes to the representation.
E89-1019.txt,42,Furthermore_comma_ the fact that its knowledge is specified at the level of word behaviours_comma_ means that as the CLE s coverage increases_comma_ modifications to this knowledge are easy to make.
E89-1019.txt,43,It also makes robust and relatively succinct interaction with the user easier to achieve.
E89-1019.txt,44,4 ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE STRATEGY The appropriateness of VEX s strategy depends on a number of assumptions_comma_ including the following.
E89-1019.txt,45,Firstly_comma_ it assumes that the syntactic behaviours of arbitrary words are describable in terms of a fixed_comma_ manageably small set of paradigms.
E89-1019.txt,46,The alternative view_comma_ which has been argued for by Gross 1975 _comma_ is that in fact every word is in some way idiosyncratic.
E89-1019.txt,47,I offer no counterarguments to that position here_comma_ but merely observe that as far as copy and edit lexical acquisition is concerned_comma_ it is a counsel of despair if every word has its peculiarities_comma_ then every lexical entry must be constructed from scratch by a trained linguist either by hand or using a bottom up lexical acquisition tool of the kind dismissed above for use by non linguists .
E89-1019.txt,48,VEX s approach_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ can be expected to work if the approzimate regularities that undoubtedly do exist are strong enough that the exceptions will not cause major problems_comma_ and this indeed seems to be the case for open class words.
E89-1019.txt,49,VEX does not attempt to deal with closed class words_comma_ as these are more idiosyncratic_comma_ and in any case are few enough for entries to be written for them by hand as part of the development of the CLE.
E89-1019.txt,50,Secondly_comma_ however_comma_ even once we accept the use of a finite paradigm set_comma_ there is the question of what those paradigms are.
E89-1019.txt,51,One might at first think that paradigms would be represented by typical tran 139 sitive verbs_comma_ count nouns and so on but in fact_comma_ such typical words are very hard to find_comma_ because in practice almost every word has a range of behaviours that it shares with various other words.
E89-1019.txt,52,If we imagine an ideal hand coded lexicon for the whole language_comma_ then the entry for a word will consist of a set of categories_comma_ each of which allows a number of syntactic patterns of use.
E89-1019.txt,53,The mappings between words and categories_comma_ and between categories and patterns_comma_ are both manyto many indeed_comma_ one category may allow the same set of patterns as a collection of other categories by virtue of leaving unspecified a feature value which the other categories collectively enumerate.
E89-1019.txt,54,We define a paradigm as any minimal non empty intersection of entries_comma_ or_comma_ equivalently_comma_ as any maximal set of categories with the same distribution among entries.
E89-1019.txt,55,That is_comma_ every category in a paradigm will occur in exactly the same set of entries in the ideal lexicon as every other category if any in that paradigm and every entry will be a disjoint union of paradigms.
E89-1019.txt,56,The reason this grain size for paradigms is correct is as follows.
E89-1019.txt,57,Any smaller grain size would result in some pairs of paradigms always occurring together in entries_comma_ thereby multiplying the number of distinct predicate names and losing generality.
E89-1019.txt,58,A larger grain size_comma_ however_comma_ would mean that some words either could not be assigned a consistent set of paradigms_comma_ or would be assigned the same category more than once_comma_ leading to spurious multiple analyses.
E89-1019.txt,59,The third assumption on which VEX s strategy is based is that judgments of grammaticality are to a large extent shared between speakers of the language and tend to be absolute_comma_ binary ones.
E89-1019.txt,60,Experience has shown_comma_ however_comma_ that different users have different intuitions_comma_ and even the same user can give different answers on different occasions.
E89-1019.txt,61,To deal with this problem_comma_ if VEX receives a set of judgments from which it cannot form a consistent paradigm set_comma_ it offers the user a choice of ways in which he can change his mind this process of negotiation usually arrives at a satisfactory conclusion.
E89-1019.txt,62,The user can also choose to backtrack at any time.
E89-1019.txt,63,In any case_comma_ although grammaticality judgments are sometimes variable and indeterminate_comma_ they are much less so than judgments of semantic acceptability_comma_ which do not play any part in VEX s main decision making process.
E89-1019.txt,64,In order to remind the user to judge grammaticality rather than semantic wellformedness_comma_ VEX presents example sentences containing nonsense nouns such as thingummy and whatsit .
E89-1019.txt,65,5 ELICITING SYNTACTIC INFORMATION The algorithm for defining a new word or phrase specified by the user is as described here an example of its operation follows.
E89-1019.txt,66,First_comma_ the user is asked for the part s of speech of the new item noun_comma_ verb_comma_ etc no further grammatical knowledge is assumed .
E89-1019.txt,67,The rest of the definition process takes place separately for each part of speech.
E89-1019.txt,68,VEX majors on verb and adjective definitions_comma_ and knows about only very gross distinctions between noun types e.g. count vs. mass nouns _comma_ because other distinctions_comma_ notably that between relational and non relational nouns_comma_ arguably have as much to do with pragm_atics as with syntax and are therefore left for later back end processing to deal with.
E89-1019.txt,69,After determining any irregular inflectional forms_comma_ VEX elicits grammaticality judgments from the user.
E89-1019.txt,70,In the most recently released version of the system_comma_ 140VEX knows about 52 different paradigms and their grammaticality in the context of 52 different sentential patterns.
E89-1019.txt,71,1 Its task is to discover the behaviour of the new word or phrase by presenting as few example sentences to the user as possible_comma_ and then to find the minimal subset of the paradigms that between them account for that behaviour.
E89-1019.txt,72,The sets of paradigms and sentences are progressively reduced as follows. Paradigms for a different part of speech or number of words from those of the new phrase are eliminated. VEX removes sentence patterns which either do not correspond to any surviving paradigms_comma_ or whose grammaticality can be deduced from that of other patterns in the subset.
E89-1019.txt,73,For example if sentence pattern S1 is grammatical when and only when a word or phrase with paradigm P1 is inserted in it sentence pattern 2 is grammatical only for paradigm P2 and sentence pattern 3 is grammatical only for P1 and P2 then there is no point in presenting 3 to the user if S1 and 2 are also to be presented_comma_ because 3 will be grammatical when and only when either S1 or 2 or both are grammatical.
E89-1019.txt,74,Thus VEX orders the candidate sentence patterns according to the number of paradigms associated with them_comma_ and eliminates from the resulting list any patterns whose paradigm set is exactly the union of those of one or more later items. The remaining sentence patterns_comma_ with forms of the item being defined substituted in_comma_ are presented to the user_comma_ who states which of them are grammatical.
E89-1019.txt,75,Because the number of possible word behaviours is quite large_comma_ up to 18 sentences may be presented in this way instead of immediately making a full choice_comma_ therefore_comma_ VEX allows the user to make a par1The equality of these numbers is coincidental. tial choice_comma_ and will then provide further guidance by specifying what paradigms might be implied by that choice_comma_ and what other sentences would need to be judged grammatical for those paradigms to be acceptable. Some of the user s approved sentences may be false positives in the sense that they are grammatical only by virtue of resulting from another grammatical sentence by an operation such as pronominalization or addition of an optional prepositional phrase.
E89-1019.txt,76,VEX detects any such sentence pairs and eliminates false positives_comma_ sometimes with reference to the user s answer to a yes no question about any implications holding between the sentences. VEX then tries to find a minimal set of paradigms which_comma_ together_comma_ occur in all and only the contexts the user has marked as grammatical.
E89-1019.txt,77,At this point_comma_ one of the following occurs a There is exactly one minimal set.
E89-1019.txt,78,This set is accepted_comma_ and VEX moves on to consider semantic aspects of the new entry see section 7 below . b There are no minimal sets_comma_ because every set of paradigms that together allows the sentences the user has said are grammatical also allows a sentence that was by implication judged ungrammatical.
E89-1019.txt,79,This occurs quite often because users frequently ignore sentences_comma_ misread them_comma_ or simply have different intuitions on them from those embodied in the CLE s data.
E89-1019.txt,80,VEX responds by asking the user to accept one of several additions to_comma_ or deletions from_comma_ the grammatical set.
E89-1019.txt,81,The user may either accept a revision or reconsider his assumptions and backtrack to some earlier point in the dialogue.
E89-1019.txt,82,The backtracking mechanism is in fact available throughout a VEX session_comma_ and allows the user to restart the dialogue from a range of earlier points.
E89-1019.txt,83,141 c There are several minimal sets of the same size.
E89-1019.txt,84,In this case_comma_ VEX prefers less ambiguous sets_comma_ i.e. those that minimize the number of occasions that two paradigms in the set both account for the grammaticality of a sentence and hence could lead to apparent ambiguity in parsing .
E89-1019.txt,85,If this does not select a unique paradigm set_comma_ VEX chooses a set at random and warns the user of the conflict such conflicts almost always result from VEX being unable to separate two distinct behaviours for a phrase_comma_ a situation which can be remedied by the user presenting the behaviours to VEX in two separate dialogues.
E89-1019.txt,86,6 AN EXAMPLE Suppose the user wishes to define the phrasal verb use up .
E89-1019.txt,87,After morphological information has been supplied_comma_ VEX presents the following list of sentences I The thingummy used up.
E89-1019.txt,88,2 The thingummy used the whatsit up.
E89-1019.txt,89,3 The whatsit was used up by the thingummy.
E89-1019.txt,90,4 The thingummy used the boojum up very good.
E89-1019.txt,91,5 The boojum was used up the whatsit by the thingummy.
E89-1019.txt,92,6 The whatsit was used up for the boojumby the thingummy.
E89-1019.txt,93,7 The thingummy used up existing.
E89-1019.txt,94,8 The thingummy used up the whatsit that the boojum existed. The whatsit was used up by the thingummy to exist. and invites the user to specify which ones are grammatical in the domain in question.
E89-1019.txt,95,The user would approve sentences 2_comma_ 3 and 9 only.
E89-1019.txt,96,VEX then considers the possibility that_comma_ because sentence 3 is grammatical_comma_ sentence 9 is grammatical only when to exist is an optional modifier.
E89-1019.txt,97,This is in fact the case.
E89-1019.txt,98,It asks the user Does the whatsit was used up by the thingummy to exist necessarily imply the whatsit was used up by the thingummy IN ORDER TO exist 7 When the user answers affirmatively_comma_ sentence 9 is dropped from consideration.
E89-1019.txt,99,Contrast the case of call on _comma_ where The board called on the chairman to resign can mean something quite different from The board called on the chairman in order to resign .
E89-1019.txt,100,VEX now has enough information to decide that use up behaves syntactically as a transitive particle verb.
E89-1019.txt,101,7 ELICITING SEMANTIC INFORMATION Once a set of paradigms has been established_comma_ VEX asks for a name for the predicate corresponding to each one_comma_ and then for sortal restrictions on the predicate and its arguments.
E89-1019.txt,102,Sortal restrictions may be given to VEX directly as a list interpreted conjunctively of atoms occurring in the sort hierarchy currently in force_comma_ or indirectly as a pointer to sortal restrictions on another predicate or one of its arguments.
E89-1019.txt,103,If an explicit list is provided_comma_ they are checked for existence in the sort hierarchy currently in force and for mutual consistency in terms of that hierarchy e.g. the list male female would normally be rejected _comma_ but no check is made for the existence of other predicates referred to_comma_ since these may not yet have been defined or incorporated into the system.
E89-1019.txt,104,VEX allows he user to specify any number of alternative sets of restrictions on a predicate.
E89-1019.txt,105,However_comma_ the use of more than one set is discouraged_comma_ because if the 142 alternative restrictions are assigned to distinct predicates then the CLE will be able to provide the back end system with more information than would otherwise be possible.
E89-1019.txt,106,8 FURTHER PROCESSING When selectional restrictions have been acquired_comma_ VEX writes out to disc a set of implicit lexical entries.
E89-1019.txt,107,Implicit lexical entries are instructions interpreted by CLE code that makes substitutions_comma_ for words and predicate names_comma_ in entries for the paradigms that VEX knows about.
E89-1019.txt,108,The results of these substitutions are explicit_comma_ feature based entries_comma_ which are then compiled directly into the format used by the parser itself.
E89-1019.txt,109,Both expansion and compilation happen automatically and are hidden from the user thus as soon as a word is defined with VEX_comma_ it can be used in an input sentence.
E89-1019.txt,110,The are three main advantages in introducing this implicit level of representation.
E89-1019.txt,111,Firstly_comma_ implicit entries are much smaller than explicit and compiled ones_comma_ which results in considerable saving of space since the latter are only generated on demand.
E89-1019.txt,112,Secondly_comma_ if the paradigm entries are later changed_comma_ for example because of developments in the feature system_comma_ existing implicit entries will usually not need to be altered their explicit and compiled forms will automatically come to reflect those of the paradigm entries when the system is recompiled.
E89-1019.txt,113,This has occurred many times during the development of the CLE.
E89-1019.txt,114,Thirdly_comma_ implicit entries are also rather shorter than explicit ones and are therefore easier to edit by hand where desired.
E89-1019.txt,115,Hand editing is appropriate on those occasions when VEX has not quite produced the desired results_comma_ either because of peculiarities in the phrase being defined_comma_ or more commonly because the user changes his mind about what detailed responses to VEX are appropriate for example_comma_ changing a predicate name and does not wish to redefine the phrase from scratch.
E89-1019.txt,116,It can also be useful if_comma_ for example_comma_ the sort hierarchy is extended after some entries have been defined_comma_ and it is necessary to update the sortal restrictions on those entries to take full advantage of the extension.
E89-1019.txt,117,9 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The application independence of the CLE leads to a style of lexical acquisition different from that of earlier_comma_ dedicated naturallanguage front ends.
E89-1019.txt,118,I have argued for a technique based on a limited number of syntactic paradigms_comma_ a subset of which are selected for the construction of new entries according to the user s judgments of sentence grammaticality.
E89-1019.txt,119,This allows the lexical acquisition component to avoid strong dependencies on the CLE s linguistic representation_comma_ the application domain_comma_ the nature of the back end system_comma_ or the user s knowledge of linguistics.
E89-1019.txt,120,VEX s concentration on syntactic paradigms allows a wide range of subcategorization types to be recognised and dealt with_comma_ and also permits a non trivial lexicon to be easily maintained while the system is under development.
E89-1019.txt,121,The use of VEX to define the CLE s 1200 word core lexicon is evidence for the practicality of the approach.
E89-1019.txt,122,The crucial factor in evaluating VEX_comma_ however_comma_ is its acceptability to the nonlinguist but application expert users for whom it was designed.
E89-1019.txt,123,No formal evaluation of this has been carried out_comma_ but informal feedback from members of the companies to whom a version of the CLE was delivered in the summer of 1988 has been 143 generally positive.
E89-1019.txt,124,It appears that_comma_ once they have studied the annotated VEX session transcript distributed with the CLE documentation_comma_ those who have so far used the system have had no great difficulty with the idea of using nonsense words or with concepts such as grammaticality and paradigms.
E89-1019.txt,125,Perhaps the most difficult task faced by the VEX user is to decide which of the sentences presented are grammatical however_comma_ this task is significantly eased by the possibility of backtracking_comma_ by the consistency checker_comma_ and by the partial choice facility_comma_ all of which were implemented in response to comments by users of earlier versions of the system.
E89-1019.txt,126,The difficulties that remain seem largely due to the fact that the CLE is intended to be usable in as wide as possible a range of hardware and software environments_comma_ so that the interface cannot assume any graphical facilities such as cursor addressable displays.
E89-1019.txt,127,Were such facilities to be available_comma_ the system could provide step by step feedback on the consequences of individual grammaticality judgments.
E89-1019.txt,128,The fact that VEX is not specific to any one application domain or type of backend system_comma_ and is relatively loosely coupled to the internal characteristics of the CLE_comma_ means that the techniques it embodies should in principle be applicable to even if not always optimal or sufficient in a wide range of natural language processing contexts.
E89-1019.txt,129,Indeed_comma_ it might be possible to produce a version of VEX with clearlydefined interfaces at morphological_comma_ syntactic and semantic levels that could simply be plugged in to a range of existing systems to provide them with a lexical acquisition capability.
E89-1019.txt,130,10 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Development of the CLE has been carried out as part of a research programme in natural language processing supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry under Alvey grant ALV PRJ IKBS 105 and by members of the NATTIE consortium British Aerospace_comma_ British Telecom_comma_ Hewlett Packard_comma_ ICL_comma_ Olivetti_comma_ Philips_comma_ Shell Research_comma_ and SRI .
E89-1019.txt,131,I would like to thank the CLE development team_comma_ and various members of the consortium organizations_comma_ for valuable criticisms and suggestions.
E89-1012.txt,1,this paper_comma_ we present a logic based computational model for movement theory in Government and Binding Theory. For that purpose_comma_ we have designed a language called DISLOG.
E89-1012.txt,2,DISLOG stands for programming in logic with discontinuities and permits to express in a simple_comma_ concise and declarative way relations or constraints between non contiguous elements in a structure.
E89-1012.txt,3,DISLOG is also weel adapted to model other types of linguistic phenomena like Quantifier Raising involving long distance relations or constraints.
E89-1012.txt,5,Many areas of natural language syntax and semantics are a fruitful source of inspiration for computer languages and systems designers.
E89-1012.txt,6,The complexity of natural language and the high level of .
E89-1016.txt,1,paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems. We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use_comma_ e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval.
E89-1016.txt,2,This raises questions about the validity of such approaches.
E89-1016.txt,3,In the second half of the paper_comma_ we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task.
E89-1016.txt,4,We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique_comma_ place upon a prototype Natural Language system.
E89-1016.txt,5,We identify three important requirements which arose from the task that we gave our subjects operators specific to the task of database access_comma_ complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source.
E89-1016.txt,6,We discuss how these might be satisfied by future Natural Language systems.
E89-1016.txt,8,1.1 Approaches to the evaluation of NL systems It is clear that a number of different criteria might be employed in the evaluation of Natural Language NL systems.
E89-1016.txt,10,Among the different criteria that have been suggested are a Coverage b Learnability c General software requirements d Comparison with other interface media.
E89-1016.txt,11,Coverage is concerned with the set of inputs which the system should be capable of handling and one issue we will discuss is how this set should be identified.
E89-1016.txt,12,Learnability is premised on the fact that complete coverage is not forseeable in the near future.
E89-1016.txt,13,As a consequence_comma_ any NL system will have limitations and one problem for users will be to learn to communicate within such limitations.
E89-1016.txt,14,Learnability is measured by the ease with which new users are able to identify these coverage limitations_comma_ and exploit what coverage is available to carry out their task.
E89-1016.txt,15,The general software criteria of importance are speed_comma_ size_comma_ modifiability and installation and maintenance costs.
E89-1016.txt,17,Our discussion will mainly address the problem of coverage we shall not discuss these other issues further.
E89-1016.txt,18,Our concern here will be with interactive NL interfaces and not other applications of NL technology such as MT or messaging systems.
E89-1016.txt,19,Interactive interfaces are not designed to be used in isolation_comma_ rather_comma_ they are intended to be connected to some sort of backend system_comma_ to improve access to that system.
E89-1016.txt,20,Our view is that NL systems should be evaluated with this in mind the aim will be to identify the NL inputs which a typical user would want to enter in order to utillse that backend system to carry out a representative task.
E89-1016.txt,21,By representative task we mean the class of task that the back end system was designed to carry out.
E89-1016.txt,22,In the case of databases_comma_ this would be accessing or updating information.
E89-1016.txt,23,For expert systems it might involve identifying or diagnosing faults. I.I.I Test suites One method that is often used in computer science for the evaluation of systems is the use of test suites.
E89-1016.txt,25,One problem with this approach is how we determine whether the test set is complete.
E89-1016.txt,26,Do we have a clear notion of what constitute the major phenomena of language so that we can generate test sentences which identify whether these have been analysed correctly
E89-1016.txt,27,Theories of syntax are well developed and may provide us with a good taxonomy of syntactic phenomena_comma_ but we do not have similar classifications of key pragmatic requirements.
E89-1016.txt,28,There are two reasons why current approaches may fail to identify the key phenomena.
E89-1016.txt,29,Current test sets are organised on a single utterance basis_comma_ with certain exceptions such as intersentential anaphora and ellipsis.
E89-1016.txt,31,In addition_comma_ context may contribute to inputs being fragmentary or telegraphic in style.
E89-1016.txt,32,Unless we investigate systems being used to carry out tasks_comma_ such phenomena will continue to he omitted from our test suites and NL systems will have to be substantially modified when they are connected to their backend systems.
E89-1016.txt,33,Thus we are not arguing against the use of test suites in principle but rather are attempting to determine what methodology should be used to design such test suites.
E89-1016.txt,34,1.1.2 Field studies In field studies_comma_ subjects are given the NL interface connected to some application and encouraged to make use of it.
E89-1016.txt,35,It would seem that these studies would offer vital information about target requirements.
E89-1016.txt,37,The problem here may be with finding committed users who are prepared to make serious use of a fragile system.
E89-1016.txt,38,A major problem with such studies concerns the robustness of the systems which were tested and this leads to difficulties in the interpretation of the results.
E89-1016.txt,39,This is because a fragile system necessarily imposes limitations on the ways that a user can interact with it.
E89-1016.txt,40,We cannot therefore infer that the set of sentences that users input when they have adjusted to a fragile system_comma_ reflects the set of inputs that they would wish to enter given a system with fewer limitations.
E89-1016.txt,41,In other words we cannot infer that such inputs represent the way that users would ideally wish to interact using NL.
E89-1016.txt,42,The users may well have been employing strategies to communicate within the limitations of the system and they may therefore have been using a highly restricted form of English.
E89-1016.txt,44,Since we cannot currently envisage a system without limitations_comma_ we may want to exploit this ability to learn system limitations_comma_ nevertheless the existence of such user strategies does not give us a clear view of what language might have been used in the absence of these limitations.
E89-1016.txt,45,1.1.3 Pen and paper tasks One technique which overcomes some of the problems of robustness has been to use pen and paper tasks.
E89-1016.txt,47,This technique has also been employed to evaluate formal query languages such as SQL.
E89-1016.txt,48,The subjects of the study are given a sample task A list of alumni in the state of California has been requested.
E89-1016.txt,49,The request applies to those alumni whose last name starts with an S.
E89-1016.txt,50,Obtain such a list containing last names and first names.
E89-1016.txt,51,When the subjects have generated their natural language query_comma_ it is evaluated by judges to determine whether it would have successfully elicited the information from the system.
E89-1016.txt,52,This approach avoids the problem of using fragile systems_comma_ but it is susceptible to the same objections as were levelled at test suites a potential drawback with the approach concerns the representativeness of the set of tasks the users are required to do when they carry out the translation tasks.
E89-1016.txt,54,As a result the translation problems may fail to test the system s coverage of discourse phenomena.
E89-1016.txt,55,1.1.4 Wizard of Oz A similar technique to pen and paper tasks has been the use of a method called the Wizard of Or henceforth WOZ which also avoids the problem of the fragility of current systems by simulating the operation of the system rather than using the system itself.
E89-1016.txt,56,117In these studies_comma_ subjects are told that they are interacting with the computer when in reality they are linked to the Wizard_comma_ a person simulating the operation of the system_comma_ over a computer network.
E89-1016.txt,58,The main result is a counterintuitive one.
E89-1016.txt,59,These studies suggest that people produce simple language when they believe that they are using an NL interface.
E89-1016.txt,61,In comparison with informal speech_comma_ the dialogues have few passives_comma_ few pronouns and few examples of fragmentary speech.
E89-1016.txt,62,One problem with the research is that it has been descriptive It has chiefly been concerned with demonstrating the fact that the language observed is simple relative to norms gathered for informal and written speech and the results are expressed at too general a level to be useful for system design.
E89-1016.txt,63,It is not enough to know_comma_ for example_comma_ that there are fewer fragments observed in WOZ type dialogues than in informal speech it is necessary to know the precise characteristics of such fragments if we are to design a system to analyse these when they occur.
E89-1016.txt,64,Despite this_comma_ our view is that WOZ represents the most promising technique for identifying the target requirements of an NL interface.
E89-1016.txt,65,However_comma_ to avoid the problem of precision described above_comma_ we modified the technique in one significant respect.
E89-1016.txt,66,Having used the WOZ technique to generate a set of sentences that users ideally require to carry out a database retrieval task_comma_ we then input these sentences into a NL system linked to the database.
E89-1016.txt,67,The target requirements are therefore evaluated against a version of a real system and we can observe the ways in which the system satisfies_comma_ or fails to satisfy_comma_ user requirements.
E89-1016.txt,68,We discuss semantics and pragmatics only insofar as they are reflected in individual lexical items.
E89-1016.txt,69,This is of some importance_comma_ given the lexical basis of the HPNL system.
E89-1016.txt,70,It must also be noted that the evaluation took place against a prototype version of HPNL.
E89-1016.txt,71,Many of the lexical errors we encountered could be removed with a trivial amount of effort.
E89-1016.txt,72,Our interest was not therefore in the absolute number of such errors_comma_ but rather with the general classes of lexical errors which arose.
E89-1016.txt,73,We present a classification of such errors below.
E89-1016.txt,74,The task we investigated was database retrieval.
E89-1016.txt,75,This was predominantly because this has been a typical application for NL interfaces.
E89-1016.txt,76,Our initial interest was in the target requirements for an NL system_comma_ i.e. what set of sentences users would enter if they were given no constraints on the types of sentences that they could input.
E89-1016.txt,77,The Wizard was therefore instructed to answer all questions subject to the limitation given below .
E89-1016.txt,78,We ensured that this person had sufficient information to answer questions about the database_comma_ and so in principle_comma_ the system was capable of handling all inputs.
E89-1016.txt,79,The subjects were asked to access information from the database about a set of paintings which possessed certain characteristics.
E89-1016.txt,80,The database contained information about Van Gogh s paintings including their age_comma_ theme_comma_ medium_comma_ and location.
E89-1016.txt,81,The subjects had to find a set of paintings which together satisfied a series of requirements_comma_ and they did this by typing English sentences into the machine.
E89-1016.txt,82,They were not told exactly what information the database contained_comma_ nor about the set of inputs the Natural Language interface might be capable of processing.
E89-1016.txt,83,2 Method 1.2 The current study The current study therefore has two components the first is a WOZ study of dialogues involved in database retrieval tasks.
E89-1016.txt,85,The results we present concern the first phase of such an analysis in which we discuss the set of words that the system failed to analyse.
E89-1016.txt,86,2.1 Subjects The 12 subjects were all familiar with using computers insofar as they had used word processors and electronic mail.
E89-1016.txt,87,A further 5 of them had used omce applications such as spreadsheets or graphics packages.
E89-1016.txt,88,Of the remainder_comma_ 4 had some experience with using databases and one of these had participated in the design a database.
E89-1016.txt,89,None of them was familiar with the current state of NL technology.
E89-1016.txt,90,1182.2 Procedure hard copy.
E89-1016.txt,91,The experimenter told the subjects that he was interested in evaluating the efficiency of English as a medium for communicating with computers.
E89-1016.txt,92,He told them that an English interface to a database was running on the machine and that the database contained information about paintings by Van Gogh and other artists.
E89-1016.txt,93,In fact this was not true the information that the subjects typed into the terminal was transmitted to a person The Wizard at another terminal who answered the subject s requests by consulting paper copies of the database tables.
E89-1016.txt,94,The experimenter then gave the details of the two tasks.
E89-1016.txt,95,Subjects were told that they had to find a set of paintings which satisfied several requirements_comma_ where a requirement might be for example that a all the paintings must come from different cities or b they must all have different themes.
E89-1016.txt,96,Having found this set_comma_ they had then to access particular information about the set of pictures that they had chosen_comma_ e.g the paint medium for each of the pictures chosen.
E89-1016.txt,97,3 Results 3.1 Preliminary analysis and filtering This analysis is concerned with user input and so the Wizard s responses are not considered here.
E89-1016.txt,98,We began by taking all the 384 subject utterances_comma_ entering them into the NL prototype and observing what analysis the system produced.
E89-1016.txt,99,We found that by far the largest category of errors was unknown words_comma_ so we began by analysing the total of 401 instances of 104 unknown words.
E89-1016.txt,100,Our interest here lay in the influence of the task on language use so we focus on 3 classes of unknown words which demonstrate this in different ways these were operators and explicit reference to set properties .
E89-1013.txt,1,paper presents a constraint logic programming language cu Prolog and introduces a simple Japanese parser based on Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar JPSG as a suitable application of cu Prolog. cu Prolog adopts constraint unification instead of the normal Prolog unification.
E89-1013.txt,2,In cu Prolog_comma_ constraints in terms of user defined predicates can be directly added to the program clauses.
E89-1013.txt,6,The program clauses of cu Prolog are following type_comma_ which we call Constraint Added Horn Clauses CAHCs 1.
E89-1013.txt,7,H Bt_comma_B2_comma_..._comma_Bn C1_comma_C2_comma_..._comma_Cm.
E89-1013.txt,8,H is called the head_comma_ B1_comma_ B2_comma_... _comma_Bn is the body_comma_ C1_comma_ C2_comma_..._comma_ Cm is the constraint. The body and the constraint can be empty. C1_comma_C2_comma_..._comma_Cm comprise a set of constraints on the variables occurring in the rest of the clause.
E89-1013.txt,9,C1_comma_ C2_comma_..._comma_ Crn must be_comma_ in the current implementation_comma_ modular in the sense that it has the following canonical form.
E89-1013.txt,13,Using constraint unification_comma_ the inference rule of cu Prolog is as follows Q_comma_ R C. _comma_ Q  S D._comma_ 0 mgu Q_comma_ Q _comma_ B my co_comma_ DO 0_comma_ R6 B Q is an atomic formula. R_comma_ C_comma_ S_comma_ D_comma_ and B are sequences of atomic formulas. mgu Q_comma_Q I is a most general unifier between Q and Q . my C1_comma_..._comma_Cm is a modular constraint which is equivalent to C1_comma_.. _comma_ Cm.
E89-1013.txt,14,If C1_comma_ ..._comma_ Cm is inconsistent_comma_ my C1_comma_..._comma_ Cm is not defined.
E89-1013.txt,15,In this case_comma_ the above inference rule is inapplicable.
E89-1013.txt,18,This transformation is done by repeating unfold fold transformations as described later.
E89-1013.txt,19,3.2 Comparison with conventional approaches In normal Prolog_comma_ constraints are inserted in a goal and processed as procedures.
E89-1013.txt,20,It is not desirable for a declarative programming language_comma_ and the execution can be ineffective when constraints are inserted in a insufficient place.
E89-1013.txt,21,As constraints are rewritten at every unification_comma_ cu Prolog has more powerful descriptive ability than the bind hook technique.
E89-1013.txt,23,Freeze has_comma_ however_comma_ two disadvantages.
E89-1013.txt,24,First_comma_ freeze cannot impose a constraint on plural variables at one time.
E89-1013.txt,25,For example_comma_ it cannot express the following CAHC.
E89-1013.txt,26,f X _comma_ g Y_comma_ Z append X_comma_ Y_comma_ Z .
E89-1013.txt,27,Second_comma_ since the contradiction between constraints is not detected until the variable is instantiated_comma_ there is a possibility of executing useless computation in constraints deadlocking.
E89-1013.txt,29,3.3 Constraint Transformation This subsection explains the mechanism of constraint transformation in cu Prolog.
E89-1013.txt,30,Let 7 be definition clauses of modularly defined constraints_comma_ be a set of constraints C1_comma_..._comma_ Cn that contains variables zl_comma_ ... _comma_zm_comma_ and p be a new m ary predicate.
E89-1013.txt,31,Let D be definition clauses of new predicates_comma_ and o TU is initially p xl_comma_..._comma_ xm C1_comma_..._comma_ C_comma_. and other new predicates are included through the constraint normalization.
E89-1013.txt,32,Then_comma_ mf returns p zl_comma_..._comma_ zm _comma_ if there exists a sequence of program clauses P0_comma_ Pl_comma_... _comma_ _comma_ and Pn is modularly defined_comma_ where Pi 1 is derived from Pi 0 i n by one of the following three types of transformations.
E89-1013.txt,33,1. unfold transformation Select one clause C from Pi and one atomic formulaA from the body of C.
E89-1013.txt,34,Let C1_comma_ ..._comma_ Cn be all the clauses whose heads unify with A_comma_ and C be the result of applying Cj to A of C j 1_comma_..._comma_ n .
E89-1013.txt,44,These clauses comprise the modular definition of p2.
E89-1013.txt,45,Thus P3 T1_comma_ T2_comma_ T3_comma_ T4_comma_ T5 _comma_ T6 _comma_ TT_comma_ T8_comma_ D3 .
E89-1013.txt,48,9 4 T1_comma_ T2_comma_ T3_comma_ T4_comma_ T5 I_comma_ T6 _comma_ TT_comma_ T8_comma_ Tg_comma_ TIO .
E89-1013.txt,49,Folding TIO by D1 will generate TIO p3 A_comma_Z_comma_EBIX3_comma_Y_comma_B pI A_comma_X_comma_Y_comma_Z .
E89-1013.txt,50,Accordingly P5 T1_comma_ T2_comma_ T3_comma_ T4_comma_ TS _comma_ T6 _comma_ T7_comma_ T8_comma_ T9_comma_ TIO .
E89-1013.txt,51,9S As a result_comma_ member A_comma_ Z _comma_ append X_comma_ Y_comma_ Z has been transformed to pl A_comma_X_comma_Y_comma_Z preserving equivalefice_comma_ and the following new clauses have been defined.
E89-1013.txt,52,T4_comma_ T5 I_comma_ T6 I_comma_ T7_comma_ T8_comma_ T9_comma_ TlOI .
E89-1013.txt,53,3.4 Implementation The source code of cu Prolog is_comma_ at present Vet 2.0 _comma_ composed of 4_comma_500 lines of language C on UNIX system.
E89-1013.txt,54,Its precise computation speed is under evaluation_comma_ but is sufficient for practical use.
E89-1013.txt,55,Implementation of the effective constraint transformation shown in above subsection requires some heuristics in the application of three transformation.
E89-1013.txt,56,Especially_comma_ in unfold transformation_comma_ one atomic formula A is selected in the following heuristic rules 1.
E89-1013.txt,57,The atomic formula of the finite predicate.
E89-1013.txt,61,The atomic formula that has lists in its argument.
E89-1013.txt,63,The atomic formula that has plural dependencies.
E89-1013.txt,65,Figure nil_comma_ or expressed by finite predicates 1 demonstrates constraint transformation.
E89-1013.txt,66,4 A JPSG parser As an application of cu Prolog_comma_ a natural language parser based on unification based grammar has been considered first of all.
E89-1013.txt,67,Since constraints can be added directly to the program clause representing a lexical entry or a phrase structure rule_comma_ the grammar is implemented more naturally and declaratively than with ordinary Prolog.
E89-1013.txt,68,Here we describe a simple Japanese parser of JPSG in cu Prolog.
E89-1013.txt,69,CAHC plays an important role in two respects.
E89-1013.txt,70,First_comma_ CAHC is used in the lexicon of homonyms or polysemic words.
E89-1013.txt,71,For example_comma_ a Japanese noun hasi is 3 way ambiguous_comma_ it means a bridge_comma_ chopsticks_comma_ or an edge.
E89-1013.txt,72,This polysemic word can be subsumed in the following single lexical entry.
E89-1013.txt,74,The value of the semantic feature is a variable SEM _comma_ and the constraint on SEM is hasi_sem SEM .
E89-1013.txt,75,Note that predicate hasi_sem is modularly defined.
E89-1013.txt,76,According to CAHC_comma_ such ambiguity may be considered at one time_comma_ instead of being divided in separate lexical entries.
E89-1013.txt,77,Japanese has such an ambiguity is also shown in conjugation_comma_ post positions_comma_ etc. They can be treated in this manner.
E89-1013.txt,78,Second_comma_ a phrase structure rule is written naturally in a CAHC.
E89-1013.txt,81,However_comma_ this cannot be described in this manner in traditional Prolog.
E89-1013.txt,83,cO lO cl IO . . member A_comma_l _comma_append I_comma_Y_comma_l . solution cT _comma_ Z_comma_ I_comma_ Y 8 12_comma_ I2_comma_ IO_comma_ Yl_comma_ Y3 append IO_comma_ YI_comma_ Y3 .
E89-1013.txt,84,c8 I2_comma_ Y3_comma_ IO_comma_ Y1_comma_ Z4 c7 I2_comma_ Z4_comma_ XO_comma_ YI .
E89-1013.txt,85,cT AO_comma_ Xl_comma_ D_comma_ II member AO_comma_ I1 .
E89-1013.txt,87,The first four lines are definitions of member and append.
E89-1013.txt,88,The lines that begin with  are user s input atomic formulas constraints .
E89-1013.txt,89,The system returns the constraint cO X that is equivalent to the input constraint_comma_ and its definitions.
E89-1013.txt,90,Figure 1 Demonstration of the constraint transformation routine Figure 2 shows a simple demonstration of our JPSG parser_comma_ and Figure 3 shows an example of treating ambiguity as constraint.
E89-1013.txt,91,The current parser treats a few feature and has little lexicon.
E89-1013.txt,92,However_comma_ the expansion is easy.
E89-1013.txt,93,It parses about ten to twenty words sentences within a second on VAX8600.
E89-1013.txt,94,Since JPSG is a declarative grammar formalism and cuProlog describes JPSG also declaratively_comma_ the parser needs parsing algorithms independently.
E89-1013.txt,97,5 Final Remarks ular.
E89-1013.txt,98,So the most difficult problem one must tackle concerns itself with heuristics about how to control computation.
E89-1013.txt,99,Acknowledgments This study owes much to our colleagues in the JPSG Working group at ICOT.
E89-1013.txt,100,The implementation of cu Prolog is supported by ICOT and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan. .
E89-1034.txt,1,account for the semi free word order of French_comma_ Unification Categorial Grammar is extended in two ways. First_comma_ verbal valencies are contained in a set rather than in a list.
E89-1034.txt,2,Second_comma_ type raised NP s are described as two sided functors.
E89-1034.txt,3,The new framework does not overgenerate i.e._comma_ it accepts all and only the sentences which are grammatical.
E89-1034.txt,4,This follows partly from the elimination of false lexical ambiguities i.e._comma_ ambiguities introduced in order to account for all the possible positions a word can be in within a sentence and partly from a system of features constraining the possible combinations. .
E89-1034.txt,5,In the version of categorial grammar henceforth_comma_ CG developed by Bar Hillel Bar Hillel 1953 _comma_ categories encode both constituency and linear precedence.
E89-1034.txt,6,Linear precedence is encoded by a ordering valencies in a list and b using directional slashes indicating whether the argument is to be found to the left or to the right of the functor.
E89-1034.txt,7,A similar approach is adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar UCG Zeevat_comma_ Klein and Calder 1987 as regards word order whereby the directional slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value pre orpost.
E89-1034.txt,8,Thus_comma_ S NPLNP in normal CG lranslates as S NP predNP post in UCG_comma_ wherepre indicates that the functor must precede the argument and post that it should follow it.
E89-1034.txt,9,Our work on French syntax supports the claim that the complicated pattern of French linearity phenomena can be treated in a framework closely related to UCG but which departs from it in two ways.
E89-1034.txt,10,First_comma_ there is no rigid assignment of an order value pre orpost to verb valencies.
E89-1034.txt,11,Second_comma_ following Gunji 1986 verbal valencies are viewed as forming a set rather than a list.
E89-1034.txt,12,As The word reported here was tan led out as part of ESPRIT Project 393 ACORD_comma_ q he Construction and Interrogation of Knowledge Bases using Natural Language Text and Grapities . a result_comma_ the syntactic behaviour of constituents is dissociated from surface ordering.
E89-1034.txt,13,Constraints on word order are described by a system of features as advocated in COszkoreit 1987 and Karttunen 1986 .
E89-1034.txt,15,UCG In UCG_comma_ the phonological_comma_ categorial_comma_ semantic and order information associated with a word is contained in a single grammar structure called a sign.
E89-1034.txt,16,This can be represented as follows.
E89-1034.txt,17,1 UCG sign Phonology Categnry Semantics Order or equivalently Phonology Category Semantics Order where colons separate the different fields of the sign.
E89-1034.txt,18,We need not concern ourselves here with the Semantics and the Phonology fields of the sign.
E89-1034.txt,19,More interesting for our purpose are the Category and the Order attributes.
E89-1034.txt,20,Following the categorial tradition_comma_ categories can be basic or complex.
E89-1034.txt,21,Basic categories are of the form HeadAFeatures where Head is one of the atomic symbols n oun _comma_ np or s entence and Features is a list of feature values.
E89-1034.txt,22,Complex categories are of the form C Sign_comma_ where C is either atomic or complex and Sign is a sign_comma_ so that departing from traditionalCG s_comma_a functorplaces constraints on the whole sign of the argument rather than on its syntactic category only.
E89-1034.txt,23,The part of a complex category which omits the Head Weatures information constitutes the activepart of the sign.
E89-1034.txt,24,The f trst accessible sign in the active part is called the active sign_comma_ the idea being that e.g. verb valencies are ordered in a list so that each time a valency is consumed_comma_ the next sign in the active part becomes the new active sign.
E89-1034.txt,25,The Order attribute places constraints on the combination rule that may apply to a functor pre on an argument sign Y indicates that the functor X Y must precede the argument_comma_ while post indicates that the functor must follow the argument.
E89-1034.txt,26,249Using terms and term unification_comma_ the forward version 1 of functional application can then be stated as follows.
E89-1034.txt,27,2 Forward Application Functor PhonologyF CategoryF PhonologyA CategoryA SemanticsA prc SemanticsF OrderF Argument PhonologyA CategoryA SemanticsA pie Result PhonologyF PhonologyA CategoryF SemanticsF OrderF were upper letters indicate Prolog variables.
E89-1034.txt,28,In effect_comma_ the rule requires that the active part of the functor sign term unifies with the argument sign.
E89-1034.txt,29,The Result is a sign identical to the functor sign_comma_ but where the complex category is stripped from its active part and where variables shared by the active part of the functor and the rest of the functor sign may have become ground as a result of the active part unifying with the argument.
E89-1034.txt,30,The resulting phonology consists of the phonology of the functor followed by the phonology of the argument.
E89-1034.txt,31,An illustrative combination is given in 3 below for the sentence Jean marche.
E89-1034.txt,33,4 a Jacques aime Marie.
E89-1034.txt,34,CO Alme t il Marie
E89-1034.txt,35,c Quel livre aime Jacques d A t il aim6 Marie
E89-1034.txt,36,All other arguments can also appear to the left or to the right of the verb under similar conditions.
E89-1034.txt,37,For example_comma_ a lexical non nominative NP can never be to the left of the verb_comma_ but critics and wh constituents can.
E89-1034.txt,38,5 a Marie aregard e Jacques with Marie Obj Co QueUe revue a regard e Jacques with Quelle revue Obj c Jacques l a regardte Second_comma_ there seems to be no clear regularities governing the relative ordering of a sequence of arguments.
E89-1034.txt,39,That is_comma_ assuming that only adjacent constituents may combine and taking the combinations leftto right_comma_ the combination pattern varies as indicated below of each example in 6 .
E89-1034.txt,40,Here again_comma_ the permissible distributions are influenced by factors such as the morphological class of the constituents and the verb mood.
E89-1034.txt,41,6 a Pierre donne h Marie un livre.
E89-1034.txt,46,For example_comma_ clitics constrain the positioning and the class of other arguments as illustrated in 7 2 7 a Pierre le lui donne.
E89-1034.txt,47,Co Pierre lui en donne.
E89-1034.txt,48,c Pierre lui donne un livre. d Pierre lui le donne. e Pierre lui y donne.
E89-1034.txt,49,Since the ordering and the positioning of verb arguments in French are very flexible_comma_ the rigid ordeIn italics the word whose coocurrence restriction is violated starred sentences or obeyed non starred sentences .
E89-1034.txt,50,For instance_comma_ 7d is starred because lu may not be followed by le.
E89-1034.txt,51,250ring forced by the UCG active list and the fixed positioning resulting from the Order attribute are rather inadequate.
E89-1034.txt,52,On the other hand_comma_ word order in French is not free either.
E89-1034.txt,53,Rather it seems to be governed by conditional ordering statements such as 8 IF a the verb has an object valency_comma_ and Co the object NP is a wh constituent_comma_ and c the verbal constituent is the simple inflected verb_comma_ and d the clitic t il elle has not been incorporated THEN the object can be placed to the left or to the right of the verb.
E89-1034.txt,54,If say_comma_ 8d is not fulfilled_comma_ the wh NP can be placed only to the left_comma_ witness Jacques a t il regard quelle revue _comma_ and mutatis mutandis for the other conditions.
E89-1034.txt,55,More generally_comma_ five elements can be isolated whose interaction determine whether or not a given argument can occupy a given position in the sentence.
E89-1034.txt,56,9 a Position left or right with regard to the verb_comma_ Co Verbal form and sentence type_comma_ c Morphological class lexical_comma_ wh constituent or clitic of the previous constituent having concatenated to the left or to the right of the verb_comma_ d Morphological class of the current constituent lexical_comma_ wh constituent or clitic _comma_ e Case.
E89-1034.txt,57,We claim that it is possible to extend UCG in order to express the above conditioning variables.
E89-1034.txt,58,The resulling grammar can account for the preceding linguistic facts without resorting either to lexical ambiguity or to jump rules 3.
E89-1034.txt,60,EXTENSIONS TO UCG To account for the facts presented in section 2_comma_ UCG has been modified in two ways.
E89-1034.txt,61,Firstly_comma_ the active part ofaverb category is represented as a set rather than a list.
E89-1034.txt,62,Secondly_comma_ a feature system is introduced which embodies the interactions of the different elements conditioning word order as described in 9 above.
E89-1034.txt,63,3.1 SIGN STRUCTURE AND COMBINATION RULE FROM AN ACTIVE LIST TO AN ACTIVE SET.
E89-1034.txt,64,To accomodate our analysis_comma_ the sign structure and the combination rule had to be slightly modified.
E89-1034.txt,65,In the French Grammar FG _comma_ a sign is as follows.
E89-1034.txt,66,XA jump rule as used in Baschung et al. 1986 _comma_ is of the form X Y_comma_ Y Z X Z.
E89-1034.txt,67,10 French Grammar Sign Phonology Category Features Semantics Optionality Order Semantics and Phonology are as in UCG.
E89-1034.txt,68,Optionality indicates whether the argument is optional or obligatory 4.
E89-1034.txt,69,The Category attribute differs from UCG in that i there are no Features associated with the Head and ii the active part of a verb is viewed as a set rather than as a list.
E89-1034.txt,70,The Features attribute is a list of features.
E89-1034.txt,71,In this paper_comma_ only those relevant to order constraints are mentioned.
E89-1034.txt,72,They are case_comma_ verb mood_comma_ morphological class of NP s i.e._comma_ lexical_comma_ clitic or wh constituent and last concatenation to the left Lastlefl or to the right Lastright .
E89-1034.txt,73,The latter features indicate the morphological status of the last concatened functorand are updated by the combination rule cf. 13 .
E89-1034.txt,74,For instance_comma_ the sign associated with Jean lui a donnd un livre will have lex as values for Lastlefl and Lastright whereas lui a donn un livre has lui and lex respectively.
E89-1034.txt,75,The Features attribute can be represented as in 11 below_comma_ where the same feature may occupy a different position in the feature list of different linguistic units_comma_ e.g._comma_ feature list of verb valencies and feature list of NP signs.
E89-1034.txt,77,12 The Order attribute Cdts pre Resfeat_comma_ Cdts post Resfeat_comma_ where Cdts and Resfeat are lists of feature values whose order and content are independent from those of the Features attribute.
E89-1034.txt,78,The intuition behind this is that functors i.e._comma_ type raised NP s are two sided i.e._comma_ they can combine to the left and to the right but under different conditions and with different results.
E89-1034.txt,79,The features in Cdts place constraints on the features of the argument while the features in Resfeat are inherited by the resulting sign.
E89-1034.txt,80,These effects are obtained by unifi4.
E89-1034.txt,81,In the rest of this paper_comma_ the Semantics and the Optionality attributes will be omitted since they have no role to play in our treatment of word order while Phonology will only be represented when relevant.
E89-1034.txt,82,251 cation of shared variables in the rules of combination.
E89-1034.txt,83,Omitting Semantics and Optionality attributes_comma_ the forward combination rule is as follows.
E89-1034.txt,85,The notion of combination relies on the idea that the active part of a verb is a set rather than a list.
E89-1034.txt,86,More precisely_comma_ given a type raised NP NP1 with category C C NP. where NP i is a valency sign_comma_ and a verb V1 with category slActSet where ActSet is a set of valency signs_comma_ NP1 combines with V1 to yield V2 iff NPi unifies with some NP valency sign in the active set ActSet of the verb.
E89-1034.txt,87,V2 is identical to V1 except that the unifying NP i valency sign has been removed from the active set and that some features in V1 will have been instantiated by the rule.
E89-1034.txt,88,Forward combination further requires ii that the two features in the condition list to pre unify with the Lastlefl and Vmood features of the argument the features conditioning post are ignored since they are relevant only when the functor combines backwards _comma_ and iii that the features of the resulting sign be as specified.
E89-1034.txt,89,Note in particular that the MClass of the resulting sign is the MClass of the argument_comma_ that Lastright which indicates the morphological class ofthelast sign to have combined with the verb from theright_comma_ is transmitted from the argument_comma_ and thatLastlefl is assigned as value the MClass of the functor.
E89-1034.txt,90,Features of the resuiting sign which are conditional on the combination order ate inherited from the Resfeat field.
E89-1034.txt,91,This percox In this figure_comma_ numbers inside square denote the following attribute.
E89-1034.txt,93,It is illustrated by 14 below where the sign S 1 associated with the clitic le combines with the sign for 2 regarde to yield a new sign 3 le regarde.
E89-1034.txt,95,When it combines by BC_comma_ the conditions onpost ensure that the argument has not combined with anything on its right and that it has mood imperative.
E89-1034.txt,96,In this way_comma_ all sentences in 15 are parsed appropriately.
E89-1034.txt,97,15 a I1 le hi donne.
E89-1034.txt,98,Co II lui le donne.
E89-1034.txt,99,c Donne le lui. d Donne lui le.
E89-1034.txt,100,The backward combination rule BC functions like FC except for two things.
E89-1034.txt,101,First_comma_ the argument must be to the left of the functor and second_comma_ the condition field considered is that ofpost rather than ofpre.
E89-1034.txt,102,There is also a deletion rule to eliminate optional valencies.
E89-1034.txt,103,No additional rule is needed.
E89-1034.txt,104,3.2 EXPRESSING THE VARIABLES UNDERLYING WORD ORDER CONSTRAINTS In our grammar_comma_ there are nopost andpre primitive values associated with specific verb valencies.
E89-1034.txt,105,Instead_comma_ features interact with combination rules to enforce the 252 constraints on word order described in 9 .
E89-1034.txt,106,9a is captured in the two sided order field.
E89-1034.txt,107,9b verb mood and 9c morphological class of preceding concatenating functor are accounted for in that in a functor_comma_ the features conditioning order include the verb mood and the last concatenation attribute.
E89-1034.txt,108,9d is accounted for in that conditions which are invariant for a particular class of constituent clitic_comma_ wh constituent_comma_ lexical NP are expressed in the Order field of these constituents.
E89-1034.txt,109,For example_comma_ wh constituents reject through their conditions topre a wh value for the Lastlefl feature of the argument and an inv16 value in their condition to post.
E89-1034.txt,110,As a result_comma_ the following sentences are parsed appropriately.
E89-1034.txt,111,16 a A qui qui a ttltphon6
E89-1034.txt,112,Co A t il t ltphon6 a qui
E89-1034.txt,113,c A qui a t il ttltphon6 d I1 a ttltphone a qui
E89-1034.txt,114,Conditions which vary depending on the class of the concatenating constituent are expressed in the Features attribute of the verb valencies.
E89-1034.txt,115,This allows us to express constraints on the position of a given type of NP lex_comma_ wh or clitic relative to the valency it consumes.
E89-1034.txt,116,For instance_comma_a lexical NPcan be subject or object.
E89-1034.txt,117,If it is subject and it is to the left of the verb_comma_ it cannot be immediately followed by a wh constituent.
E89-1034.txt,118,If it is subject and it is placed to the right of the verb_comma_ it must be immediately adjacent to it.
E89-1034.txt,119,These constraints can be stated using unification along to the following lines.
E89-1034.txt,121,They state constraints_comma_ among others_comma_ on possible values ofLastlefl andLastright features of the verb.
E89-1034.txt,122,Recall that a valency is a sign which is a member of a set in the Category attribute of a verbal sign.
E89-1034.txt,124,Being shared variables_comma_ they transmit the information to the Conditions on concatenation by FC pre and BC post _comma_ respectively.
E89-1034.txt,125,Furthermore_comma_ V1 and V2 in the Ord attribute of the functor must unify_comma_ by rule_comma_ with some specified features in the verb Features attribute represented in 19 .
E89-1034.txt,126,The value nvl for the Lastlefl feature of a verb resulm from a backward combination of the nominative elitic t il with this verb.
E89-1034.txt,128,20a and 20c _comma_ which express the Category and theFeatures attibutes of the same verbal sign_comma_ have been dissociated for the sake of clarity.

E89-1034.txt,136,IMPLEMENTATION The UCG formalism and the corresponding computational environment were developped at the Centre for Cognitive Science_comma_ University of Edinburgh by Calderetal. 1986 .
E89-1034.txt,137,They include facilities for defining templates and path equations as in PATR 2 and a shiftreduce parser.
E89-1034.txt,138,The extensions to the original framework have been implemented at the Universit6 Blaise 253 Pascal_comma_ Formation Doctorale Linguistique et Informatique_comma_ Clermont Ferrand France .
E89-1034.txt,139,The system runs on a Sun and has been extensively tested.
E89-1034.txt,141,COVERAGE AND DISCUSSION The current grammar accounts for the core local linearity phenomena of French i.e._comma_ auxiliary and clitic order_comma_ clitic placement in simple and in complex verb phrases_comma_ clitic doubling and interrogative inversions.
E89-1034.txt,142,Unbounded dependencies are catered for without resorting either to threading COCG _comma_ functional uncertainty Karttunen or functional composition Combinatory Categorial Grammar_comma_ Steedman 1986 .
E89-1034.txt,143,Instead_comma_ the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducing an embedding valency on matrix verbs.
E89-1034.txt,144,Finally_comma_ non local order constraints such as constraints on the distribution of negative particles and the requirement for a wh constituent to be placed to the left of the verb when a lexical subject is placed to the right see example 22d can also be handled.
E89-1034.txt,145,Thus_comma_ it appears that insights from phrase structure and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together in a lexical framework.
E89-1034.txt,146,Following GPSG_comma_ our formalism does not associate verb valencies with any intrinsic order.
E89-1034.txt,147,An interesting difference however is that LP statements are not used either.
E89-1034.txt,148,This is important since in French_comma_ clitic ordering B s 1988 shows that order constraints may hold between items belonging to different local trees.
E89-1034.txt,149,Another difference with GPSG is that as in UCG_comma_ no explicit statement of feature instantiation principles is required the feature flow of information is ensured by the concatenation rules.
E89-1034.txt,150,Last but not least_comma_ it is worth underlining that our approach 1 keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 plus a unary deletion rule and 2 eliminates unjustified lexical ambiguity i.e._comma_ ambiguity not related to categorial or semantic information on the other hand.
E89-1034.txt,151,Though there are or so we argue good linguistic reasons for representing verb valencies as a set rather than as a list_comma_ it is only fair to stress that this rapidly leads to computational innefficiency while parsing.
E89-1034.txt,152,Typically_comma_ given 3 adjacent signs NP 1 V NP2 there will be two ways of combining each NP with the verb and thus two parses.
E89-1034.txt,153,In a more complex sentence_comma_ so called spurious ambiguities i.e._comma_ analyses which yield exactly the same sign multiply very quickly.
E89-1034.txt,154,We are currently working on the problem. .
E89-1027.txt,1,topic of the paper is the . of a formalism that permits a homogeneous representation of definite temporal adverbials_comma_ temporal quantifications as frequency and duration _comma_ temporal conJ ctions and tenses_comma_ and of their combinations with propositions. This unified representation renders it possible to show how these components refer to each other and interact in creati temporal meanings.
E89-1027.txt,2,The formal representation is 0ased on the notions phase set and phase operator _comma_ and it involves an interval logic.
E89-1027.txt,3,Furthermore logical coz uections are used_comma_ but the always troublesome logical quantifications may be avoided.
E89-1027.txt,4,The expressions are rather near to lingaistic structures_comma_ which facilitates the link to text analysis.
E89-1027.txt,5,Some emprical confirmations are outlined. q.
E89-1027.txt,6,THE GENERAL FRAME This paper presents some results that have been obtained in the field of time and tense phenomena K Luze 1987 .
E89-1027.txt,7,In connection with this some links to text analysis_comma_ knowledge representation and q erence mechanisms have been taken into accoumt.
E89-1027.txt,8,The formalism presented here differs from what is under label of temporal logic on the market e. g. Prior 1967 _comma_ Aqviet Guenthner 1978 .
E89-1027.txt,9,Our main intention is to establish a calculus that is rather near to linguistic structures on one side for text analysis and to inference mechanisms on the other side.
E89-1027.txt,10,The whole formalism has integrating features_comma_ i. e. the following components are represented by the same formal means in a way_comma_ that it becomes easy and effective to refer the different components to each other The propositions and their validity with respect to time Definite temporal adverbials nex wee k _comma_ ever Tuesda2 Definite temporal qu uti ications as frequency three times and duration three hours _comma_ comparislon of frequencies_comma_ durations etc. Temporal conj ctlons Tenses and their different meanings.
E89-1027.txt,11,The unified representation renders it possible to observe how the components interact in creating temporal meanings and relations.
E89-1027.txt,12,Some details have to be left out here_comma_ e. g. the notion determined time and the axiomatic basis of the calculus.
E89-1027.txt,14,PHASE SETS AND PROPOSITIONS A phase p is an interval either unbounded or a span or a moment which a truth value denoted by q p is assigned to q p T p is considered as an affirmative phase. q p F p is considered as a denying phase.
E89-1027.txt,15,The intervals are subsets of the time axis U and never empty .
E89-1027.txt,16,A phase set P is a pair tP _comma_q3_comma_ where Pa is a set of intervals_comma_ and q the evalnation function assigns a truth value to each pe Pa.
E89-1027.txt,17,P has to fulfil the following consistency demand A For all p_comma__comma_p aP holds If p n p  _comma_ then q p  q P .
E89-1027.txt,18,A phase set P is called complete_comma_ iff the union of all phases of P covers U.
E89-1027.txt,19,Propositions R are replaced by complete phase sets that express the structured validity of R on the time axis U.
E89-1027.txt,20,Such a phase set_comma_ denoted by R _comma_ has to be understood as a possible temporal perspective of R. There are propositions that differ from each other in this perspective only Por I John sleeps in the dinin room one has several such perspectives He is sleeping there_comma_ he sleeps there because the bedroom is painted for some days _comma_ he sleeps always there.
E89-1027.txt,21,SO the phases of R are quite different_comma_ even with clear syntactic consequences for the underlying verb_comma_ The local adverbial may not be omitted in the second and third easel I skip here completely the following problems A more sophisticated application of nested phase sets for the representation of discontinuous phases in R the motivation of phases e. g. according to Vendler 1967 and their adequacy.
E89-1027.txt,23,PHASE 0PERATORS A phase operator is a mapping with phase sets as arguments and values.
E89-1027.txt,24,There are phase operators with one and with two arguments.
E89-1027.txt,25,A two place phaseoperator P O PI_comma_P 2 is characterized by the following properties B If P P O PI_comma_P2 _comma_ then P P _comma_ i. e. the set of intervals of the resulting phase set is the same as of the first argument C For each phase operator there is a characteristic condition that says how q p is defined by q1 p and P2 for all p P .
E89-1027.txt,26,This condition implies always that q p F follows from q1 p F.
E89-1027.txt,27,SO the effect of applying P O PI_comma_P 2 is that some T phases of PI change their truth value_comma_ new phases are not created.
E89-1027.txt,28,The characteristic conditions are based on wo place relations between intervals.
E89-1027.txt,29,Let rel _comma_ be such a relation.
E89-1027.txt,30,Then we define by means of tel q p according to the following scheme CD q P f T_comma_ if ql p T and there is a P2 G P with q2 P2 T and rel P2oP F otherwise 198We will use three phase opera ors and define their v uation functions in the following way by D s E P 0CC P1_comma_P2 rel P2_comma_p is the relation P2 and p overlap _comma_ i. e.

E89-1027.txt,32,F P PER P1_comma_P2 s rel P2_comma_p is the relation P2 contains p _comma_ i. e.
E89-1027.txt,33,P2 p G P NEX PI_comma_P2 s rel P2_comma_p is the relation P2 and p are not seperated from each other _comma_ i. e.
E89-1027.txt,34,P2uP is an interval.
E89-1027.txt,35,As an illustration we consider some examples.
E89-1027.txt,36,Needless to say that their exact represention requires further formal equipment we have not introduced yet.
E89-1027.txt,37,Typical cases for 0CC and PER ares 2 yesterda was bad weather.
E89-1027.txt,38,Overlapping of yesterday and a Tphase of bad weather . 3 John worked the whole evening.
E89-1027.txt,39,A T phase of evening is contained in a T phase of John works . for evening _comma_ yesterday cf. 7. There is only a slight difference between the characteristic conditions for 0CC and NEX NEX admits additionally only b EETS P2_comma_p and LEETS p_comma_p2 in the sense of Allen 1984 .
E89-1027.txt,40,Later will motivate that NEX is the appropriate phase operator for the conjunction when.
E89-1027.txt,41,Therefore_comma_ sentences of the form  R1_comma_ when R 2. cf. N _comma_ 0 will be represented by an expression that contains NEX R2 _comma_ Rfl as core.
E89-1027.txt,42,The interpretation is thaC nothing happens between a certain T phase of RI an a certain T phase of R2 if they do not overlap .
E89-1027.txt,43,The next operation we are going to define is a one place phase operator with indeterminate character.
E89-1027.txt,45,By alternation new phases may be create s alt P1 contains exactly those phases which one gets by joining all phases of P1 that are not seperated o 199 from each other and have the same value ql Pl .

E89-1027.txt,49,alt P I is the maximal levelling of the phase set PI 4.
E89-1004.txt,1,this paper a method for controlling the dialog in a natural language NL system is presented. It provides a deep modeling of information processing based on time dependent propositional attitudes of the interacting agents.
E89-1004.txt,2,Knowledge about the state of the dialog is represented in a dedicated language and changes of this state are described by a compact set of rules.
E89-1004.txt,3,An appropriate organization of rule application is introduced including the initiation of an adequate system reaction.
E89-1004.txt,4,Finally the application of the method in an NL consultation system is outlined. .
E89-1004.txt,5,The solution of complex problems frequently requires cooperation of multiple agents.
E89-1004.txt,6,A great deal of interaction is needed to identify suitable tasks whose completion contributes to attaining a common goal and to organize those tasks appropriately.
E89-1004.txt,8,An ambitious dialog system be it an interface_comma_ a manipulation system_comma_ or a consultation system which is intended to exhibit some of these capabilities should therefore consider these intentions in processing 1 The work described in this paper is part of the joint project WISBER_comma_ which is supported by the German Federal Ministery for Research and Technology under grant ITW8502.
E89-1004.txt,9,The partners in the project are Nixdorf Computer AG_comma_ SCS Orbit GmbH_comma_ Siemens AG_comma_ the University of Hamburg_comma_ and the University of SaarbrOcken. the dialog_comma_ at least to the extent that is required for the particular type of the dialog and the domain of application.
E89-1004.txt,13,This approach behaves sufficiently well in several isolated situations_comma_ but it fails to demonstrate a continuously adequate behavior in the course of a complete dialog.
E89-1004.txt,15,Hence_comma_ they cannot explain what happens when a want has been satisfied.
E89-1004.txt,16,In our approach we have enhanced the propositional attitudes by associating them with time intervals expressing their time of validity.
E89-1004.txt,17,This enables us to represent the knowledge about the actual state of the dialog and also about past states seen from the point of view of a certain agent and to express changes in the propositional attitudes 27 occurring in the course of the dialog and to calculate their effect.
E89-1004.txt,18,This deep modeling is the essential resource for controling the progress of the conversation in approaching its overall goal_comma_ and_comma_ in particular_comma_ for determining the next subgoal in the conversation which manifests itself in a system utterance.
E89-1004.txt,20,REPRESENTING PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES Knowledge about the state of the dialog is represented as a set of propositional attitudes.
E89-1004.txt,21,The following three types of propositional attitudes of an agent towards a proposition p form a basic repertoire KNOW The agent is sure that p is true.
E89-1004.txt,22,This does not imply that p is really true since the system has no means to find out the real state of the world.
E89-1004.txt,24,BELIEVE The agent believes_comma_ but is not sure_comma_ that p is true_comma_ or he she assumes p without sufficient evidence.
E89-1004.txt,25,WANT The agent wants p to be true.
E89-1004.txt,26,Propositional attitudes are represented in our semantic representation language IRS_comma_ which is used by all system components involved in semantic pragmatic processing.
E89-1004.txt,28,A propositional attitude is written as type agent prop time  type is an element of the set KNOW_comma_ BELIEVE_comma_ and WANT. The two agents relevant in a dialog system are the USER and the SYSTEM.
E89-1004.txt,29,In addition_comma_ we use the notion mutual knowledge .
E89-1004.txt,30,Informally_comma_ this means that both the user and the system know that prop is true_comma_ and that each knows that the other knows_comma_ recursively.
E89-1004.txt,31,We will use the notation KNOW MUTUAL prop ... to express that the proposition prop is mutually known by the user and the system.  prop is an IRS formula denoting the proposition the attitude is about.
E89-1004.txt,32,It may again be a propositional attitude_comma_ as in WANT USER KNOW USER x ... ... which means that the user wants to know x.
E89-1004.txt,33,The proposition may also contain the meta predicates RELATED and AUGMENT RELATED x means something which is related to the individual x _comma_ i.e._comma_ it must be possible to establish a chain of links connecting the individual and the proposition.
E89-1004.txt,34,In this general form RELATED iS only used to determine assumptions about the user s competence.
E89-1004.txt,35,For a more intensive application_comma_ however_comma_ further conditions must be put on the connecting links.
E89-1004.txt,37,These rules describe communicative as well as r oncommunicative actions_comma_ and specify how new propositional attitudes can be derived.
E89-1004.txt,38,Rules about the domain of discourse express state changes including the involved action.
E89-1004.txt,39,The related states and the triggering action are associated with time intervals so that the correct temporal sequence can be derived.
E89-1004.txt,40,Both classes of rules are represented in a uniform formalism based on the schema precondition action effect The precondition consists of patterns of propositional attitudes or states in the domain of discourse.
E89-1004.txt,41,The patterns may contain temporal restrictions as well as the meta predicates mentioned above.
E89-1004.txt,42,A precondition may also contain a rule description_comma_ e.g._comma_ to express that an agent knows a rule. The action may be either on the level of communication in the case of speech act triggering rules or on the level of the domain actions the dialog is about .
E89-1004.txt,43,However_comma_ there are also pure inference rules in the dialog control module their action part is void. The effect of a rule is a set of descriptions of states of the world and propositional attitudes which are instantiated when applying the rule yielding new entries in the system s knowledge base.
E89-1004.txt,44,We do not delete propositional attitudes or other proOSitions_comma_ i.e._comma_ the system will not rget them_comma_ but we can mark the time interval associated with an entry as being finished .
E89-1004.txt,45,Thus we can express that the entry is no longer valid_comma_ and it will no longer match a pattern with the time of validity restricted to NOW.
E89-1004.txt,46,CONTROL STRUCTURE So far_comma_ we have only discussed how the actual state of the dialog from the point of view of a certain agent can be represented and how changes in this state can be described.
E89-1004.txt,47,We still need a method to determine and carry out the relevant changes_comma_ given a certain state of the dialog_comma_ after interpreting a user utterance i.e._comma_ to decide which dialog rules may be tried and in which order .
E89-1004.txt,48,For reasons of simplicity we have divided the set of rules into three subsets each of them being responsible for accomplishing a specific subtask_comma_ namely gaining additional information inferable from the interrelation between recent information coming from the last user utterance and the actual dialog context.
E89-1004.txt,49,The combination of new and old information may_comma_ e. g._comma_ change the degree of certainty of some proposition_comma_ i. e._comma_ terminate an uncertain BELIEVE state and create a certain KNOW state with identical propositional content the consistency maintenance rule package . pursuing a global cognitive or manipulative goal this may be done either by trying to satisfy this goal directly_comma_ or indirectly by substituting a more adequate goal for it and pursuing this new goal.
E89-1004.txt,50,In particular_comma_ a goal substitution is urgently needed in case the original goal is unsatisfiable for the system _comma_ but a promising alternative is available the goal pursuit rule package . pursuing a communicative subgoal.
E89-1004.txt,51,If a goal can not yet be accomplished due to lack of information_comma_ this leads to the creation of a WANT concerning knowledge about the missing information.
E89-1004.txt,52,When a goal has been accomplished or a significant difference in the beliefs of the user and the system has been discovered_comma_ the system WANTS the user to be informed about that.
E89-1004.txt,53,All this is done in the phase concerned with cognitive goals.
E89-1004.txt,54,Once such a WANT is created_comma_ it can be associated with an appropriate speech act_comma_ provided the competent dialog partner be it the user or an external expert is determined the speech act triggerin rule package .
E89-1004.txt,55,There is a certain linear dependency between these subtasks.
E89-1004.txt,56,Therefore the respective rule packages are applied in a suitable sequential order_comma_ whereas those rules belonging to the same pack 29 age may be applied in any order there exist no interrelations within a single rule package .
E89-1004.txt,57,This simple forward inferencing works correctly and with an acceptable performance for the actual coverage and degree of complexity of the system.
E89-1004.txt,58,A sequence consisting of these three subtasks forms a cognitive processing cycle of the system from receiving a user message to initiating an adequate reply.
E89-1004.txt,59,This procedure is repeated until there is evidence that the goal of the conversation has been accomplished as indicated by knowledge and assumptions about the user s WANTS or that the user wants to finish the dialog.
E89-1004.txt,60,In either case the system closes the dialog.
E89-1004.txt,61,APPLICATION IN A CONSULTATION SYSTEM In this section we present the application of our method in the NL consulration system WISBER involving rather complex interaction with subdialogs_comma_ requests for explanation_comma_ recommendations_comma_ and adjustment of proposals.
E89-1004.txt,62,However_comma_ it is possible to introduce some simplifications typical for consulration dialogs.
E89-1004.txt,63,These are urgently needed in order to reduce the otherwise excessive amount of complexity.
E89-1004.txt,64,In particular_comma_ we assume that the user does not lie and take his her assertions about real world events as true the sincerity condition .
E89-1004.txt,65,Moreover_comma_ we take it for granted that the user is highly interested in a consultation dialog and_comma_ therefore_comma_ will pay attention to the conversation on the screen so that it can be reasonably assumed that he she is fully aware of all utterances occurring in the course of the dialog.
E89-1004.txt,66,Based on these implicit expectations_comma_ the following simplified assumptions 1 and 2 represent the starting point for a consultation dialog 1 BELIEVE SYSTEM WANT USER EXIST X STATE X HAS EXPERIENCER X USER NOW NOW 2 BELIEVE SYSTEM KNOW USER RELATED EXIST Y STATE Y HAS EXPERIENCER Y USER NOW NOW They express that the user knows something that has to do expressed by the meta predicate RELATED with states STATE Y concerning him herself and that he she wants to achieve a state STATE X .
E89-1004.txt,67,In assumption 1_comma_ STATE X is in fact specialized for a consultation system as a real world state instead of a mental state which is the general assumption in any dialog system .
E89-1004.txt,68,This state can still be made more concrete when the domain of application is taken into account In WISBER_comma_ we assume that the user wants his her money to be invested. The second assumption expresses a part of the competence of the user.
E89-1004.txt,69,This is not of particular importance for many other types of dialog systems.
E89-1004.txt,71,In the course of the dialog these assumptions are supposed to be confirmed and_comma_ moreover_comma_ their content is expected to become more precise.
E89-1004.txt,72,In the subsequent paragraphs we outline the processing behavior of the system by explaining the application and the effect of some of the most important dialog rules at least one of each of the three packages introduced in the previous section _comma_ thus giving an impression of the system s coverage.
E89-1004.txt,73,In the rules presented below_comma_ variables are suitably quantified as they appear for the first time in the precondition.
E89-1004.txt,74,In subsequent appearences they are referred to like constants.
E89-1004.txt,75,The interpretation of the special constants denoting time intervals depends on whether they occur on the left or on the right side of a rule in the precondition the associated state event must hold occur during PAST_comma_ FUTURE or overlaps NOW in the effect the state event is associated with a time interval that starts at the reference time interval.
E89-1004.txt,76,In a consultation dialog_comma_ the user s wants may not always express a direct request for information_comma_ but rather refer to events and states in the real world.
E89-1004.txt,77,From such user wants the system must derive requests for knowledge useful when attempting to satisfy them.2 Consequently the task of infer 30 KNOW MUTUAL WANT USER EXIST A ACTION A NOW NOW A KNOW SYSTEM UNIQUE R AND RULE R HAS ACTION R A HAS PRECONDITION R EXIST 51 STATE 51  HAS EFFECT R EXIST 2 STATE 52  NOW  KNOW MUTUAL WANT USER 51 NOW NOW A KNOW MUTUAL R NOW A KNOW MUTUAL WANT USER s2 NOW NOW Rule 1 Inference drawn from a user want referring to an action with unambiguous consequences pursuing a global goal ring communicative goals is of central importance for the functionality of the system.
E89-1004.txt,78,There is_comma_ however_comma_ a fundamental distinction whether the content of a want refers to a state or to an event to be more precise_comma_ to an action_comma_ mostly .
E89-1004.txt,79,In the latter case some important inferences can be drawn depending on the domain knowledge about the envisioned action and the degree of precision expressed in its specificatiqn.
E89-1004.txt,80,If_comma_ according to the system s domain model_comma_ the effect of the specified action is unambiguous_comma_ the user can be expected to be familiar with this relation_comma_ so he she can be assumed to envision the resulting state and_comma_ possibly_comma_ the precondition as well_comma_ if it is not yet fulfilled.
E89-1004.txt,81,Thus_comma_ in principle_comma_ a plan consisting of a sequence of actions could be created by application of skillful rule chaining.
E89-1004.txt,82,This is exactly what Rule 1 asserts Given the mutual knowledge that the user wants a certain action to occur_comma_ and the system s knowledge in form of a unique rule about the associated precondition and effect_comma_ the system concludes that the user envisions the resulting state and he she is familiar with the connecting causal relation.
E89-1004.txt,84,Otherwise the user has to be asked to precise his her intention.
E89-1004.txt,85,Let us suppose_comma_ to give an example_comma_ that the user has expressed a want to invest his her money.
E89-1004.txt,86,According to WISBER s domain model_comma_ there is only one matching domain rule expressing that the user has to possess the money before but not after investing his her money_comma_ and obtains_comma_ in exchange_comma_ an asset of an equivalent value.
E89-1004.txt,87,Hence Rule 1 fires.
E89-1004.txt,88,The want expressed by the second part of the conclusion can be immediately satisfied as a consequence of the user utterance I have inherited 40 000 DM by applying Rule 5 which will be explained later .
E89-1004.txt,89,The remainder part of the conclusion matches almost completely the precondition of Rule 2.
E89-1004.txt,90,This rule states If the user wants to achieve a goal state G and is informed about the way this can be done he she knows the specific RULE R and is capable of performing the relevant action _comma_ the system is right to assume that the user is lacking some information which inhibits him her from actually doing it.
E89-1004.txt,91,Therefore_comma_ a want of the user indicating the intention to know more about this transaction is created expressed by the meta predicate AUGMENT .
E89-1004.txt,92,If the necessary capability cannot be attributed to the user a consultation is impossible.
E89-1004.txt,93,If_comma_ to discuss another example_comma_ the user has expressed a want aiming at a cer KNOW MUTUAL WANT USER EXIST S STATE S NOW NOW A KNOW MUTUAL UNIQUE R AND RULE R HAS EFFECT R S HAS ACTION R EXIST A ACTION A  NOW A KNOW MUTUAL CAPABILITY USER A NOW  BELIEVE SYSTEM WANT USER KNOW USER AUGMENT S FUTURE NOW NOW Rule 2 Inference drawn from a user want referring to a state_comma_ given his her acquaintance with the associated causal relation pursuing a global goal rain state e.g._comma_ I want to have my money back _comma_ the application of another rule almost identical to Rule 1 is attempted.
E89-1004.txt,94,When its successful application yields the association of a unique event_comma_ the required causal relation is established.
E89-1004.txt,95,Moreover_comma_ the user s familiarity with this relation must be derivable in order to follow the path indicated by Rule 2.
E89-1004.txt,96,Otherwise_comma_ a want of the user would be created whose content is to find out about suitable means to achieve the desired state as expressed by Rule 3_comma_ leading to a system reaction like_comma_ e.g._comma_ you must dissolve your savings account .
E89-1004.txt,97,It is very frequently the case that the satisfaction of a want cannot immediately be achieved because the precision of its specification is insufficient.
E89-1004.txt,98,When the domain specific problem solving component indicates a clue about what information would be helpful in this respect this triggers the creation of a system want to get acquainted with it.
E89-1004.txt,99,Whenever the user s uninformedness in a particular case is not yet proved_comma_ and this information falls into his her competence area_comma_ control is passed to the generation component to address a suitable question to the user as expressed in Rule 4 .
E89-1004.txt,100,Provided with new information hopefully obtained by the user s reply the system tries again to satisfy the more precisely specified user want.
E89-1004.txt,101,This process is repeated until an adequate degree of specification is achieved at some stage.
E89-1004.txt,102,KNOW MUTUAL WANT USER EXIST G STATE G NOW NOW A KNOW SYSTEM EXIST R AND RULE R HAS EFFECT R G HAS PRECONDITION R EXIST S STATE S  HAS ACTION R EXIST A ACTION A  NOW A  KNOW USER R NOW  BELIEVE SYSTEM WANT USER KNOW USER R FUTURE NOW NOW Rule 3 Inference drawn from a user want referring to a state_comma_ missing his her acquaintance with the associated causal relation pursuing a global goal 32 WANT SYSTEM KNOW SYSTEM X FUTURE NOW A BELIEVE SYSTEM KNOW USER RELATED X NOW NOW A I KNOW SYSTEM 1 KNOW USER x NOW NOW ASK SYSTEM USER x KNOW MUTUAL WANT SYSTEM KNOW SYSTEM X FUTURE NOW NOW A KNOW MUTUAL BELIEVE SYSTEM KNOW USER RELA TED X NOW NOW NOW Rule 4 Inference drawn from the user s assumed competence and a system want in this area triggering a speech act In the course of the dialog each utterance effects parts of the system s current model of the user concerning assumptions or temporarily established knowledge .
E89-1004.txt,103,Therefore_comma_ these effects are checked in order to keep the data base consistent.
E89-1004.txt,104,Consider_comma_ for instance_comma_ a user want aiming at investing some money which_comma_ after a phase of parameter assembling_comma_ has led to the system proposal I recommend you to buy bonds apparently accomplishing the substitued goal of obtaining enough information to perform the envisioned action.
E89-1004.txt,105,Consequently_comma_ the state of the associated user want is subject to change which is expressed by Rule 5.
E89-1004.txt,106,Therefore_comma_ the mutual knowledge about the user want is modified by closing the associated time interval and the the user s want is marked as being finished and added to the new mutual knowledge.
E89-1004.txt,107,However_comma_ this simplified treatment of the satisfaction of a want includes the restrictive assumptions that the acceptance of the proposal is implicitly anticipated_comma_ and that modifications of a want or of a proposal are not manageable.
E89-1004.txt,108,In a more elaborated version_comma_ the goal accomplishment has to be marked as provisory.
E89-1004.txt,109,If the user expresses his her acceptance either explicitly or changes the topic thus implicitly agreeing to the proposal _comma_ the application of Rule 5 is fully justified.
E89-1004.txt,110,Apart from the problem of the increasing complexity and the amount of necessary additional rules_comma_ the preliminary status of our solution has much to do with problems of interpreting the AUGMENT predicate which appears in the representation of a communicative goal according to the derivation by Rule 2 The system is satisfied by finding any additional information augmenting the user s knowledge_comma_ but it is not aware of the requirement that the information must be a suitable supplement which is recognizable by the user s confirmation only .

E89-1004.txt,112,A relatively small set of rules has proved sufficient to guide basic consultation dialogs.
E89-1004.txt,113,Currently we are extending the set of dialog control rules to perform more complex dialogs.
E89-1004.txt,114,Our special interest lies on clarification dialogs to handle misconceptions and inconsistencies.
E89-1004.txt,115,The first steps towards handling inconsistent user goals will be an explicit representation of the interrelationships holding between propositional attitudes_comma_ e.g._comma_ goals being simultaneous or competing_comma_ or one goal being a refinement of another goal.
E89-1004.txt,116,A major question will be specifying the operations necessary to recognize those interrelationships working on the semantic representation of the propositional contents.
E89-1004.txt,117,As our set of rules grows_comma_ a more sophisticated control mechanism will become necessary_comma_ structuring the derivation process and employing both forward and backward reasoning. .
E89-1031.txt,1,Romance languages such as Italian_comma_ Spanish and Portuguese allow the subject to be erased in tensed clauses. This paper studies subject erasing in the framework of a text generation system for Italian.
E89-1031.txt,2,We will prove that it is first necessary to try to pronominalize the subject.
E89-1031.txt,3,Therefore_comma_ we are led to study the synthesis of subject and complement personal pronouns.
E89-1031.txt,4,In Romance languages_comma_ personal pronouns raise many syntactic problems_comma_ whose solution is complex in a generation system.
E89-1031.txt,5,We will see that pronominalization plays a fundamental role in the order in which the elements of a clause are synthesized_comma_ and consequently in the synthesis of this clause.
E89-1031.txt,6,Moreover_comma_ the synthesis of a clause must take into account the fact that subject erasing and the synthesis of complements are phenomena which depend on each other.
E89-1031.txt,7,The complex algorithm that must be used for the synthesis of a clause will be illustred in various examples.
E89-1031.txt,8,1 Presentation of the generation system In a generation system_comma_ two questions must be answered What to say in order to decide on the content of the message to be produced and How to say it producing the text which carries this content .
E89-1031.txt,9,We are interested only in the How to say it question.
E89-1031.txt,10,We have adapted for Italian the generation system developped by L.Danlos 1987a_comma_1987b which produces texts in French and English.
E89-1031.txt,11,This generator includes two components the strategic component and the syntactic component.
E89-1031.txt,12,1 The strategic component takes both conceptual and linguistic decisions.
E89-1031.txt,13,It selects a discourse structure which determines the order of information_comma_ the number and form of the Sentences of the text to be generated.
E89-1031.txt,14,It returns a text template which is a list of the form Sentl Punctl ... Semi Puncti ... Senm Puncm where Puncti is a punctuation mark and Senti a sentence template.
E89-1031.txt,15,For the sake of simplification_comma_ only sentence templates which are clause templates without adverbial phrases will be considered here.
E89-1031.txt,16,This means that adverbial phrases e.g. subordinate clauses and coordinations of sentence templates are put aside L. Danlos 1987b .
E89-1031.txt,17,In a clause template without adverbial phrases _comma_ which will be noted CI_comma_ the elements are in the canonical order. subject verb dir_object prep_object s In particular_comma_ the subject appears always before the verb although the subject can be placed after the verb in Italian Ha telefonato Gianni Gianni has phoned Subject verb inversion has been described by L.
E89-1031.txt,18,Rizzi 1982 as a phenomenon which is correlated with subject erasing.
E89-1031.txt,19,This approach may be suitable for an analysis system which has to identify the subject of a clause.
E89-1031.txt,20,However it is not for a generation system which has to synthesize an identified subject.
E89-1031.txt,21,This is an example of text template 1 CCI1 subject MAN1 verb amare Cdir_object MISS1 .
E89-1031.txt,22,CC12 subject MAN2 verb odiare Cdir_object MISS2 . It is made up of two clause templates Cll and C12.
E89-1031.txt,23,CI1 includes the tokens MAN1 and MISS1_comma_ C12 the tokens MAN2 and MISS2.
E89-1031.txt,24,These tokens may be defined as follows MAN1 PERSON MISS1 PERSON NAME Max NAME Lia SEX mase SEX fern MAN2 PERSON MISS2 PERSON NAME Ugo NAME Eva SEX masc SEX fern 2 The syntactic component synthesizes a text template into a text.
E89-1031.txt,25,From the text template 1 _comma_ it produces the following text if the verbs are conjugated in the present tense Max area Lia.
E89-1031.txt,26,Ugo odia Eva.
E89-1031.txt,27,Max loves Lia. Ugo hates Eva Given the following simplified text template_comma_ where the functional categories eg. CI_comma_ subject are omitted for the sake of readibility 2 MAN1 amare MISS2. MAN2 odiare MISS2 MANI love MISS2. MAN2 hate MISS2 the syntactic component synthesizes the first CI as Max area Eva.
E89-1031.txt,28,Max loves Eva 225 Then it synthesizes the second one according to the lefthand context_comma_ i.e. the first synthesized clause.
E89-1031.txt,29,Among other things_comma_ it computes that the second occurrence of MISS2 can be synthesized as a personal pronoun Max area Eva.
E89-1031.txt,30,Ugo la odia.
E89-1031.txt,31,Max loves Eva.Ugo hates her The different steps required for the synthesis of a personal pronoun will be described in section 5.1.
E89-1031.txt,32,In the same way_comma_ the synthesis of the simplified text template 3 MAN2 essere cauivo. MAN2 odiare MISS2 MAN2 be nasty. MAN2 hate MISS2 gives the following text in which the subject position is empty see section 5.2 Ugo d cattivo.
E89-1031.txt,34,Ugo is nasty. He hates Eva and the synthesis of the text template 4 MAN2 picchiare MISS2. MAN2 odiare MISS2 MAN2 beat MISS2. MAN2 hate MISS2 gives the following text_comma_ in which the subject position is empty and the direct object synthesized as a personal pronoun Ugo picchia Eva.
E89-1031.txt,36,Ugo beats Eva. He hates her 2 Synthesis of a dause template In a generation system producing texts in Romance languages_comma_ a syntactic component has to handle three different orders for the synthesis of a CI The order in which the elements appear in a CI this order is supposed here to be the canonical order .
E89-1031.txt,37,The order in which the elements of a C1 must be synthesized see below .
E89-1031.txt,38,The order in which the synthesized elements must be placed in the final clause eg. for Italian_comma_ subject verb inversion .
E89-1031.txt,39,This order will not be discussed here.
E89-1031.txt,40,The order in which the elements of a CI must be synthesized is determined by non local dependencies and cross dependencies L.Danlos F.Namer 1988_comma_ L.Danlos 1988 .
E89-1031.txt,41,A non local dependency is to be found when the synthesis of an element X depends on that of another element Y.
E89-1031.txt,42,A cross dependency is to be found when the synthesis of X depends on that of Y and when the synthesis of Y depends on that of X.
E89-1031.txt,43,For example_comma_ there is a cross dependency between the synthesis of a direct object and that of the verb 1.
E89-1031.txt,44,First_comma_ let us show that the synthesis of the direct object depends upon that of the verb.
E89-1031.txt,45,Consider the following text template 5 MAN1 e MISS1 essersi sposati ieri. MAN2 adorare MISS1. MAN1 and MISSI get married yesterday. MAN2 adore MISS1. The pronominalisation of the second occurrence of MISS 1 is attempted.
E89-1031.txt,46,The foreseen pronoun is la_comma_ which 1 Synthesizing a verb means conjugating it. is the feminine singular form of a direct object pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,47,This pronoun must be placed directly before the verb and must be elided into l since the verb adorare conjugated in the past begins with the vowel a.
E89-1031.txt,48,However_comma_ synthesizing the second occurrence of MISS1 as l leads to an ambiguous text Max e Lia si sono sposati ieri.
E89-1031.txt,49,Ugo l adorava. since 1 could also be the result of the elision of o_comma_ which is the masculine singular form of a preverbal direct object pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,50,The interpretation of this text is either . or Max and Lia got married yesterday.
E89-1031.txt,51,Ugo adored her.
E89-1031.txt,52,Max and Lia got married yesterday.
E89-1031.txt,53,Ugo adored him.
E89-1031.txt,54,The second occurrence of MISS1 must therefore be synthesized not as a personal pronoun_comma_ but as a nominal phrase Max e Lia si sono sposati ieri.
E89-1031.txt,55,Ugo adorava Lia.
E89-1031.txt,56,Max and Lia got married yesterday. Ugo adored Lia. This example shows 1 that the synthesis of the direct object depends upon that of the verb_comma_ 2 that elision_comma_ which is a morphological operation_comma_ could not be handled in the final step of the syntactic component of the generator.
E89-1031.txt,57,On the other hand_comma_ the synthesis of the verb depends on that of the direct object_comma_ since a verb conjugated in the perfect tense agrees in number and gender with the direct object if the latter is synthesized as a preverbal pronoun I ragazzi sono morti.
E89-1031.txt,58,Ugo li ha uccisi The boys are dead. Ugo killed them Le ragazze sono morte.
E89-1031.txt,59,Ugo le ha uccise The girls are dead. Ugo killed them The cross dependency between the verb and the direct object can be handled with the following sequence of partial syntheses 1 Partial synthesis conjugation of the verb_comma_ without taking into account a possible agreement between a past participle and a direct object pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,60,2 Synthesis of the direct object_comma_ eventually according to the first letter of the verb.
E89-1031.txt,61,3 Second partial synthesis of the verb gender agreement with the direct object_comma_ if a the verb is conjugated in a compound tense_comma_ b the direct object has been synthesized as a personal pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,62,The phenomena of non local and cross dependencies make that the synthesis of a CI requires a complex algorithm which has nothing to do with a linear processus where the elements of a CI are synthesized from left to right.
E89-1031.txt,63,We are going to show that the synthesis of the subject involves also a number of nonlocal and cross dependencies where pronominalization plays a fundamental role.
E89-1031.txt,64,2263 . to subject erasing First of all_comma_ it should be noted that subject erasing does not affect the other elements of the clause the verb_comma_ for example_comma_ always agrees with its subject even if erased.
E89-1031.txt,65,A subject can be erased only if it can be pronominalized since the synthesis of a subject token always comes under one of the three following cases 1 The token is neither pronominalizable nor erasable.
E89-1031.txt,66,2 It is both pronominalizable and erasable.
E89-1031.txt,67,3 It is pronominalizable but not erasable.
E89-1031.txt,68,In other words_comma_ there exists no CI in which the subject token is erasable yet not pronominalizable.
E89-1031.txt,69,1 In the text template 6 MISS1 e MISS2 tornare da Londra. MISS2 imparare l inglese. MISSI and MISS2 be back from London. MISS2 learn English the second occurrence of the token MISS2 can be neither pronominalized 2 a a Lia ed Eva sono tornate da Londra.
E89-1031.txt,70,Lei ha imparato l inglese.
E89-1031.txt,71,Lia and Eva are back from London. She has learnt English nor erased b Co Lia ed Eva sono tornate da Londra.
E89-1031.txt,72,Ha imparato l inglese.
E89-1031.txt,73,Lia and Eva are back from London. She has learnt English 2 In the text template 7 MISS2 tornare. MISS2 stare bene. MISS2 be back. MISS2 be well. the second occurrence of MISS2 can be either pronominalized a or erased b a Eva tornataJ. ei sta bene.
E89-1031.txt,74,Eva is back. She_comma_ she is well b Eva tornata.
E89-1031.txt,76,Eva is back. She is well The presence of the pronoun lei in the second clause of a marks insistence on the entity the pronoun represents.
E89-1031.txt,77,3 In the text template 8 MISS2 e MAN2 tornare da Londra. MISS2 mparare l inglese. MISS2 and MAN2 be back from London. MISS2 learn English. the second occurrence of MISS2 can be pronominalized a but not erased Co a Eva e Ugo sono tornati da Londra.
E89-1031.txt,78,Lei ha imparato l inglese.
E89-1031.txt,79,Eva and Ugo are back from London. She has learnt English 2 An asterisk placed in front of a text means that this text is unacceptable because ambiguous. b Eva e Ugo sono tornati da Londra.
E89-1031.txt,80,Ha imparato l inglese.
E89-1031.txt,81,Eva and Ugo are back from London. She he has leamt English From the three previous examples_comma_ it must be clear that there is no C1 in which a subject token is erasable yet no pronominalizable.
E89-1031.txt,82,Dialogue subject pronouns i.e. first and second person come under case 2 provided that the verb is not conjugated in the subjunctive 3.
E89-1031.txt,83,A verb conjugated in a non subjunctive form indicates always the number and person of its subject 4.
E89-1031.txt,84,As a result_comma_ a dialogue subject pronoun is always erased in non subjunctive clauses 9 Verrai domani.
E89-1031.txt,85,You will come tomorrow unless the speaker wishes to insist on the entity the pronoun represents 10 Tu verrai domani.
E89-1031.txt,86,You_comma_ you will come tomorrow On the other hand_comma_ third person singular subject pronouns come under either case 1 or case 2 or case 3.
E89-1031.txt,87,For human entities_comma_ there are two pronominal forms_comma_ one masculine lui_comma_ and the other feminine lei 5.
E89-1031.txt,88,For non human entities_comma_ there are also two singular pronominal forms esso masculine and essa feminine .
E89-1031.txt,89,Therefore erasing one of these four forms entails the loss of information about both the gender of the subject and its human nature i.e. human or non human .
E89-1031.txt,90,This loss of information can give rise to ambiguity.
E89-1031.txt,91,Third person plural subject pronouns also come under either case 1 or case 2 or case 3.
E89-1031.txt,92,For human entities_comma_ there is one pronominal form loro used for both masculine and feminine.
E89-1031.txt,93,For non human entities_comma_ there are two forms essi masculine and esse feminine .
E89-1031.txt,94,Erasing a third person plural subject pronoun thus raises similar problems than erasing a third person singular subject pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,95,Therefore subject erasing will be illustrated only with third person singular token examples.
E89-1031.txt,96,3 Only clauses where the verb is conjugated in the indicative will be studied here.
E89-1031.txt,97,4L.Rizzi 1982 associates morphological properties i.e. number person to the verbal suffix.
E89-1031.txt,98,These properties are activated when the subject position is empty.
E89-1031.txt,99,The suffix then acts as subject pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,100,5 Two other forms can be used egli masculine singular and ella feminine singular .
E89-1031.txt,101,These forms have the same behaviour as lui and lei_comma_ they are simply used at a more literary stilistic level.
E89-1031.txt,102,Therefore only the forms lui and lei will be used in this paper.
E89-1031.txt,103,A sentential subject can be pronominalized as the pronoun ci6.
E89-1031.txt,104,The synthesis of sentential subjects will not be discussed here.
E89-1031.txt,105,227 4 Erasing a third person singular subject which can be pronominalized The subject pronoun is always erasable in examples such as 7 where the left hand context of the subject whose erasing is foreseen contains only one singular token.
E89-1031.txt,106,Apart from this trivial ease_comma_ let us examine when erasing a subject pronoun is possible_comma_ i.e. when information about the gender of the subject and its human nature are both recoverable.
E89-1031.txt,107,4.1 Recoverability of the human nature of the erased pronoun The human nature of an erased subject pronoun is recoverable when the verbal predicate lakes only a human subject or only a non human subject.
E89-1031.txt,108,In Ugo ha piantato un ciliegio.
E89-1031.txt,110,Ugo planted a cherry tree. It fructifies. the non human subject pronoun esso can be erased Ugo ha piantato un ciliegio.
E89-1031.txt,112,Ugo planted a cherry tree. It fructifies. since the verb fruttificare can take only a non human subject Ugo lui frunifica.
E89-1031.txt,113,On the other hand_comma_ in 0dgo he fructifies Ugo ha piantato un ciliegio.
E89-1031.txt,114,Esso ammirevole.
E89-1031.txt,115,Ugo planted a cherry tree. It is admirable. the pronoun esso cannot be erased Ugo ha piantato un ciliegio.
E89-1031.txt,117,Ugo planted a cherry tree. It he is admirable. since essere ammirevole takes both human and nonhuman subject Ugo lui questo ciliegio esso ammirevole. Ugo he this cherry tree it is admirable 4.2 Recoverability of the gender ofthe erased pronoun To study when the gender of the subject is recoverable_comma_ we will suppose that the human nature of the subject is recoverable.
E89-1031.txt,118,In the examples below_comma_ the verb predicate can take only human subjects.
E89-1031.txt,119,4.2.1 The gender of the erased pronoun is marked by another element of the clause If the gender of the subject pronoun whose erasing is foreseen is marked by another element of the clause_comma_ then erasing this pronoun does not give rise to ambiguity.
E89-1031.txt,120,Consider the discourses 11 and 12 in which erasing the feminine singular pronoun lei subject of the second clause is attempted l l Ugo non vedrh pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,121,Lei stata condannata all ergastolo.
E89-1031.txt,122,Ugo will not see Eva anymore. She s been condemned for life 12 Ugo non vedrd pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,123,Lei d in prigione per omicidio.
E89-1031.txt,124,Ugo will not see Eva anymore. She s in jail for murder Erasing the subject pronoun in 11 does not give rise to ambiguity_comma_ since the verb marks the gender of the subject 6.
E89-1031.txt,125,Ugo_comma_ which is masculine_comma_ is thus a prohibited antecedent.
E89-1031.txt,126,The only possible antecedent of the erased subject is Eva and the following discourse where lei is erased is unambiguous Ugo non vedr pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,127,E stata condannata all ergastolo.
E89-1031.txt,128,Ugo will not see Eva anymore. She s been condemned for life On the other hand_comma_ if the pronoun lei is erased in 12 _comma_ the information about subject gender is lost since neither the verb nor any other element of the clause indicates it.
E89-1031.txt,129,The antecedents of the erased subject are Ugo and Eva.
E89-1031.txt,130,The following discourse where lei is erased is ambiguous Ugo non vedr pi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,131,E in prigione per omicidio.
E89-1031.txt,132,Ugo will not see Eva anymore. He she is in jail for murder Subject pronoun erasing is therefore prohibited.
E89-1031.txt,133,The elements of a clause that mark the subject gender are the following either a nominal or adjectival attribute which is inflected for genderT Ugo non vedr pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,134,E troppo cattivo Ugo will not see Eva anymore. He is too nasty or the verb_comma_ if it satisfies one of the following conditions a it is conjugated in the passive see example 11 b it is conjugated in a compound tense with the verb essere be Ugo non vedrit pid Eva.
E89-1031.txt,135,E andata in Giappone.
E89-1031.txt,136,Ugo will not see Eva anymore. She s gone to Japan C it is conjugated in a compound tense at the pronominal voice_comma_ for example because there is a reflexive pronoun Ugo non baller con Eva stasera.
E89-1031.txt,137,Si ferito.
E89-1031.txt,138,Ugo will not dance with Eva tonight. He s wounded himself 6 The suffix a of its past participle marks the feminine singular.
E89-1031.txt,139,Recall that a past participle agrees in gender and number with the subject when the verb is conjugated with the auxiliary essere be .
E89-1031.txt,140,7 Two classes of adjectives must be distinguished those which are inflected for gender_comma_ eg. cattivo mast.sing cattiva fern.sing. nasty and those which are not_comma_ eg. gentile masc. sing. fern. sing. nice Several classes of nouns must be also distinguished.
E89-1031.txt,141,228 4.2.2 The gender of the erased pronoun is computable from the synthesis of other elements of the clause We are going to show that erasing a subject pronoun depends on the synthesis of complements of the clause i.e. direct object and prep objects because of the constraint of no coreferentiality between a subject and a complement personal pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,142,This constraint is based on the fact that a complement which is coreferential to the subject is synthesized as a reflexive pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,143,Therefore_comma_ in a clause such as Eva le ha sparato Eva shot her _comma_ the indirect complement feminine singular personal pronoun le cannot be coreferential to the feminine singular subject Eva because if it were it would be a reflexive pronoun Eva si d sparata Eva shot herself .
E89-1031.txt,144,Let us illustrate the use of this constraint for erasing a subject pronoun with the following text 13 Eva stata uccisa da Ugo.
E89-1031.txt,145,Lui le ha sparato durante la notte.
E89-1031.txt,146,Eva was killed by Ugo. He shot her during the night In 13 _comma_ there is no subject attribute and the verb is conjugated with the auxilary avere have .
E89-1031.txt,147,Therefore the subject gender is only marked in the subject pronoun lu .
E89-1031.txt,148,However if this pronoun is erased_comma_ the resulting text is not ambiguous Eva stata uccisa da Ugo.
E89-1031.txt,149,Le ha sparato durante la notte.
E89-1031.txt,150,Eva was killed by Ugo. He shot her during the night The only interpretation the only possible antecedent of the erased subject is Ugo.
E89-1031.txt,151,The indirect complement pronoun le can only have a feminine singular antecedent_comma_ here Eva.
E89-1031.txt,152,The subject and this pronoun cannot be coreferent.
E89-1031.txt,153,Therefore the antecedent of the erased subject is the only other human which appears in the context Ugo.
E89-1031.txt,154,Similarly_comma_ consider text 14 14 Ugo non ama pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,155,Lui l ha abbandonata.
E89-1031.txt,156,Ugo does not love Eva anymore. He abandoned her The direct object pronoun l elided form of the masculine singular lo or of the feminine singular la does not indicate the gender of its antecedent.
E89-1031.txt,157,However_comma_ this gender is marked in the feminine past participle abbandonata s.
E89-1031.txt,158,The pronoun l thus refers to Eva.
E89-1031.txt,159,Since the antecedent to this pronoun is necessarily different from that of the subject_comma_ Eva cannot be an antecedent of the subject.
E89-1031.txt,160,Erasing the subject pronoun does not give rise to ambiguity Ugo non area pifi Eva.
E89-1031.txt,161,L ha abbandonata.
E89-1031.txt,162,138o does not love Eva anymore. He abandoned her 8 Recall that the past participle of a verb conjugated with the auxiliary avere agrees in gender and number with its direct object if this object is in preverbal position.
E89-1031.txt,163,5 Synthesis of a third person singular subject token Since a third person singular subject token can be synthesized as an empty element only if its pronominalization is possible_comma_ the synthesis of such a token will take place as follows If the token has never been mentioned see 5.1.b synthesis of a nominal phrase not described here Else check if pronominalizing it is allowed in this case_comma_ check if erasing it is allowed if it is_comma_ synthesis of an empty subject_comma_ else synthesis of a subject pronoun else redescription or repetition of the token not described here .
E89-1031.txt,164,We present below 1 the different steps to be gone through for the synthesis of a subject pronoun_comma_ and more generally_comma_ for the synthesis of a personal pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,165,2 the peculiar operations which are necessary in Italian for synthesizing a subject pronoun and erasing iL 5.1 Synthesis of a personal pronoun The list of operations required for the synthesis of a personal pronoun is as follows a If a token refers to the speaker s or the hearer s _comma_ it must be synthesized as a first or second person pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,166,The only operation to be performed is then the computation of this dialogue pronoun. b Otherwise_comma_ we consider synthesizing a token as a third person personal pronoun only if it has already been synthesized because it occurs in a previous clause template .
E89-1031.txt,167,In other words_comma_ we do not consider the left pronominalization phenomena 9.
E89-1031.txt,168,Determining whether a token which has already been synthesized has to be synthesized as a pronoun requires the following steps to be gone through 1 Compute the form of the foreseen pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,169,The form of a third person pronoun may depend on its syntactical position subject_comma_ direct object .... _comma_ on the number and human nature of the token this semantic information is given in the token definition and on the gender of the nominal phrase of the synthesis of the previous occurrence of the token.
E89-1031.txt,170,Gender in Italian is either masculine or feminine_comma_ and it is lexical and not 9 In fact_comma_ the left pronominalization phenomena do rarely take place in a system of text generation_comma_ except in the synthesis of the first sentence_comma_ as in Each time he feels bad_comma_ U o is preoccupied. where the pronoun he refers to Ugo_comma_ right hand antecedent see among others T.Reinhard 1883 .
E89-1031.txt,171,In the n th sentence_comma_ the left pronominalization is generally forbidden_comma_ as shown in the following example Max is feverish.
E89-1031.txt,172,Each time he feels bad_comma_ U8o is preoccupied.
E89-1031.txt,173,The pronoun he of the second sentence can only refer to Max left hand antecedent and not to Ugo right hand antecedent .
E89-1031.txt,174,As our study is concerned with the synthesis of the n th n 1 CI of a text template_comma_ we put aside left pronominalization phenomena.
E89-1031.txt,175,229 semantic information.
E89-1031.txt,176,Let us consider the following definition of the token TABLI TABL1  TABLE NUMBER 1 DEFINITE yes It can be synthesized as a feminine nominal phrase la tavola the table or as a masculine nominal phrase il tavolo the table .
E89-1031.txt,177,The gender of a pronoun is usually the same as the gender of the previous occurrence of the token 15 La tavola rotta.
E89-1031.txt,178,Ugo la ripara. ll tavolo rotto.
E89-1031.txt,179,Ugo Io ripara.
E89-1031.txt,180,The table is broken. Ugo repairs it T Compute the list L1 of tokens that have been synthesized in nominal phrases_comma_ the morphological features i.e. gender and number of which are compatible with the form of the foreseen pronoun provided by Step 1 .
E89-1031.txt,181,If L1 has only one element_comma_ go to step 5 with L3 L1 otherwise 3 Compute the sublist L2 of L1 that contains the elements that are semantically compatible with the foreseen pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,182,For the pronouns whose form indicates the human nature of the antecedent eg. the subject pronoun lui indicates a human antecedent _comma_ the semantically compatible tokens are those with the right human nature.
E89-1031.txt,183,Moreover_comma_ the semantic features of each non human token of L1 may be checked on with regard to the relevant constraints of the verb.
E89-1031.txt,184,For example_comma_ in The book is on the table.
E89-1031.txt,185,It was published yesterday. the subject of the verb publish used in the passive must be something publishable.
E89-1031.txt,186,This semantic information is not compatible with the token which represents the table_comma_ but only with the one which represents the book _comma_ the latter is thus the only element which is semantically compatible with the pronoun it.
E89-1031.txt,187,If L2 has only one element go to step 5 with L2 L3 otherwise 4 Compute the sublist L3 of L2 that contains the elements which are syntactically compatible with the foreseen pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,188,An example of coreferential syntactic incompatibility is the constraint of no coreferentiality between a subject and a complement personal pronoun see section 4.2.2 .
E89-1031.txt,189,Another one is the following constraint If a personal pronoun synthesizes the subject of a sentential clause which must be reduced to an infinitive form when its subject is equal to the subject of the main clause_comma_ then this pronoun does not refer to the subject of the main clause_comma_ because if it did_comma_ the sentential clause would be reduced to an infinitive form L.Danlos 1988 Mary i wants that Maryileaves  Maryiwants to leave.
E89-1031.txt,190,An illustration of this constraint is that in Mary wants that she leaves_comma_ the pronoun she cannot refer to Mary.
E89-1031.txt,191,5 As a first approach_comma_ if L3 contains one element_comma_ synthesizing a pronoun is possible since this synthesis involves no ambiguity.
E89-1031.txt,192,Otherwise the foreseen pronoun is not synthesized.
E89-1031.txt,193,Counting the number of elements in L3 is not enough in determining the possibility of synthesizing or not a pronoun pragmatical considerations_comma_ focus C.Sidner 1981_comma_ B.Grosz_comma_ 1982 and parallelism L.Danlos_comma_ 1987a are phenomena that must be taken into account.
E89-1031.txt,194,They are not studied here.
E89-1031.txt,195,As an illustration of these five steps_comma_ consider the following text template 16 MISS1 e MISS2 tornare. MAN2 dare un bacio a MISS2. MISSI and MISS2 be back. MAN2 give a kiss to MISS2 The synthesis of the second occurrence of MISS2 as a pronoun is attempted.
E89-1031.txt,196,1 The form of the preverbal dative pronoun is le_comma_ third person feminine singular.
E89-1031.txt,197,2 L1 contains the tokens which appear in the left hand context that have been synthesized as feminine singular nominal phrases_comma_ i.e.
E89-1031.txt,198,L1 MISS I_comma_ MISS2 .
E89-1031.txt,199,3 All the elements of L1_comma_ which are humans_comma_ are semantically compatible with the foreseen pronoun_comma_ so L2 L1.
E89-1031.txt,200,4 All the elements of L2 are syntactically compatible with the foreseen pronoun_comma_ so L3 L2.
E89-1031.txt,201,5 L3 contains more than one element_comma_ so the pronoun is not synthesized.
E89-1031.txt,202,The resulting discourse will be Lia e Eva sono tornate.
E89-1031.txt,203,Ugo ha dato an bacio a Eva.
E89-1031.txt,204,Lia and Eva are back. Ugo gave a kiss to Eva Another illustration is given by the following text template where TABL1 is supposed to be synthesized as the masculine nominal phrase il tavolo 17 MAN1 riparare TABL1. MAN2 dare un bacio a MAr t. MANI repair TABLI. MAN2 give a kiss to MAN1. The synthesis of the second occurrence of MAN1 as a pronoun is attempted 1 The form of the preverbal dative pronoun is gli_comma_ third person masculine singular.
E89-1031.txt,205,2 L1 contains the tokens of the left hand context that have been synthesized as masculine singular nominal phrases_comma_ i.e.
E89-1031.txt,206,LI MAN1_comma_ TABL1_comma_ MAN2 .
E89-1031.txt,207,3 TABL1_comma_ which is not human_comma_ is semantically incompatible with the pronoun gli since the dative complement of dare un bacio must be human_comma_ hence L2 MAN1_comma_MAN2 .
E89-1031.txt,208,4 MAN2_comma_ which is the subject of the second CI_comma_ is syntactically incompatible with gli because of the constraint of no coreferentiality between the subject and a complement personal pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,209,Hence L3f MAN1 .
E89-1031.txt,210,Since L3 contains only one element_comma_ the pronoun can be formed Max ha riparato il tavolo.
E89-1031.txt,211,Ugo gli ha dato un bacio.
E89-1031.txt,212,Max repaired the table. Ugo gave him a kiss 2305.2 Synthesizing and erasing an Italian subject pronoun The synthesis of an Italian subject pronoun follows the operations described above_comma_ except that erasing the pronoun is attempted at the same time_comma_ as shown below 1 A list L I is computed parallely to the computation of the list L1 see step 2 of the section 5.1 .
E89-1031.txt,213,L I contains the morphological antecedents of the foreseen erased pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,214,Two cases must be distinguished see section 4.2.1 a There is an element X in the clause which marks the subject gender see example 11 .
E89-1031.txt,215,In this case_comma_ L I contains third person singular tokens of the same gender as this pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,216,In other words_comma_ L I L1. b There is no element X which marks the gender of the pronoun whose erasing is foreseen see example 12 .
E89-1031.txt,217,The morphological antecedents are then the tokens of the third person feminine and masculine singular L I LI .
E89-1031.txt,218,If L I has only one element this means that LI has also only one element go to step 4 with L 3 L I otherwise 2 A sub list L 2 of L I is computed parallely to the computation of the list L2 step 3 of the section 5.1 .
E89-1031.txt,219,L 2 contains the tokens which are semantically compatible to the foreseen erased subject.
E89-1031.txt,220,If L 2 and hence L2 contains only one element_comma_ go to step 4 with L 2 L 3 otherwise 3 If the list L3 step 4 of the section 5.1 contains 10 _comma_ _comma_ only one element _comma_ the sub list L 3 of L 2 is computed.
E89-1031.txt,221,L 3 contains the tokens which are syntactically compatible to the foreseen erased subject.
E89-1031.txt,222,As shown in section 4.2.2_comma_ computing the list L 3 of the syntactic antecedents of the pronoun whose erasing is foreseen in a CI depends on the synthesis of other tokens in C1.
E89-1031.txt,223,4 Pronoun erasing is usually allowed if list L 3 contains only one element.
E89-1031.txt,224,6 Example of the synthesis of a dause template Consider the following text template_comma_ where LOC1 is to be synthesized as the nominal phrase il bosco the wood 18 MAN1 vedere MISS1 in LOCI. MAN1 abbracciare MISS1 MAN1 see MISSI in LOCI . MANI kiss MISS1 To begin with_comma_ suppose the verbs are conjugated in a compound tense i.e. perfect .
E89-1031.txt,225,The synthesis of the first CI is then Max ha visto Lia nel bosco.
E89-1031.txt,226,Max saw Lia in the wood 10 If L3 contains more than one element_comma_ the subject token is not pronominalizable and thus not erasable.
E89-1031.txt,227,Let us examine the synthesis of the second CI.
E89-1031.txt,228,First_comma_ a partial synthesis of the subject MAN1 is carried out.
E89-1031.txt,229,Since MAN1 has already been mentioned_comma_ both synthesizing this token as a pronoun and erasing this pronoun are attempted.
E89-1031.txt,230,6.1 First partial synthesis of the subject MANI 1 The form of the foreseen pronoun is lu _comma_ human masculine singular.
E89-1031.txt,231,2 The list L1 contains the tokens which appear in the left hand context that have been synthesized as masculine singular nominal phrases_comma_ i.e.
E89-1031.txt,232,LI MANI_comma_LOCI .
E89-1031.txt,233,The list L I contains the tokens that have been synthesized as both masculine and feminine nominal phrases_comma_ since there is no element in the CI which marks the subject gender so L I MAN1_comma_LOC1 _comma_MISS 1 .
E89-1031.txt,234,3 LOCI is semantically incompatible with the pronoun lui which can have only human antecedents.
E89-1031.txt,235,So L2 MAN1 .
E89-1031.txt,236,LOCI is also semantically incompatible with an erased pronoun since the subject of the verb abbracciare must be human_comma_ so L 2 MAN1_comma_MISS 1 .
E89-1031.txt,237,4 As L2 L3 MAN1 contains only one element_comma_ the synthesis of the pronoun lui is possible.
E89-1031.txt,238,The computation of L 3 depends upon the synthesis of other elements of the CI.
E89-1031.txt,239,Therefore the final synthesis of the subject i.e. the decision to erase the pronoun lui according to the number of elements of L 3 is postponed.
E89-1031.txt,240,6.2 First partial synthesis of the verb abbracciare This verb is conjugated at the third person singular of the perfect tense with the auxiliary avere.
E89-1031.txt,241,In this first partial synthesis of the verb the possible agreement with a direct object is postponed.
E89-1031.txt,242,Thus the result of this partial synthesis is the form ha abbracciato where the past participle is in the masculine singular form which is the default value.
E89-1031.txt,243,6.3 Synthesis of the direct object MISS1 The token MISS1 has been mentioned in the previous CI_comma_ so synthesizing it as a personal pronoun is attempted 1 Because of the conjugation of the verb_comma_ the feminine singular direct object pronoun la must be elided into l .
E89-1031.txt,244,2 The form l does not mark the gender.
E89-1031.txt,245,However_comma_ the gender of the pronoun la will be marked in the past participle of the verb which is conjugated with the auxiliary avere.
E89-1031.txt,246,Therefore_comma_ L1 contains the tokens that have been synthesized as feminine singular nominal phrases_comma_ i.e.
E89-1031.txt,247,LI MISS1 .
E89-1031.txt,248,Since L1 contains only one element_comma_ the pronoun l is synthesized.
E89-1031.txt,249,Let us underline that the synthesis of the pronoun l is based only upon morphological criteria and thus does not involve the constraint of no coreferntiality between the subject and a complement.
E89-1031.txt,250,Therefore this constraint can be used for the second and las0 partial synthesis of the subject as shown in 6.5. Q 231 6A Second and last partial synthesis of the verb Since the direct object pronoun 1 has been synthesized_comma_ the past participle agrees in gender and number with this pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,251,The final result of the synthesis of the verb is ha abbracciata where the past participle is in the feminine singular form.
E89-1031.txt,252,6.5 Second and last partial synthesis of the subject At this stage_comma_ the second CI of 18 is foreseen to be synthesized as either Lui l ha abbracciata or L ha abbracciata.
E89-1031.txt,253,The last step to be carried out is the computation of the sub list L 3 of L 2 MAN1_comma_MISS 1 to determine if the subject pronoun can be erased.
E89-1031.txt,254,Since the direct object MISS1 has been synthesized as the pronoun l only thanks to morphological criteria_comma_ the constraint of no coreferentiality between a subject and a direct object can be used to state that MISS1 is a syntactically incompatible antecedent for the foreseen erased subject pronoun.
E89-1031.txt,255,So L 3 contains only one element MAN1 and the subject pronoun can be erased.
E89-1031.txt,256,The synthesis of the second CI of 18 is L ha abbracciata.
E89-1031.txt,257,He kissed her Now_comma_ suppose that the verbs of 18 are conjugated in a simple tense eg. present and examine again the synthesis of the second CI.
E89-1031.txt,258,The reader will check that the direct object MISS1 can be synthesized as the pronoun l not thanks to morphological criteria there is no past participle but thanks to the constaint of nocoreferentiality.
E89-1031.txt,259,Therefore this constraint cannot be used again in computing L 3.
E89-1031.txt,260,Consequently L 3 L 2 MAN1_comma_MISS1 and the subject pronoun cannot be erased the synthesis of this C1 is Lui l abbraccia.
E89-1031.txt,261,He kisses her 7 Future research The sequential order of the operations for the synthesis of a C1 we have just described makes that the constraint of no coreferentiality is called on as a priority for the synthesis of a complement_comma_ and if not used for any complement_comma_ it is called on for subject erasing.
E89-1031.txt,262,Our future research L. Danlos_comma_ F. Namer_comma_ forthcoming leads us to design a more global approach in which the constraint of no coreferentiality is not called on as a priority for a complement.
E89-1031.txt,263,This approach will allow the second CI of 18 with the verb conjugated in the present to be synthesized not only as Lui l abbraccia but also as Abbraccia la ragazza.
E89-1031.txt,264,He kisses the gid where the subject is erased and the direct object not pronominalized because the constraint of nocoreferentiality is used for the subject and not for the complement.
E89-1031.txt,265,ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wish to thank Laurence Danlos for her constant help and her important contributions to the work reported here. .
E89-1006.txt,1,proposal to deal with French tenses in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory is presented_comma_ as it has been implemented for a fragment at the IMS. It is based on the theory of tenses of H.
E89-1006.txt,2,Kamp and Ch.
E89-1006.txt,4,Instead of using operators to express the meaning of the tenses the Reichenbachian point of view is adopted and refined such that the impact of the tenses with respect to the meaning of the text is understood as contribution to the integration of the events of a sentence in the event structure of the preceeding text.
E89-1006.txt,5,Thereby a system of relevant times provided by the preceeding text and by the temporal adverbials of the sentence being processed is used.
E89-1006.txt,6,This system consists of one or more reference times and emporal perspective imes_comma_ the speech time and the location time.
E89-1006.txt,7,The special interest of our proposal is to establish a plausible choice of anchors for the new event out of the system of relevant times and to update this system of temporal coordinates correctly.
E89-1006.txt,8,The problem of choice is largely neglected in the literature.
E89-1006.txt,9,In opposition to the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the exact meaning of the tenses is fixed by the resolution component and not in the process of syntactic analysis.
E89-1006.txt,11,On a Reichenbachian analysis tenses are interpreted as relating three kinds of temporal entities the time Of the event talked about_comma_ the speech time time of utterance and the refer The research was done in the context of ACORD ESPRIT P393 and LILOG_comma_ and was also supported by the German Science Foundation Ro245 13 3 ence time.
E89-1006.txt,12,In the original version these entities are understood as time points.
E89-1006.txt,13,In the sequel frequently this system was transformed into intervalbased approaches to describe the interaction of adverbials_comma_ tenses and aspect on sentence level cf. v.Eynde 1987 _comma_ Bras Sorillo 1988 or to describe the course of events on text level cf. Hinrichs 1986 _comma_ Partee 1984 l .
E89-1006.txt,14,A detailed criticism of the Reichenbachian analysis of tenses can be found in B uerle 1979 .
E89-1006.txt,15,Motivated by text phenomena the Kamp Rohrer approach 1983_comma_1985 splits the Reichenbachian reference time into three contextually given parameters by adding temporal perspective points and location times.
E89-1006.txt,16,Our approach which is based on the Kamp Rohrer analysis differs from treatments of the semantics of tenses and aspects which characterize the tenses by some simple operator usually interpreted as a temporal quantifier in that respect that the tenses are described in terms of their contribution to the problem of how the temporal structure of the events talked about can be constructed.
E89-1006.txt,17,The problem how to determine the times the context has to supply and to which the events have to be related is largely neglected in theoretical discussions of the semantics of tenses.
E89-1006.txt,18,It is the main topic of our discussion.
E89-1006.txt,19,Special attention has been paid to the interaction of tense_comma_ aspect and temporal adverbials in determining these relations.
E89-1006.txt,20,The approach represents a unified account of tense and aspects.
E89-1006.txt,21,Another problem dealt with is the problem of tense switch.
E89-1006.txt,22,We will restrict the discussion to French tenses prevailing in written reports about past events imparfait_comma_ pass simple_comma_ passd composd_comma_ plusqueparfait_comma_ conditionnel .
E89-1006.txt,23,The tense system x Partee has discussed at length the parallelism between nominal and temporal anaphora.
E89-1006.txt,24,The idea of tenses as anaphora_comma_ as developed there_comma_ underlies to a certain extent our approach as well.
E89-1006.txt,25,43 concerning the past_comma_ in contrast to that relating to the present or future time_comma_ is rather elaborated_comma_ especially in French.
E89-1006.txt,26,A proper theory of tenses has to account for this multiplicity.
E89-1006.txt,27,2 Representing events in DKT In the framework of Discourse Representation Theory DRT Kamp 1981 a Discourse Representation Structure DRS is a pair U_comma_ K consisting of a set U of discourse referents DRFs and a set K of conditions.
E89-1006.txt,28,Discourse Referents are assumed to be sorted according to the following sort system for our purposes only the temporal branch is relevant all_comma_ a temporal_comma_ t non temporal_comma_ x dynamic state_comma_ s event_comma_ e process_comma_ p We shall use the indicated letters for DRFs of the corresponding sort 2.
E89-1006.txt,29,Conditions take the following forms . .
E89-1006.txt,31,P al_comma_..._comma_ an _comma_ where P is an n ary predicate symbol and the ai are discourse referents.
E89-1006.txt,32,Conditions of this form are also called atomic.
E89-1006.txt,33,For 2 place temporal relations we will also use infix notation.
E89-1006.txt,34,DRS1  DRS2 t DRS_comma_ where t is a temporal DRF Thus DRT uses a variant of the Davidsonian method of talking about events they are treated as a kind of objects.
E89-1006.txt,35,But DRT deviates from the Davidsonian representation in that instead of using additional argument places in the predicates 2For simplicity we will use the term event not just for the corresponding subsort of dynamic but also for dynamic or temporal objects in general.
E89-1006.txt,36,For the same reasaa we do not make a clear distinction between aspect and Aktionsarten .
E89-1006.txt,37,The intended meaning should be clear from the context.
E89-1006.txt,38,The classification is related to the one given in VendieT 1967 . an event discourse referent is put before a DttS representing the nature of the event.
E89-1006.txt,39,This allows for a recursive definition of aspects and to account for aspectual change.
E89-1006.txt,40,So the process p of z s travelling would be written in DRT as and the event of x s travelling to Paris would be written as p x paris e p I travel x 1 goal p_comma_ paris DRSs containing conditions as these are embedded into models by mapping the temporal DRFs onto objects in a domain of temporal objects.
E89-1006.txt,41,A proper embedding is realized if the value of the eventDRF fulfills conditions represented by the sub DRS which the event introduces with respect to an interpretation function defined among other things on predicates such as travel in the example above.
E89-1006.txt,42,An advantage of this representation on the one hand is that_comma_ following the usual definition of accessibility of DRSs from a DRS used in DRT_comma_ restrictions on the accessibility of DRFs as possible antecedents for anaphoras can be expressed_comma_ though for our purposes this will play only a subordinate role.
E89-1006.txt,43,On the other hand different modes of existence can be discriminated for the objects DRFs stand for_comma_ depending on the position of the sub DRSs_comma_ where these DRFs are introduced_comma_ in the DRS of the whole text.
E89-1006.txt,44,In the case of reported speech for instance_comma_ the real existence of a reported episode is not necessary.
E89-1006.txt,45,Extensions of the original modeltheory ofDRT cf. Kamp 1981 which point in this direction are given e.g. in Asher 19S6 _comma_ Reyle 1985 _comma_ Eberle 1988b .
E89-1006.txt,46,3 Basic Assumptions of the Semantics of Tenses and Adverbials The basic tenses of French narrative texts are imparfait and pass simple.
E89-1006.txt,47,The interaction of these tense forms is often described by two pairs of opposition On the one hand the pass simple is used to describe actions of the narrative_comma_ the course of events _comma_ whereas the imparfait serves to paint the44background of the story.
E89-1006.txt,48,On the other hand the imparfait can be used to describe events in progress as viewed from inside _comma_ whereas the pass simple presents the event as a punctual entity.
E89-1006.txt,49,In order to reflect these dichotomies we require that an event introduced by pass simple serves as new reference time which must not start before the old one_comma_ and that the imparfait introduces a state which includes temporally the existing reference time.
E89-1006.txt,50,In this case no new reference time Is created.
E89-1006.txt,51,In the case of pass simple we do not require that the new reference time has to follow completely the old one in order to deal correctly with discourse situations as elaboration or contrast and others.
E89-1006.txt,52,To discriminate such textual functions an elaborate inference component is needed_comma_ which at present is not available.
E89-1006.txt,53,In addition there are cases where this inference component would need information about the proceeding of the whole story.
E89-1006.txt,54,This cannot be made available at this stage of processing.
E89-1006.txt,55,Thus an underspecified relation not before is necessary which can be defined_comma_ as other relations like subset needed for the imparfait _comma_ out of the relations overlap and before_comma_ the only basic temporal relations used in the system s .
E89-1006.txt,56,The plusqueparfait can be understood as perfective state giving background information with respect to the actual reference time of the story_comma_ Jean avait dgj mange _comma_ or as introducing or continuing a flashback.
E89-1006.txt,57,The conditionnel is understood as a counterpart to the plusqueparfait describing an anticipation with respect to a perspective point in the past.
E89-1006.txt,58,We think that pass compos in written narrative texts should be treated as analogue to the pass4 simple with respect to pure temporal relations 4 .
E89-1006.txt,59,Temporal adverbials provide a location time for events in relation to the temporal structure of the preceding text.
E89-1006.txt,60,They can differ from each other by their characterization of the location time and their anaphoric behavior.
E89-1006.txt,61,Deictic adverbials like demain_comma_ ia semaine derni re for instance create location times of different temporal extension with different ordering conditions regarding the evaluation time after and before _comma_ but they are similar in that the evaluation time must be the speech 3For motivations and definitions cf.
E89-1006.txt,62,Kamp 1979 _comma_ Reyle l 6 _comma_ Eberle 1988b .
E89-1006.txt,63,4 For a more elaborate discussion of the French tense system cf.
E89-1006.txt,64,Kamp Rohrer 1985 _comma_ Eberle 1988c . time_comma_ whereas in case of le lendemain_comma_ la semaine prdcddante the temporal relations and extensions are equivalent to the deictic analogues but the time of evaluation has to be a past reference time or perspective point.
E89-1006.txt,65,Frame time adverbials like ce jourla can be distinguished from punctual time adverbials like fi trois heures and from adverbials_comma_ like puis_comma_ which simply state a temporal relation between the event to be introduced and a temporal antecedent.
E89-1006.txt,66,Some adverbials_comma_ like puis and ensuite_comma_ do not restrict the nature of the antecedent_comma_ it is just a reference time.
E89-1006.txt,67,But maintenant e.g. requires that the evaluation time is a perspective point of the text.
E89-1006.txt,68,The resolution component has to take into account such phenomena.
E89-1006.txt,69,4 Aspects of Implementation 4.1 Architecture The construction of the semantic representation for a discourse proceeds in several stages each sentence is parsed using a Lexical Functional Grammar LFG Kaplan Bresnan 1982 _comma_ Eisele DSrre 19S6 which analyzes sentences into functional structures f structures _comma_ augmented by indices to indicate the linear order of words in the input string.
E89-1006.txt,70,The f structure serves as input for the construction of a proto semantic representation cf. Reyle 1985 _comma_ Reinhardt Kasper 1987 .
E89-1006.txt,71,The last stage consists in integrating this representation into a semantic representation for the discourse_comma_ mainly by doing the necessary resolutions for anaphoric expressions.
E89-1006.txt,72,Accordingly_comma_ the system consists of three major modules LFG Parser I f structure Composer I Proto DRS DRS Knowledge base The whole system is implemented in PROLOG.
E89-1006.txt,73,Here mainly the Composer and the Resolver will be discussed with respect to the treatment45of the tenses in these modules.
E89-1006.txt,74,The inference machine and knowledge base are at present not implemented.
E89-1006.txt,75,The proto semantic representation for a sentence built up by the Composer differs from the semantic representation proper in that it not just contains the semantic information available from the sentence but also morpho syntactic information from the f structure needed to constrain the resolution process.
E89-1006.txt,76,Thereby_comma_ this information is passed to the Resolver which separates semantic and syntactic information and uses it.
E89-1006.txt,77,What sort of morphosyntactic information is passed will be discussed later.
E89-1006.txt,78,The concept of resolution here is broader than the usual one which comprises mainly determining the reference of anaphoric expressions like pronouns.
E89-1006.txt,79,We use the term as covering all kinds of context dependency beyond the single sentence level where something in the sentence has to be related to some entity in the preceding discourse.
E89-1006.txt,80,The term temporal resolution will be used to refer to the process of determining the temporal structure of the events the discourse is about.
E89-1006.txt,81,The Resolver is intended to implement good heuristics based on purely linguistic knowledge.
E89-1006.txt,82,The evaluation of the readings produced should be left to the inference machine which also can access non linguistic world knowledge.
E89-1006.txt,83,4.2 Temporal Features in the FStructure In the Kamp Rohrer system the tenses are analyzed by means of four features which have temporal and aspectual meaning PERFectivity_comma_ PttO Gressivity_comma_ TENSE_comma_ Temporal Perspective Tense forms can have several meanings or functions in discourse.
E89-1006.txt,84,Plusqueparfait for instance has a reading as flashback_comma_ and a perfective state reading with the temporal perspective speech time or actually reached reference time .
E89-1006.txt,85,Imparfait can have the perspective in the past at the reference time or at the speech time.
E89-1006.txt,86,Following Kamp Rohrer 1985 _comma_ the meanings of the main narrative tenses can be described in the following way Form TP passe s. imparfait imparfait plusquep. plusquep. plusquep. cond.
E89-1006.txt,88,At least doing it facilitates the job.
E89-1006.txt,89,Beyond the imparfait pass simple_comma_ pass compos distinction French does not make use of an explicit morphological aspect marking.
E89-1006.txt,90,Therefore_comma_ for instance in the case of conditionnel_comma_ treated as anticipation of an episode_comma_ we use the Aktionsart characterization of the verb stored in the temporal sort of the DI F to specify the value of the prog feature.
E89-1006.txt,91,An episode of states and dynamics then is treated similar to an imparfait pass simple story transposed by the stored past perspective time.
E89-1006.txt,92,By this means we get an interaction of Aktionsarten and tenses.
E89-1006.txt,93,Similar to the case of flashback the tense switch from conditionnel to another past tense form marks the end of the anticipation and the reactivation of the initial level.
E89-1006.txt,94,5 Conclusion and Problems The implemented system assigns DRSs to natural language texts in such a way that the partial event structure_comma_ substructure of the whole DRS_comma_ reflects the events and temporal relations of the story.
E89-1006.txt,95,The system is incomplete at present in the following respects The interaction of nominals and aspects is not accounted for.
E89-1006.txt,96,A principled treatment of tenses in embedded clauses is missing.
E89-1006.txt,97,The resolution of deictic anaphoric temporal adjuncts is rudimentary.
E89-1006.txt,98,Knowledge about event types is at present not available to the Resolver.
E89-1006.txt,99,Thus the output event structure is generally underspecified.
E89-1006.txt,100,The integration of an inference component combined with background knowledge should restrict the number of possibilities to order the events linearly.
E89-1006.txt,101,In dependance of the Aktionsart the events of the DRS can be assigned subevents marking the boundaries of the event as suggested by Moens and Steedman 1986 _comma_ cf. Eberle 1988b .
E89-1006.txt,102,These subevents can be regarded as having no temporal extension.
E89-1006.txt,103,Thus on the subevent level before and equivalent exhaust the intuitive possibilities of temporal relations.
E89-1006.txt,104,By means of this finer granulation the linear event substructure of a DB.S corresponds to a unique linear interval structure provided the event relations before and overlap are defined in terms of Allen s interval structures cf. Allen 1983 .
E89-1006.txt,105,Thus inferencing systems which deal with intervals_comma_ as the Allen system_comma_ become available but also systems which deal with point like events as the event calculus of Kowalski Sergot 1985 .
E89-1006.txt,106,In addition we get the possibility to deal with temporal relations on different levels of precision.
E89-1006.txt,107,In Eberle 1988a the possibilities of monotonic reasoning in partial event structures in the sense of the Kowalski Sergot approach were investigated.
E89-1006.txt,108,It is planned to extend the algorithm suggested there which adds deduced events to the structure_comma_ in order to deal with measure statements_comma_ knowledge about hierarchies of event types e.g. subevent 49 typologies and temporal frames for event types average duration of an event type .
E89-1006.txt,109,One aim is to rule out circular structures as mentioned in section 4.4.
E89-1006.txt,110,For simple cases we are able to do it yet.
E89-1006.txt,111,In such conflicting cases one has to backtrack to the Resolver_comma_ the Composer or the Parser to generate other readings.
E89-1006.txt,112,In this sense the suggested analysis system is non monotonic since it generates other temporal relations if necessary.
E89-1006.txt,113,When finally a consistent reading has been arrived at_comma_ the event calculus can be used for non monotonic reasoning_comma_ e.g.to deal with the problem of the validity of location times with respect to events localized before or after events for which an explicit relation of inclusion holds. .
E89-1005.txt,1,structure of problem solving discourse in the expert advising setting can be modeled by adding a layer of metaplans to a plan based model of the task domain. Classes of metaplans are introduced to model both the agent s gradual refinement and instantiation of a domain plan for a task and the space of possible queries about preconditions or fillers for open variable slots that can be motivated by the exploration of particular classes of domain plans.
E89-1005.txt,2,This metaplan structure can be used to track an agent s problem solving progress and to predict at each point likely follow on queries based on related domain plans.
E89-1005.txt,3,The model is implemented in the Pragma system where it is used to suggest corrections for ill formed input.
E89-1005.txt,5,Significant progress has been achieved recently in natural language NL understanding systems through the use of plan recognition and plan tracking schemes that maintain models of the agent s domain plans and goals.
E89-1005.txt,6,Such systems have been used for recognizing discourse structure_comma_ processing anaphora_comma_ providing cooperative responses_comma_ and interpreting intersentential ellipsis.
E89-1005.txt,7,However_comma_ a model of the discourse context must capture more than just the plan structure of the problem domain.

E89-1037.txt,1,sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation_comma_ as formalized in the LFG notion of codescriptions. The approach is illustrated with examples from English_comma_ German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis. .
E89-1037.txt,2,In this paper we sketch an approach to machine translation that offers several advantages compared to many of the other strategies currently being pursued.
E89-1037.txt,3,We define the relationship between the linguistic structures of the source and target languages in terms of a set of correspondence functions instead of providing derivational or procedural techniques for converting source into target.
E89-1037.txt,4,This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic .
E89-1002.txt,1,is a tacit assumption of much linguistic inquiry that all distinct derivations of a string should assign distinct meanings. But despite the tidiness of such derivational uniqueness_comma_ there seems to be no a priori reason to assume that a gramma r must have this property.
E89-1002.txt,2,If a grammar exhibits derivational equivalence_comma_ whereby distinct derivations of a string assign the same meanings_comma_ naive exhaustive search for all derivations will be redundant_comma_ and quite possibly intractable.
E89-1002.txt,3,In this paper we show how notions of derivation reduction and normal form can be used to avoid unnecessary work while parsing with grammars exhibiting derivational equivalence.
E89-1002.txt,4,With grammar regarded as analogous to logic_comma_ derivations are proofs what we are advocating is proof reduction_comma_ and normal form proof the invocation of these logical techniques adds a further paragraph to the story of parsing as deduction. .
E89-1002.txt,5,The phenomenon of derivational equivalence is most evident in work on generalised categorial grammars_comma_ where it has been referred to as spurious ambiguity .
E89-1002.txt,6,It has been argued that the capacity to assign left branching_comma_ and therefore incrementally interpretable_comma_ analyses makes these grammars of particular psychological interest.
E89-1002.txt,7,We will illustrate our methodology by reference to generalised categorial grammars using a combinatory logic as opposed to say_comma_ lambda calculus semantics.
E89-1002.txt,8,In particular we consider combinatory categorial grammars with rules and generalised rules We thank Mike Reape for criticism and suggestions in relation to this material_comma_ and Inge Bethke and Henk Zeevat for reading a late draft.
E89-1002.txt,9,All errors are our own.
E89-1002.txt,10,The work was carried out by the alphabetically first author under ESRC Postgraduate Award C00428722003 and by the second under ESRC Postgraduate Award C00428522008 and an SERC Postdoctoral Fellowship in IT. of the kind of Steedman 1987 _comma_ and with metarules Morri 19ss .
E89-1002.txt,11,Although the problem of derivational equivalence is most apparent in generalised categorial grammars_comma_ the problem is likely to recur in many grammars characterising a full complement of constructions.
E89-1002.txt,12,For example_comma_ suppose that a grammar is capable of characterising right extraposition of an object s adjunct to clause final position.
E89-1002.txt,13,Then sentences such as Joha met a man yesterday who swims will be generated.
E89-1002.txt,14,But it is probable that the same grammar will assign Joha met a maa who swims a right extraposition derivation in which the relative clause happens to occupy its normal position in the string the normal and right extraposition derivations generate the same strings with the same meanings_comma_ so there is derivational equivalence.
E89-1002.txt,15,Note that a single equivalence of this kind in a grammar undermines a methodological assumption of derivational uniqueness.

E89-1017.txt,1,paper presents some of the results obtained within a research project aimed at developing ET English Tutor _comma_ an intelligent tutoring system which supports Italian students in learning the English verbs. We concentrate on one of the most important modules of the system_comma_ the domain i.e. verb expert which is devoted to generate_comma_ in a cognitively transparent way_comma_ the right tense for the verb s appearing in the exercises presented to the student.
E89-1017.txt,2,An example which highlights the main capabilities of the verb expert is provided.
E89-1017.txt,3,A prototype version of ET has been fully implemented.
E89-1017.txt,5,In the course of its evolution_comma_ English has lost most of the complexities which still characterize other Indo European languages.
E89-1017.txt,6,Modern English_comma_ for example_comma_ has no declensions_comma_ it makes minimum use of the subjunctive mood and adopts natural gender instead of the grammatical one.
E89-1017.txt,7,The language_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ has become more precise in other ways cases have thus been replaced by prepositions and fixed word order while subtle meaning distinctions can be conveyed through a highly sophisticated use of tense expressions.
E89-1017.txt,8,Learning correct verb usage is however extremely difficult for non native speakers and causes troubles to people who study English as a foreign language.
E89-1017.txt,9,In order to overcome the difficulties which can be found in this and several other grammatical areas_comma_ various attempts have been made to utilize Artificial Intelligence techniques for developing very sophisticated systems_comma_ called Intelligent Tutoring Systems_comma_ in the specific domain of foreign language teaching Barchan_comma_ Woodmansee_comma_ and Yazdani_comma_ 1985 Cunningham_comma_ Iberall_comma_ and Woolf_comma_ 1986 Schuster and Finin_comma_ 1986 Weischedel_comma_ Voge_comma_ and James_comma_ 1978 Zoch_comma_ Sabah_comma_ and Alviset_comma_ 1986 .

E89-1017.txt,13,In this paper we present some of the results obtained within a research project aimed at developing ET English Tutor _comma_ an ITS which helps Italian students to learn the English verb system.
E89-1017.txt,14,An overall description of ET_comma_ of its structure and mode of operation has been given elsewhere Fum_comma_ Giangrandi_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1017.txt,15,We concentrate here on one of the most important modules of the system_comma_ the domain i.e. verb expert which is devoted to generate_comma_ in a cognitively transparent way_comma_ the right tense for the verb s appearing in the exercises presented to the student.
E89-1017.txt,16,The paper analyzes some issues that have been dealt with in developing the verb expert focusing 124 on the knowledge and processing mechanisms utilized.
E89-1017.txt,17,The paper is organized as follows.
E89-1017.txt,18,Section two introduces our approach to the problem of tense generation in the context of a tutor for second language teaching.
E89-1017.txt,19,Section three briefly illustrates the ET general architecture and mode of operation.
E89-1017.txt,20,Section four constitutes the core of the paper and presents the design requirements_comma_ knowledge bases and reasoning algorithms of the verb expert together with an example which highlights its main capabilities.
E89-1017.txt,21,The final section deals with the relevance of the present proposal both in the framework of linguistic studies on verb generation and of intelligent tutoring systems for language teaching.
E89-1017.txt,23,THE TENSE GENERATION PROBLEM An important part of the meaning of a sentence is constituted by temporal information.
E89-1017.txt,24,Every complete sentence must contain a main verb and this verb_comma_ in all IndoEuropean languages_comma_ is temporally marked.
E89-1017.txt,25,The tense of the verb indicates the relation between the interval or instant of time in which the situation i.e. state_comma_ event_comma_ activity etc. described in the sentence takes place and the moment in which the sentence is uttered_comma_ and may also indicate subtle temporal relations between the main situation and other situations described or referenced in the same sentence.
E89-1017.txt,26,Other information can be derived from the mood and aspect of the verb_comma_ from the lexical category which the verb is a member of and_comma_ more generally_comma_ from several kinds of temporal expressions that may appear in the sentence.
E89-1017.txt,27,Moreover_comma_ the choice of the tense is determined by other information_comma_ not directly related with temporal meaning_comma_ such as speaker s intention and perspective_comma_ rhetoric characteristics of discourse_comma_ etc. Very complex relations exist among all these features which native speakers take into account in understanding a sentence or in generating an appropriate tense for a given clause or sentence.
E89-1017.txt,28,The problem of choosing the right verb tense in order to convey the exact meaning a sentence is intended to express has aroused the interest of linguists_comma_ philosophers_comma_ logicians and people interested in computational accounts of language usage see_comma_ for example Ehrich_comma_ 1987 Fuenmayor_comma_ 1987 Matthiessen_comma_ 1984 .
E89-1017.txt,29,There is however no agreement on_comma_ and no complete theoretical account of_comma_ the factors which contribute to tense generation.
E89-1017.txt,30,The different proposals which exist in the literature greatly vary according to the different features that are actually identified as being critical and their level of explicitness_comma_ i.e. which features are given directly to the tense selection process and which must be inferred through some form of reasoning Our interest in this topic focuses on developing a system for tense selection capable of covering most of the cases which can be found in practice and usable for teaching English as a foreign language.
E89-1017.txt,31,A basic requirement which we have followed in designing ET is its cognitive adequacy not only the final result i.e. the tense which is generated _comma_ but also the knowledge and reasoning used in producing it should mirror those utilized by a human expert in the field i.e. by a competent native speaker .
E89-1017.txt,32,The ITS must thus be an articulated or glass box expert.
E89-1017.txt,34,THE ET SYSTEM ET is an intelligent tutoring system devoted to support Italian students in learning the usage of English verbs.
E89-1017.txt,35,The system_comma_ organized around the classical architecture of an ITS Sleeman and Brown 1982 _comma_ consists essentially of the Tutor_comma_ which is devoted to manage the teaching activity and the interaction with the student_comma_ the Student Modeler which is able to evaluate the student s competence in the specific domain_comma_ and the Domain i.e. verb Expert which is an articulated expert in the specific domain dealt with by the system.
E89-1017.txt,36,In what follows_comma_ in order to better understand the discussion of the Domain Expert_comma_ a sketchy account of the system mode of operation is given.
E89-1017.txt,37,125 At the beginning of each session_comma_ the Tutor starts the interaction with the student by presenting him an exercise on a given topic.
E89-1017.txt,38,The same exercise is given to the Domain Expert which will provide both the correct solution and a trace of the reasoning employed for producing it.
E89-1017.txt,39,At this point_comma_ the Student Modeler compares the answer of the student with that of the expert in order to identify the errors_comma_ if any_comma_ present in the former and to formulate some hypotheses about their causes.
E89-1017.txt,40,On the basis of these hypotheses_comma_ the Tutor selects the next exercise which will test the student on the critical aspects pointed out so far and will allow the Modeler to gather further information which could be useful for refining the hypotheses previously drawn.
E89-1017.txt,41,Eventually_comma_ when some misconceptions have been identified_comma_ the refined and validated hypotheses will be used in order to explain the errors to the student and to suggest possible remediations.
E89-1017.txt,42,When a topic has been thoroughly analyzed_comma_ the Tutor will possibly switch to other topics.
E89-1017.txt,44,THE DOMAIN EXPERT The Domain Expert is devoted to generate the fight answers for the exercises proposed to the student.
E89-1017.txt,45,Usually_comma_ exercises are constituted by a few English sentences in which some of the verbs open items are given in infinitive form and have to be conjugated into an appropriate tense.
E89-1017.txt,46,Sometimes_comma_ in order to avoid ambiguities_comma_ additional information describing the correct interpretation as far as the temporal point of view is concerned of the sentence is given.
E89-1017.txt,47,Consequently_comma_ the Domain Expert must be able i to select the grammatical tense to employ for each open item of the exercise in order to correctly describe the status of the world the sentence is intended to represent_comma_ and ii to appropriately conjugate the verb according to the chosen tense.
E89-1017.txt,48,Besides these basic functionalities_comma_ the tutoring environment in which the Domain Expert operates imposes a further requirement_comma_ i.e. the expert must be able iii to explain to the student how the solution has been found_comma_ which kind of knowledge has been utilized_comma_ and why.
E89-1017.txt,49,While the sentences that are presented to the student are in natural language form_comma_ the verb expert receives in input a schematic description of the sentence.
E89-1017.txt,50,Every sentence of the exercise is constituted by one or more clauses playing a particular role in it major clauses and minor clauses at various levels of subordination .
E89-1017.txt,51,Each clause is represented inside the system through a series of attribute value pairs called exercise descriptors that highlight the information relevant for the tense selection process.
E89-1017.txt,52,This information includes_comma_ for example_comma_ the kind of clause main_comma_ coordinate_comma_ subordinate _comma_ whether the clause has a verb to be solved_comma_ the voice and form of the clause_comma_ the kind of event described by the clause_comma_ the time interval associated with the event described in the clause_comma_ etc. Some of the exercise descriptors must be manually coded and inserted in the exercise data base whereas the others mainly concerning purely linguistic features can be automatically inferred by a preprocessor devoted to parsing the exercise text.
E89-1017.txt,53,For instance_comma_ the schematic description of ET EXERCISE 1 7 live in this house for ten years.
E89-1017.txt,54,Now the roof needs repairing. is the following with the items automatically inferred by the parser preceded by the symbol  EXERCISE ex 1 text I live in this house for ten years.
E89-1017.txt,56,When solving an open item_comma_ the Domain Expert must infer from the exercise descriptors all the remaining information needed to make the final choice of the appropriate tense This information is constituted by several tense features_comma_ each one describing some facet of the situation that is necessary to take into account The choice of which tense features are to be considered in the tense selection process represents a fundamental step in the design of the verb generation module.
E89-1017.txt,57,This problem has no agreed upon solution_comma_ and it constitutes one of the most critical parts of any theory of tense generation Ehrich_comma_ 1987 Fuenmayor_comma_ 1987 Matthiessen_comma_ 1984 .
E89-1017.txt,58,The main features considered by the Domain Expert are listed below Some of the features are already included in the exercise descriptors 1 to 4 _comma_ whereas the others must be inferred by the system when solving the exercise 5 to 8 1.
E89-1017.txt,59,Category_comma_ which identifies the kind of situation described by the clause e.g._comma_ event_comma_ state_comma_ action_comma_ activity_comma_ etc. .
E89-1017.txt,61,Aspect_comma_ which concerns the different viewpoints that can be utilized for describing a situation.
E89-1017.txt,63,Intentionality_comma_ which states whether the situation describes a course of action that has been premeditated or not.
E89-1017.txt,65,Context_comma_ which concerns the type of discourse in which the clause or sentence appears.
E89-1017.txt,67,Duration_comma_ which refers to the time span long_comma_ short_comma_ instantaneous_comma_ etc. occupied by a situation.
E89-1017.txt,69,Perspective_comma_ which refers to the position along the temporal axis of the situation or to its relation with the present time.
E89-1017.txt,71,Temporal Relations_comma_ which refer to the temporal relations simultaneity_comma_ contiguity_comma_ precedence_comma_ etc. that occur between the situation dealt with in the current clause and the situations described in other clauses 8.
E89-1017.txt,72,Adverbial Information_comma_ which is related to the meaning of possible temporal adverbials specified in the same clause.
E89-1017.txt,73,The Domain Expert operation is supported by a knowledge base constituted by a partitioned set of production rules which express in a transparent and cognitively consistent way what is necessary to do in order to generate a verb tense Its activity is mostly concerned with the derivation of the tense features strictly related to temporal reasoning.
E89-1017.txt,74,The exercise descriptors include for this purpose only basic information related to the specific temporal adverbials or conjunctions which appear in the exercise.
E89-1017.txt,75,This information is utilized to build a temporal model of the situation described in the exercise.
E89-1017.txt,76,Initially_comma_ the temporal model is only partially known and is then augmented through the application of a set of temporal relation rules This rules constitute a set of axioms of a temporal logic similar to that utilized by Allen 1984 which has been specifically developed for a representing the basic temporal knowledge about the situations described in the exercise b reasoning about these knowledge in order to compute some of the tense features not explicitly present in the schematic description of the exercise.
E89-1017.txt,77,The first task of the expert module is therefore that of deriving possible new relations which hold among situations described in the exercise.
E89-1017.txt,78,In the schematic description of exercise 1 we can see two time relations explicitly asserted meet d_comma_ now and equal tl_comma_ t2 .
E89-1017.txt,79,The meaning of the fast clause is that the time interval t2 corresponding to the temporal expression for ten years precedes and is contiguous to the time interval indicated by now i.e. the speaking time The meaning of the second clause is that the time interval tl representing the state or event expressed by the main verb is equal to the time interval t2.
E89-1017.txt,80,From the explick time relation it is possible to derive_comma_ by employing the following time relation rule meet tx_comma_ ty equal tx_comma_ tz  meet tz_comma_ ty . the inferred relation 127 meet t1_comma_ now .
E89-1017.txt,81,The Domain Expert tries then to infer_comma_ for every exercise clause_comma_ the so called reference time_comma_ i.e._comma_ the moment of time which the situation described in the sentence refers to Matthiessen_comma_ 1984 Fuenmayor_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1017.txt,82,In order to determine the reference time of every clause_comma_ the expert utilizes a set of reference time identification rules whose condition part takes into account the structural description of the sentence.
E89-1017.txt,83,An example of reference time identification rule is the following IF 1 clause_kind main_comma_ 2 previous_coordinate nil OR new_speaker nil OR clause_form interrogative_comma_ 3 time_expression nil I HEN set the reference_time to the most specific time expression By applying this rule to the structural description of Exercise 1 it is possible to infer that the reference time of the clause cl is the interval t2 that_comma_ being the only time expression present in the clause_comma_ is also the most specific one.
E89-1017.txt,84,When all the reference times have been determined_comma_ the Domain Expert looks only for the clauses with open items in order to compute through the temporal axioms three particular temporal relations Ehrich_comma_ 1987 deictic between reference time and speaking time RT ST _comma_ intrinsic between event time and reference time ET RT and ordering between event time and speaking time ETST .
E89-1017.txt,85,When these relations have been computed_comma_ all the needed tense features are known_comma_ and the final tense selection can be performed.
E89-1017.txt,86,Again_comma_ a set of selection rules takes care of this activity.
E89-1017.txt,87,In our example_comma_ the following selection rules can be applied IF I category state OR category iterated_action_comma_ 2 meet event_time_comma_ now _comma_ 3 meet reference_time_comma_ now _comma_ 4 equal event_time_comma_ reference_time _comma_ 5 aspect persistent THEN apply the present perfect tense.
E89-1017.txt,88,IF 1 category single_action OR category state_comma_ 2 meet evenLtime_comma_ now _comma_ 3 meet reference_time_comma_ now _comma_ 4 equal event_time_comma_ reference_time _comma_ 5 duration short_comma_ 6 aspect persistent_comma_ 7 context formal_comma_ 8 verb accepts ing_form THEN apply the present perfect continuous tense. which provide two different both correct solutions for the open item.
E89-1017.txt,89,Once the tense to be used has been identified_comma_ the verb is conjugated utilizing an appropriate set of conjugation rules.
E89-1017.txt,90,In our example the present perfect is obtained through the application_comma_ among others_comma_ of the following rules IF tense present perfect THEN the verb sequence is formed with simple present of to have past participle of the verb.
E89-1017.txt,91,IF 1 tense past participle_comma_ 2 verb is regular THEN the verb sequence is formed with ed form of the verb.
E89-1017.txt,93,CONCLUSIONS In the paper we have presented some issues involved in the design of a verb generation module within a research project aimed at developing an ITS capable of teaching the English verb system.
E89-1017.txt,94,A first prototype of ET has been fully implemented in MRS LISP augmented with logic and rule programming capabilities and with specific mechanism for representing meta knowledge on a SUN 3 workstation.
E89-1017.txt,95,128 Our primary goal in this phase of the project has been the cognitive adequacy of the verb expert.
E89-1017.txt,96,In order to develop it_comma_ we took a pragmatic approach_comma_ starting with the identification of the features traditionally considered by grammars_comma_ constructing rules of tense selection grounded on this features and_comma_ finally_comma_ refining features and rules according to the results obtained through their use.
E89-1017.txt,97,The work presented here relates both to the research carried out in the fields of linguistics and philosophy_comma_ concerning theories of verb generation and the temporal meaning of verbs_comma_ respectively_comma_ and the field of intelligent tutoring systems.
E89-1017.txt,98,As far as the first topic is concerned_comma_ we claim that teaching a foreign language can constitute a good benchmark for evaluating the soundness and completeness of such theories.
E89-1017.txt,99,In the field of foreign language teaching_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ the only way to build articulated_comma_ glass box experts is to provide them with language capabilities such as those devised and described by linguistic theories. .
E89-1032.txt,1,present an algorithm for the generation of sentences from the semantic representations of Unification Categorial Grammar. We discuss a variant of Shieber s semantic monotonicity requirement and its utility in our algorithm.
E89-1032.txt,2,We indicate how the algorithm may be extended to other grammars obeying the same requirement.
E89-1032.txt,3,Appendices contain a full listing of the program and a trace of execution of the algorithm.
E89-1032.txt,5,In this paper we present an algorithm for generating sentences using unification categorial grammars UCGs_comma_ Zeevat et al. 1987 but which extends to any categorial grammar with unification e.g._comma_ categorial unification grammars_comma_ Uszkoreit 1986_comma_ Karttunen 1987 .
E89-1032.txt,6,We relate the algorithm to proposals by Shieber 1988 .
E89-1032.txt,7,Following Shieber_comma_ we address the basic generation problem that is_comma_ given a syntactic category K and a semantic representation _comma_ generate every possible string def med by the grammar of category K with a semantic representation that is logically equivalent to .
E89-1032.txt,8,In more concrete terms_comma_ this means that we dispense with any planning component and directly address the intrinsic complexity of the basic generation problem.
E89-1032.txt,9,The development of such algorithms is as fundamentally important as the corresponding work on parsing algorithms.
E89-1032.txt,10,We also discuss the properties of a semantic representation language SRL and the manner of its construction which makes our algorithm effective.
E89-1032.txt,11,The crucial property is a stricter form of Shieber s 1988 property of semantic monotonicity.
E89-1032.txt,12,We not only require that the semantics introduced by all subconstituents of an expression appear within the semantics of the expression as a whole we also require that the semantics of any containing expression be a further instantiation of one of its subexpressions.
E89-1032.txt,13,We introduce the algorithm on a case by case basis_comma_ at each stage extending its coverage and include a listing of the program implementing this algorithm_comma_ as appendix A.
E89-1032.txt,15,Basis of the algorithm The most important feature of categorial grammars is the close correspondence of syntactic and semantic ftmctors.
E89-1032.txt,16,In generation_comma_ if the semantic functor of an expression can be identified_comma_ possible values of the syntactic functor can also be determined.
E89-1032.txt,17,Under these circumstances_comma_ a simple recursive procedure can be stated which implements a mixed top down and bottom up strategy_comma_ alternately determining the functor of an expression and generating the arguments to that functor.
E89-1032.txt,18,In the presentation of the basic algorithm below we will make the simplifying assumption that for any formula of the semantic representation language_comma_ the syntactic and semantic functors are immediately identifiable.
E89-1032.txt,19,We will have to relax this restriction in order to deal with phenomena such as type raising and identity semantics.
E89-1032.txt,20,UCG employs only two types of phrase structure rules.
E89-1032.txt,21,First_comma_ there are two binary rules of forward and backward application.
E89-1032.txt,22,Schematically_comma_ these can be represented as follows.
E89-1032.txt,24,The second is just like the first except that pre is substituted for post and the order of the daughters is reversed.
E89-1032.txt,25,Notice the use of the order feature.
E89-1032.txt,26,If a sign is an argument_comma_ then its order value is pre post if it precedes follows its functor.
E89-1032.txt,28,Second_comma_ UCG employs a small set of unary rules of the form a  where a and I are UCG signs.
E89-1032.txt,29,Unary rules have several uses.
E89-1032.txt,30,These include the treatment of unbounded dependencies_comma_ syntactic forms of type raising e.g._comma_ generic noun to np rules and subcategorization for optional modifiers.
E89-1032.txt,31,In general_comma_ unary rules relate one category to another.
E89-1032.txt,32,In particular_comma_ unary rules can change the category of a functor.
E89-1032.txt,33,This will require a modification to the basic strategy we present below.
E89-1032.txt,34,The language InL Indexed Language is a variant of Kamp s 1981 Discourse Representation Theory.
E89-1032.txt,35,Its most important properties are i every expression has a privileged variable its index and ii every variable is sorted_comma_ so indicating the ontological category of the object denoted by the variable.
E89-1032.txt,36,The only logical connectives are conjunction and implication.
E89-1032.txt,37,The semantics of an expression is constructed compositionally via unification.
E89-1032.txt,38,As discussed further below_comma_ the semantic representation of any sentence in UCG is simply a further instantiation of the semantics associated lexically with one element of the sentence.
E89-1032.txt,40,A sketch of the algorithm Below we present the basic algorithm which implements the informal description given above.
E89-1032.txt,41,We give the algorithm in Prolog for convenience because various refinements to the algorithm to be discussed below e.g._comma_ the use of a chart depend directly on the procedural aspects of Prolog s control strategy.
E89-1032.txt,42,This basic version of the algorithm requires that UCG signs be encoded as first order terms and that term unification is used.
E89-1032.txt,43,This includes both InL formulas and sorted indices.
E89-1032.txt,44,A graph encoding of signs and graph unification could be used but this would make the presentation of the basic ideas more complicated.
E89-1032.txt,45,Unary rules are not covered in this first approximation. generate Sign path__value semantics_comma_ Sign_comma_ InL _comma_ path value semant ics_comma_ SignO_comma_ InL _comma_ lexical SignO _comma_ reduce SignO_comma_ Sign . reduce Sign_comma_ Sign . reduce Sign0_comma_ Sign path value syntax active_comma_ Sign0_comma_ Active _comma_ apply Sign0_comma_ Active_comma_ Result _comma_ generate Active _comma_ reduce Result_comma_ Sign .
E89-1032.txt,46,The predicate path_value Path_comma_Sign_comma_Value succeeds if the value of the path Path through the sign Sign is Value.
E89-1032.txt,47,lexicai Sign succeeds if the sign Sign can be unified with a lexical entry.
E89-1032.txt,48,apply FunctorActive_comma_ResulO implements the rules of forward and backward functional application as discussed above. generate Sign generates a sign Sign with phonology _comma_ syntactic category K and semantics Z by creating a new sign SignO with phonology _comma_ syntactic category K and semantics Z_comma_ unifying the sign with a lexical entry and then reducing SignO to Sign in a bottom up fashion.
E89-1032.txt,49,Thus generate implements the top down half of the control strategy by predicting the syntactic category of Sign on the basis of which lexical entries unify with it.
E89-1032.txt,50,The bottom up reduction is necessary as it is not necessarily the case that  or that K K .
E89-1032.txt,51,In particular_comma_ unless . corresponds to a nonfunctor lexical entry_comma_ SignO will be of the schematic form X Y i.e._comma_ a lexical functor . reduce has two clauses.
E89-1032.txt,52,The first reduces a sign Sign to itself.
E89-1032.txt,53,The second reduces a sign SignO to a sign Sign if Sign0 is a functor Functor Active which when applied to Active by one of the rules of functional application gives the result sign Result_comma_ the sign Active can be generated and Result can be reduced to Sign.
E89-1032.txt,54,A sample execution of the algorithm_comma_ using only the above clauses for the two predicates_comma_ is given in Appendix B.
E89-1032.txt,55,There is a major deficiency in this algorithm.
E89-1032.txt,56,Unification is the only method used to test the logical equivalence of two semantic representations.
E89-1032.txt,57,This means that not even the axioms of commutativity or associativity are available for testing logical equivalence 1.
E89-1032.txt,58,One of the 1Strictly speaking_comma_ we test for a very strict form of consistency.
E89-1032.txt,59,Two LFs are considered logically 234consequences of this is that_comma_ given a semantic representation b_comma_ it may not be possible to generate a sentence with semantic representation 0 _comma_ where and 0 are logically equivalent.
E89-1032.txt,60,In fact_comma_ it may not be possible to generate any sentence even though there are sentences defined by the grammar which have semantic representations which are equivalent to b.
E89-1032.txt,61,So_comma_ for example_comma_ an semantic representation which is produced by parsing a nontopicalised sentence cannot be used to generate a topicalised sentence.
E89-1032.txt,62,Shieber 1988 claims that the problem of logical equivalence reduces to the knowledge representation problem.
E89-1032.txt,63,The claim is that there will be no full solution to this problem in the near future.
E89-1032.txt,64,To satisfy our definition of generation however_comma_ we must generate all sentences whose semantic representations are logically equivalent to the semantic representation being generated under the rules of inference and axioms of the semantic representation language.
E89-1032.txt,65,In the case of InL_comma_ the primary axioms are simply associativity and commutativity.
E89-1032.txt,66,However_comma_ these two axioms alone give the equivalence problem factorial complexity.
E89-1032.txt,67,We will discuss these issues below after we have introduced some refinements to the algorithm.
E89-1032.txt,69,Refinements to the basic algorithm The algorithm presented above is deficient in other respects.
E89-1032.txt,70,There are three other aspects of UCG analyses that are not covered.
E89-1032.txt,71,First_comma_ all Nl s are typeraised.
E89-1032.txt,72,The standard UCG analysis of non lexieal NPs is adequately handled using the above definitions_comma_ as the resulting semantic structure contains information introduced by the determiner.
E89-1032.txt,73,On the other hand_comma_ a lexical NP such as Harry will bind a variable in the semantics of an expression indicating that the translation of Harry is a constant.
E89-1032.txt,74,However_comma_ no other semantic material will be introduced from which the need to generate a lexical NP could be inferred.
E89-1032.txt,75,This is remedied quite easily by adding the condition_comma_ to the second clause of reduce above_comma_ that the category of SignO is not np_comma_ and by adding the following clause to reduce reduce Sign0_comma_ Sign path_value category active_comma_ Sign0_comma_ Active _comma_ path_value category_comma_ Active_comma_ np _comma_ path_value semantics_comma_ Active_comma_ Index _comma_ proper name Index _comma_ equivalent if their sorted indices are consistent but the rest of the formula is logically equivalent.
E89-1032.txt,76,We return to this point briefly below. typeraise_np Active_comma_ TypeRaisedNP _comma_ apply TypeRaisedNP_comma_ Sign0_comma_ Mother _comma_ generate TypeRaisedNP _comma_ reduce Mother_comma_ Sign .
E89-1032.txt,77,The most important part of the above def mition is the restriction of the clause to the generation of elements which satisfy the predicate proper name we assume this test to be appropriately defined according to the semantic representation language used.
E89-1032.txt,78,In our case_comma_ it is a simple test for instantiation.
E89-1032.txt,79,The predicate typeraise_np Active_comma_ TypeRaisedNP relates a non type raised to a type raised NP.
E89-1032.txt,80,Note that in the call to generate_comma_ we attempt to generate from the constructed type raised NP.
E89-1032.txt,81,The reasons for this are that lexical NPs have to be type raised prior to the lexical lookup in generate and that the argument to the type raised NP is generated in exactly the same manner as other arguments.
E89-1032.txt,82,Two further problems are the treatment of unary rules and functors with what Shieber 1988 calls vestigial semantics_comma_ which we prefer to call identity semantics.
E89-1032.txt,83,The latter identify the semantics of their argument with their own semantics.
E89-1032.txt,84,That is_comma_ they are semantically vacuous.
E89-1032.txt,85,Examples from English are complementisers and case marking prepositions.
E89-1032.txt,86,Again_comma_ we add an additional clause to reduce which enumerates the set of relations that may hold between signs under unary rules and under functors with identity semantics_comma_ using the auxiliary predicate transform.
E89-1032.txt,87,The clause re.cursively invokes reduce as it may be the case that a unary rule or functor with identity semantics introduces further syntactic arguments. reduce Sign0_comma_ Sign transform Sign0_comma_ Sign1 _comma_ reduce Sign1_comma_ Sign .
E89-1032.txt,88,transform Daughter_comma_ Mother unary_rule Mother_comma_ Daughter .
E89-1032.txt,89,transform Sign0_comma_ Sign path_value category active_comma_ Sign1_comma_ Sign0 _comma_ identity Sign1 _comma_ apply Sign1_comma_ Sign0_comma_ Sign . identity enumerates those lexical entries whose semantics is the same as that of one of its arguments.
E89-1032.txt,90,Note that both of these clauses continue the basic bottom up reduction strategy.
E89-1032.txt,91,Essentially_comma_ we must freely apply both identity semantics functors and unary rules to guarantee completeness of the algorithm.
E89-1032.txt,92,Given that we apply unary rules and identity functors freely_comma_ our algorithm will only terminate if the bottom up closure of such elements 235 with respect to elements of the lexicon is finite.
E89-1032.txt,93,In other words_comma_ we require that the grammar adhere to the offline parsability constraint Kapland and Bresnan 1982 .
E89-1032.txt,94,If this condition does not hold_comma_ the algorithm will not terminate.
E89-1032.txt,96,Optimizations of the algorithm Given the fairly high degree of top down control_comma_ it should be obvious that the generator will generate some subformulas of its input repeatedly as it explores the search space.
E89-1032.txt,97,The obvious solution is to use a lemma table or chart as discussed by Pereira and Warren 1984 and Shieber 1988 .
E89-1032.txt,98,Shieber 1988 states that to guarantee completeness in using a precomputed entry in the chart_comma_ the entry must subsume the formula being generated top down.
E89-1032.txt,99,However_comma_ empirical tests have shown that a naive chart strategy results in the chart never being used at all.
E89-1032.txt,100,This is to be expected given the nature of generation since most of the signs being generated top down are very partial often they will have only the semantics instantiated and chart entries will be very complete since most information is projected from the lexicon it will almost never be the case that a top down sign is subsumed by the chart.
E89-1032.txt,101,The result is that we must either abandon the idea of using a chart I or else devise a strategy for its use which is complete_comma_ does not rely on the subsumption test and does not put too many entries in the chart We have followed the latter strategy.
E89-1032.txt,102,This technique depends crucially on avoiding any topdown instantiation of candidate chart entries and by guaranteeing bottom up completeness of chart entries consistent with a restriction of the top down sign.
E89-1032.txt,103,The nature of the restriction that we use depends on properties of the semantic representation language itself.
E89-1032.txt,104,In particular_comma_ the only use of variables in the language is in representing existentially quantified variables over individuals.
E89-1032.txt,105,Thus every appearance of a variable can only be further instanfiated by a semantic individual constant and so the semantic representation after generation cannot be further instantiated in such a way that the denotation of that expression differs from that of the input semantic representation.
E89-1032.txt,106,1A recent implementation of a similar algorithm by Thierry Guillotin and Agnes Plainfoss6 Personal communication suggests that the top down application of unary rules_comma_ while making it impossible to guarantee completeness if making use of a chart_comma_ nevertheless leads to an overall improvement in efficiency by limiting the search space engendered by unary rules.
E89-1032.txt,107,This supports the contention that unary rule application is the dominant cost in generation with UCG.
E89-1032.txt,108,The program presented in Appendix A illustrates the use of the chart.
E89-1032.txt,109,The reader will notice that the instruction to add information to the chart follows calls to generate but precedes calls to reduce.
E89-1032.txt,110,This strategy means that we keep the chart free of the top down instantiations caused by equating a bottom up solution the first argument of reduce to a top down goal the second argument of reduce .
E89-1032.txt,111,Another method for reducing the search space is to use the technique of freezing in cases where the premature instantiation of variables will lead to avoidable backtracking.
E89-1032.txt,112,In the case of our current UCG grammar_comma_ it is often the case that the order feature is not instantiated when apply is called.
E89-1032.txt,113,If the argument is generated before the phonology is instantiated_comma_ then unnecessary generations with the wrong word order can be prevented.
E89-1032.txt,114,Therefore_comma_ we freeze the value of the phonology and order attributes until after an argument is generated.
E89-1032.txt,115,This requires some care to ensure that the freezing interacts with the chart strategy correctly.
E89-1032.txt,116,This is illustrated in the full program listing below.
E89-1032.txt,117,It is to be expected that more complex grammars would benefit from an extension of this technique to other attributes with mut j lly dependent values.
E89-1032.txt,119,Extension to other grammatical formalisms We alluded above to our assumption about the relationship between the semantics of lexical and non lexical expressions.
E89-1032.txt,120,To recap_comma_ any semantic representation is a further instantiation of the semantic representation of some lexical item.
E89-1032.txt,121,This assumption will not hold for any grammar in which semantic material is introduced by rule i.e. syncategorematically .
E89-1032.txt,122,The reason for this should be obvious given the definition of generate above.
E89-1032.txt,123,If a particular semantic representation possibly contains semantic structure not present in the lexicon_comma_ then any attempt to find an appropriate lexical functor on the basis of the semantics of an expression is not guaranteed to succeed.
E89-1032.txt,124,Relaxing this assumption would effectively remove all top down predictive capacity for generation.
E89-1032.txt,125,The only solution in the context of this algorithm would then be to allow topdown application of all rules and to delay calls to lexical lookup until after rule application.
E89-1032.txt,126,This generate and test strategy is not only likely to be inefficient_comma_ it will also result in non termination for many grammars.
E89-1032.txt,127,In contrast_comma_ for grammars which do adhere to our assumption_comma_ our algorithm is effective_comma_ even if rules other than simple binary and unary rules are used.
E89-1032.txt,128,To see this_comma_ consider the following extension to reduce 236 reduce SignO_comma_ Sign rule Morn_comma_ SignO_comma_ Kids _comma_ generate_sisters Kids _comma_ reduce Morn_comma_ Sign .
E89-1032.txt,129,Note that this clause is very similar in structure to the second clause for reduce_comma_ the main difference being that the new clause makes fewer assumptions about the feature structures being manipulated_comma_ rule enumerates rules of the grammar_comma_ its first argument representing the mother constituent_comma_ its second the head daughter and its third a list of non head daughters which are to be recursively generated by the predicate generate_sisters.
E89-1032.txt,130,We assume_comma_ as with UCG_comma_ that information indicating the resulting phonology and order of constituents is contained within the feature structures of the rule .
E89-1032.txt,131,The behaviour of this clause is just like that of the clause for reduce which implements the UCG rules of function application.
E89-1032.txt,132,On the basis of the generated lexical sign SignO an application of the rule is hypothesised and we then attempt to prove that that rule application will lead to a new sign Morn which reduces to the original goal Sign.
E89-1032.txt,133,The same conditions apply to the generalized form of the predicate as to the clause for unary rules_comma_ namely the algorithm will terminate if the bottom up closure of the rules of the grammar is finite.
E89-1032.txt,134,We conjecture that this algorithm extends naturally to the rules of composition_comma_ division and permutation of Combinatory Categorial Grammar Steedman 1987 and the Lambek calculus 1958 .
E89-1032.txt,136,Implementation The algorithm discussed in this paper has been implemented in C Prolog.
E89-1032.txt,137,Recent work has looked at generation from semantic representations which are not in canonical format but which are equivalent_comma_ under the axioms of associativity and commutativity to the canonical semantics of sentences recognised by the grammar.
E89-1032.txt,138,Our effort is directed at formulating appropriate notions of semicanonicality _comma_ which lessen the strict and in many cases unobtainable requirement that the representation to be generated from is identical to that obtained as the result of parsing.
E89-1032.txt,139,Such notions would increase the utility of generators such as we have presented while avoiding the dangers of factorial complexity.
E89-1032.txt,140,A further source of inefficiency is the naive lexical indexing strategy used by the predicate lexical.
E89-1032.txt,141,We have presented the algorithm as if iexical simply enumerates the lexicon.
E89-1032.txt,142,This is clearly inefficient and some form of indexing strategy seems essential.
E89-1032.txt,143,The simplest is to choose the principal functor of the semantic representation to use as the index for lexical entries which have the same principal functor in their semantics.
E89-1032.txt,144,Much of the time however_comma_ the principal functor is simply the conjunction operator.
E89-1032.txt,145,A more sophisticated indexing strategy involves calculating the best set of key s to identify candidate lexical entries.
E89-1032.txt,146,This necessarily involves considerable complexity itself.
E89-1032.txt,147,Furthermore_comma_ if such indexing is to be automatic_comma_ very sophisticated compilation techniques and metaknowledge about the possible structure of semantic representations are required.
E89-1032.txt,148,We are also investigating these possibilities.

E89-1001.txt,1,show how idioms can be parsed in lexiealized TAGs. We rely on extensive studies of frozen phrases pursued at L.A.D.L that show that idioms are pervasive in natural language and obey_comma_ generally speaking_comma_ the same morphological and syntactical patterns as free structures.
E89-1001.txt,2,By idiom we mean a structure in which some items are lexically frozen and have a semantics that is not compositional.
E89-1001.txt,3,We thus consider idioms of different syntactic categories NP_comma_ S_comma_ adverbials_comma_ compound prepositions.._comma_ in both English and French.
E89-1001.txt,4,In lexicalized TAGs_comma_ the same grammar is used for idioms as for free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,5,We assign them regular syntactic structures while representing them semantically as one non compositional entry.
E89-1001.txt,6,Syntactic transformations and insertion of modifiers may thus apply to them as to any free structures.
E89-1001.txt,7,Unlike previous approaches_comma_ their variability becomes the general case and their being totally frozen the exception.
E89-1001.txt,8,Idioms are generally represented by extended elementary trees with heads made out of several items that need not be contiguous with one of the items serving as an index.
E89-1001.txt,9,When an idiomatic tree is selected by this index_comma_ lexical items are attached to some nodes in the tree.
E89-1001.txt,10,Idiomatic trees are selected by a single head node however the head value imposes lexical values on other nodes in the tree.
E89-1001.txt,11,This operation of attaching the head item of an idiom and its lexical parts is called lexical attachment.
E89-1001.txt,12,The resulting tree has the lexical items corresponding to the pieces of the idiom already attached to it.

E89-1001.txt,17,We generalize the parsing strategy defined for lexicalized TAG to the case of heads made out of several items.
E89-1001.txt,18,We propose to parse idioms in two steps which are merged in the two steps parsing strategy that is defined for free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,19,The first step performed during the lexical pass selects trees corresponding to the literal and idiomatic interpretation.
E89-1001.txt,20,However it is not always the case that the idiomatic trees are selected as possible candidates.
E89-1001.txt,21,We require that all basic pieces building the minimal idiomatic expression must be present in the input string with possibly some order constraints .
E89-1001.txt,22,This condition is a necessary condition for the idiomatic reading but of course it is not sufficient.
E89-1001.txt,23,The second step performs the syntax analysis as in the usual case.
E89-1001.txt,24,During the second step_comma_ idiomatic reading might be rejected.
E89-1001.txt,25,Idioms are thus parsed as any free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,26,Except during the selection process_comma_ idioms do not require any special parsing mechanism.
E89-1001.txt,27,We are also able to account for cases of ambiguity between idiomatic and literal interpretations.
E89-1001.txt,28,Factoring recursion from dependencies in TAGs allows discontinuous constituents to be parsed in an elegant way.
E89-1001.txt,29,We also show how regular transformations are taken into account by the parser.
E89-1001.txt,30,Topics Parsing_comma_ Idioms.
E89-1001.txt,31,1 . to Tree Adjoining Grammars Tree Adjoining Grammars TAGs were introduced by Joshi et al. 1975 and Joshi 1985 as a formalism for linguistic description.
E89-1001.txt,32,Their linguistic relevance was shown by Kroch and Joshi 1985 and Abeill 1988.
E89-1001.txt,33,A lexicalized version of the formalism was presented in Schabes_comma_ Abeill and Joshi 1988 that makes them attractive for writing computational grammars.
E89-1001.txt,34,They were proved to be1parsable in polynomial time worst case by Vijay Shanker and Joshi 1985 and an Earley type parser was presented by Schabes and Joshi 1988.
E89-1001.txt,35,The basic component of a TAG is a finite set of elementary trees that have two types initial trees or auxiliary trees See Figure 1 .
E89-1001.txt,36,Both are minimal but complete linguistic structures and have at least one terminal at their frontier that is their head .
E89-1001.txt,38,Substitution inserts an initial tree or a tree derived from an initial tree at a leaf node bearing the same label in an elementary tree See Figure 2 .
E89-1001.txt,40,Most of the linguistic advantages of the formalism come from the fact that it factors recursion from dependencies.
E89-1001.txt,41,Kroch and Joshi 1985 show how unbounded dependencies can be localized by having filler and gap as part of 21 is the mark for substitution.
E89-1001.txt,42,SAt each node of an elementary tree_comma_ there is a feature structure associated with it Vijayshanker and Joshi_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1001.txt,43,Adjunction constraints can be defined in terms of feature structures and the success or failure of unification.  8 Figure 3 Adjoining the same elementary tree and having insertion of matrix clauses provided by recursive adjunctions.
E89-1001.txt,44,Another interesting property of the formalism is its extended domain of locality_comma_ as compared to that of usual phrase structure rules in CFG.
E89-1001.txt,45,This was used by Abeill 1988 to account for the properties of light verb often called support verb for Romance languages constructions with only one basic structure instead of the double analysis or reanalysis usually proposed .
E89-1001.txt,46,We now define by an example the notion of derivation in a TAG.
E89-1001.txt,47,Take for example the derived tree in Figure 4.
E89-1001.txt,49,The derivation tree is an object that specifies uniquely how a derived tree was constructed.
E89-1001.txt,50,The root of the derivation tree is labeled by an S type initial tree.
E89-1001.txt,51,All other nodes in the derivation tree are labeled by auxiliary trees in the case of adjunction or initial trees in the case of substitution.
E89-1001.txt,52,A tree address is associated with each node except the root node in the derivation tree.
E89-1001.txt,53,This tree address is the address of the node in the parent tree to which the adjunction or substitution has been performed.
E89-1001.txt,54,We use the following convention trees that are adjoined to their parent tree are linked by an unbroken line to their parent_comma_ and trees that are substituted are linked by dashed lines.
E89-1001.txt,57,4 Elementary trees that can be linked by a syntactic or a lexical rule are gathered in a Tree Family_comma_ that is selected as a whole by the head of the structure.
E89-1001.txt,58,A novel parsing strategy follows Schabes_comma_ Abeill _comma_ loshi 1988 .
E89-1001.txt,59,In a first step_comma_ the parser scans the input string and selects the different tree structures associated with the lexical items of the string by looking up the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,60,In a second step_comma_ these structures are combined together to produce a sentence.
E89-1001.txt,61,Thus the parser uses only a subset of the entire lexicalized grammar.
E89-1001.txt,62,4The nodes of the tree structures have feature structures associated with them_comma_ see footnote 3.
E89-1001.txt,63,2 Linguistic Properties of Idioms Idioms have been at stake in many linguistic discussions since the early transformational grammars_comma_ but no exhaustive work based on extensive listings of idioms have been pursued before Gross 1982.
E89-1001.txt,64,We rely on L.A.D.L. s work for French that studied 8000 frozen sentences_comma_ 20_comma_ 000 frozen nouns and 6000 frozen adverbs.
E89-1001.txt,65,For English_comma_ we made use of Freckelton s thesis 1984 that listed more than 3000 sentential idioms.
E89-1001.txt,66,They show that_comma_ for a given structure_comma_ idiomatic phrases are usually more numerous in the language than free ones.
E89-1001.txt,67,As is well known_comma_ idioms are made of the same lexicon and consist of the same sequences of categories as free structures.
E89-1001.txt,68,An interesting exception is the case of words existing only as part of an idiomatic phrase_comma_ such as escampette in prendre la poudre d escampette to leave furtively or umbrage in to take umbrage at NP.
E89-1001.txt,69,The specificity of idioms is their semantic noncompositionality.
E89-1001.txt,70,The meaning of casser sa pipe to die _comma_ cannot be derived from that of casser to break and that of pipe pipe .
E89-1001.txt,71,They behave semantically as one predicate_comma_ and for example the whole VP casser sa pipe selects the subject of the sentence and all possible modifiers.
E89-1001.txt,72,We therefore consider an idiom as one entity in the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,73,It would not make sense to have its parts listed in the lexicon as regular categories and to have special rules to limit their distribution to this unique context.
E89-1001.txt,74,If they are already listed in the lexicon_comma_ these existing entries are considered as mere homonyms.
E89-1001.txt,75,Furthermore_comma_ usually idioms are ambiguous between literal and idiomatic readings.
E89-1001.txt,76,Idioms do not appear necessarily as contlnuous strings in texts.
E89-1001.txt,77,As shown by M.
E89-1001.txt,78,Gross for French and P.
E89-1001.txt,79,Freckelton for English_comma_ more than 15 of sentential idioms are made up of unbounded arguments_comma_ e.g. NPo prendre NP1 en compte_comma_ NPo take NP1 into account_comma_ Butter would not melt in NP s mouth .
E89-1001.txt,80,Discontinuities can also come from the regular application of syntactic rules.
E89-1001.txt,81,For example_comma_ interposition of adverbs between verb and object in compound V NP phrases_comma_ and interposition of modals or auxiliaries between subject and verb in compound NP V phrases are very general Laporte 1988 .
E89-1001.txt,82,As shown by Gazdar et al. 1985 for English_comma_ and Gross 1982 for French_comma_ most sentential idioms are not completely frozen and transformations apply to them much more regularly3than is usually thought.
E89-1001.txt,83,Freckelton 1984 s listings of idiomatic sentences exhibit passivization for about 50 of the idioms comprised of a verb different from be and have and a frozen direct argument.
E89-1001.txt,84,Looking at a representative sample of 2000 idiomatic sentences with frozen objects from Gross s listings at LADL yields similar results for passivization and relativization of the frozen argument for French.
E89-1001.txt,85,This is usually considered a problem for parsing_comma_ since the order in which the frozen elements of an idiom appear might thus vary.
E89-1001.txt,86,Recognizing idioms is thus dependent on the whole syntactic analysis and it is not realistic to reanalyze them as simple categories in a preprocessing step.
E89-1001.txt,87,3 Representing Idioms in Lexicalized TAGs We represent idioms with the same elementary trees as free structures.
E89-1001.txt,88,The values of the arguments of trees that correspond to a literal expression are introduced via syntactic categories and semantic features.
E89-1001.txt,89,However_comma_ the values of arguments of trees that correspond to an idiomatic expression are not only introduced via syntactic categories and semantic features but also directly specified.
E89-1001.txt,90,3.1 Extended Elementary Trees Some idioms select the same elementary tree structures as free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,91,For example_comma_ a sentential idiom with a frozen subject il aut S1 selects the same tree family as any verb taking a sentential complement ex NP0 dit 1 _comma_ except that ii is directly attached in subject position_comma_ whereas a free NP is inserted in NPo in the case of dit See Figure 7 .
E89-1001.txt,92,S S NP0 VP NP0 VP IA A il V Sl V 1 I I faut dit Figure 7 trees for il faut and dit Usually idioms require elementary trees that are more expanded.
E89-1001.txt,93,Take now as another example the sentential idiom N Po kicked the bucket.
E89-1001.txt,94,The corresponding tree must be expanded up to the D1 and N1 level_comma_ the resp. bucket is directly attached to the D1 resp. N1 node See Figure 8 .
E89-1001.txt,95,S N NPo VP v Nil kicked D1 NI I I the bucket Figure 8 Tree for N Po kicked the bucket 3.2 Multicomponent Heads In the lexicon_comma_ idiomatic trees are represented by specifying the elements of the idiom.
E89-1001.txt,96,An idiom as NPo kicked the bucket is indexed by a head kicked which specifies the other pieces of the idiom.
E89-1001.txt,101,In the first pass_comma_ the trees in Figure 9 are be selected among others .
E89-1001.txt,102,Some idioms allow some lexical variation_comma_ usually between a more familiar and a regular use of the same idiom_comma_ for example in French NPo per. dre la t te and NPo perdre ia boule to get mad .
E89-1001.txt,103,This is represented by allowing disjunction on the string that gets directly attached at a certain position in the idiomatic tree.
E89-1001.txt,104,NPo perdre ia t te boule will thus be one entry in the lexicon_comma_ and we do not have to specify that t te and boule are synonymous and restrict this synonymy to hold only for this context .
E89-1001.txt,105,3.3 Selection of Idiomatic Trees We now explain how the first pass of the parser is modified to select the appropriate possible candidates for idiomatic readings.
E89-1001.txt,106,Take the previous example_comma_ John kicked the bucket.
E89-1001.txt,108,However_comma_ the values of the determiner and the noun of the object noun phrase are imposed to be respectively the and bucket.
E89-1001.txt,110,Therefore they must respectively appear in the input string at some position i_comma_ j and k such that i j k.
E89-1001.txt,112,This process is called lexical attachment.
E89-1001.txt,115,sT This test cuts down the number of idiomatic trees that are given to the parser as possible candidates.
E89-1001.txt,116,Thus a lot of idioms are ruled out before starting the syntactic analysis because we know all the lexical items at the end of the first pass.
E89-1001.txt,117,This is important because a given item e.g. a verb can be the head of a large number of idioms Gross 82 has listed more than 50 of them for the verb manger_comma_ and prendre or avoir yield thousands of them .
E89-1001.txt,118,However_comma_ as sentence s3 illustrates_comma_ the test is not sufficient.
E89-1001.txt,119,What TAGs allow us to do is to define multicomponent heads for idiomatic structures without requiring their being contiguous in the input string.
E89-1001.txt,120,The formalism also allows us to access directly the different elements of the compound without flattening the structure.
E89-1001.txt,121,As opposed to CFGs_comma_ for example_comma_ direct dependencies can be expressed between arguments that are at different levels of depth in the tree without having to pass features across local domains.
E89-1001.txt,122,For example_comma_ in NPo rider DET sac to express all of one s se 5_comma_ 2 cret thoughts _comma_ the determiner of the object sac has to be a possessive and agree in person with the subject je vide mon sac_comma_ tu rides ton sac... In NPo dire DET quatre veritds a NP2 to tell someone what he really is _comma_ the determiner of the object veritds has to be a possessive and agree in person with the second object NP2 je te dis tes quatre veritds_comma_ je lui dis ses quatre verit s.
E89-1001.txt,123,4 Literal and Idiomatic Readings Our representation expresses correctly that idioms are semantically non compositional.
E89-1001.txt,124,Trees obtained by lexical attachment of several lexical items act as one syntactic unit and also one semantic unit.
E89-1001.txt,125,For example_comma_ the sentence John kicked the bucket can be parsed in two different ways.
E89-1001.txt,132,This fact is reflected in the two derivation trees of John kicked the bucket.
E89-1001.txt,133,However_comma_ the sentential idiom il fant 1 _comma_ is not parsed as ambiguous_comma_ since faut has only one entry that is idiomatic in the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,134,When a certain item does not exist except in a specific idiom_comma_ for example umbrage in English_comma_ the corresponding idiom to take umbrage of NP will not be parsed as ambiguous.
E89-1001.txt,135,The same holds when a item selects a construction only in an idiomatic expression.
E89-1001.txt,136,Aller_comma_ for example_comma_ takes an obligatory PP or adverbial argument in its non idiomatic sense.
E89-1001.txt,137,Thus the idiom aller son train to follow one s way is not parsed as ambiguous since there is no free NPo aller NP1 structure in the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,138,We also have ambiguities for compound nominals such as carte bleue_comma_ meaning either credit card idiomatic or blue card literal _comma_ and for compound adverbials like on a dime John stopped on a dime will mean either that he stopped in a controlled way or on a 10 cent coin.
E89-1001.txt,139,Structures for literal and idiomatic readings are both selected by the parser in the first step.
E89-1001.txt,140,Since syntax and semantics are processed at the same time_comma_ the sentence is analyzed as ambiguous between literal and idiomatic interpretations.
E89-1001.txt,141,The derived trees are the same but the derivation trees are different.
E89-1001.txt,142,For example_comma_ the adjective bleue selects an auxiliary tree that is adjoined to carte in the literal derivation tree_comma_ whereas it is directly attached in a complex initial tree in the case of idiomatic interpretation.
E89-1001.txt,143,All frozen elements of the idiom are directly attached in the corresponding elementary trees_comma_ and do not have to exist in the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,144,They are thus distinguished from free arguments that select their own trees and their own semantics to be substituted in a standard sentential tree.
E89-1001.txt,145,Therefore we distinguish two kinds of semantic operations substitution or adjunction corresponds to a compositional semantics direct attachment_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ makes different items behave as one semantic unit.
E89-1001.txt,146,One should notice that non idiomatic readings are not necessarily literal readings.
E89-1001.txt,147,Since feature structures are used for selectional restrictions of arguments_comma_ metaphoric readings can be taken into account Bishop_comma_ Cote and Abeill 1989 .
E89-1001.txt,148,We are able to handle different kinds of semantic non compositionality_comma_ and we do not treat as idiomatic all cases of non literal readings.6s A NP0 VP V NPI _comma_ PP2 VA I A takes P2 NP2NA I I into N2 VA I account Figure 10 Tree for NPo takes NP1 into account NPo VP No V NPI I A A Jean Aux V Dt N1 I I I I a casse sa pipe literal S NP o VP No V NPINA I A A Jean Aux V D t NINA I I I 1 a casse sa pipe idiom Figure 11 Jean a cassg sa pipe 5 Recognizing Discontinuous Idioms Parsing flexible idioms has received only partial solutions so far Stock 1987_comma_ Laporte 1988 .
E89-1001.txt,149,Since TAGs factor recursion from dependencies_comma_ discontinuities are captured straightforwardly without special devices as opposed to Johnson 1985 or Bunt et al. 1987 .
E89-1001.txt,150,We distinguish two kinds of discontinuities discontinuities that come from internal structures and discontinuities that come from the insertion of modifiers.
E89-1001.txt,151,5.1 Internal Discontinuities Some idioms are internally discontinuous.
E89-1001.txt,152,Take for example the idioms NPo prendre NP1 en compte and NPo takes NP1 into account see Figure 10 . s The discontinuity is handled simply by arguments here NPo and NP1 to be substituted or adjoined in some cases as any free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,153,The internal structures of arguments can be unbounded.
E89-1001.txt,154,5.2 Recursive Insertions of Modifiers Some adjunctions of modifiers may be ruled out in idioms or some new ones may be valid only in idioms.
E89-1001.txt,155,If the sentence is possibly ambiguous between idiomatic and literal reading_comma_ the adjunction of such modifiers force the literal interpretation.
E89-1001.txt,156,For example_comma_ in NPo casser sa pipe to die _comma_ the NP1 node in the idiomatic tree bears a null adjunction constraint NA .
E89-1001.txt,157,The sentence H a cassd sa pipe en bois he broke his wooden pipe is SNA expresses the fact that the node has null adjunction constraint then parsed as non idiomatic.
E89-1001.txt,158,This NA constraint will be the only difference between the two derived trees See Figure 11 Jean a cass sa pipe literal and Jean a cassg sa pipe idiomatic .
E89-1001.txt,159,But most idioms allow modifiers to be inserted in them.
E89-1001.txt,160,Each modifier can be unbounded e.g. with embedded adjunct clauses and their insertion is recursive.
E89-1001.txt,161,We treat these insertion by adjunction of modifiers in the idiomatic tree.
E89-1001.txt,162,However constraint of adjunction and feature structure constraints filter out partially or totally the insertion of modifiers at each node of an idiomatic tree.
E89-1001.txt,163,In a TAG_comma_ the internal structure of idioms is specified in terms of a tree_comma_ and we can get a unified representation for such compound adverbials as la limite and l extreme limite if there is no other way or such complex determiners as a bunch of or ia majoritd de NP and a whole bunch of NP resp. la grande majoritd de NP that will not have to be listed as separate entries in the lexicon.
E89-1001.txt,164,The adjective whole resp. grande adjoins to the noun bunch resp. majoritd _comma_ as to any noun.
E89-1001.txt,165,Take a bunch of NP.
E89-1001.txt,166,The adjective whole adjoins to the noun bunch as to any noun See Figure 12 and builds a whole bunch of.
E89-1001.txt,167,In order to have a modifier with the right features adjoining at a certain node in the idiom_comma_ we associate some features with the head of the idiom as for heads of free structures but also with elements of the idiom that are directly attached.
E89-1001.txt,168,Unification equations_comma_ such as those constraining agreement_comma_ are the same for trees selected by idioms and trees selected by free structures.
E89-1001.txt,169,Thus only grande that is feminine singular_comma_ and not grand for example_comma_ can adjoin to majorit that is feminine singular.
E89-1001.txt,171,As another example_comma_ an idiom such as la moutarde monte au nez de NP NP looses his temper can be represented as contiguous in the elementary tree.
E89-1001.txt,172,Adjunction takes place at any internal node without breaking the semantic unity of the idiom.
E89-1001.txt,173,For example_comma_ an adjunct clause headed by anssit6t can adjoin between the frozen subject and the rest of the the idiom in la moutarde monter au nez de NP2 la montarde_comma_ aussitSt que Marie enlra_comma_ monta an nez de Max Max_comma_ as soon as Marie got in_comma_ lost his temper .
E89-1001.txt,174,Similarly_comma_ auxiliaries adjoin between frozen subjects and verbs as they do to free VPs There might have been a boz on the table is parsed as being derived from the idiom there be NP1 P NP2.
E89-1001.txt,175,It should be noted that when a modifier adjoins to an interior node of an idiom_comma_ there is a semantic composition between the semantics of the modifier and that of the idiom as a whole_comma_ no matter at which interior node the adjunction takes place.
E89-1001.txt,176,For example_comma_ in John kicked the proverbial bucket semantic composition happens between the 3 units John_comma_ kick the bucket_comma_ and proverbial.
E89-1001.txt,177,9 Semantic composition will be done the same way if an adjunct clause were adjoined into the VP.
E89-1001.txt,178,In John kicked the bucket_comma_ as the proverb says_comma_ composition will happen between John_comma_ kick the.bucket_comma_ and the adjunct clause considered as one predicate as proverb say 9This is the case of a modifier where adjoining is valid only for the idiom.
E89-1001.txt,179,Therefore parsing flexible idioms is reduced to the general parsing of TAGs Schabes and Joshi 1988 .
E89-1001.txt,180,6 Tree Families and Application of Transformations to Idioms As in the case of predicates in lexicalized TAGs_comma_ sentential idioms are represented as selecting a set of elementary trees and not only one tree.
E89-1001.txt,181,These tree families gather all elementary trees that are possible syntactic realizations of a given argument structure.
E89-1001.txt,182,The family for transitive verbs_comma_ for example_comma_ is comprised of trees for wh question on the subject_comma_ wh question on the object_comma_ relativization on the subject_comma_ relativization on the object_comma_ and so on.
E89-1001.txt,183,In the first pass_comma_ the parser loads all the trees in the tree family corresponding to an item in the input string unless certain trees in that family do not match with the feature of the head in the input string .
E89-1001.txt,184,The same tree families are used with idioms.
E89-1001.txt,185,However some trees in a family might be ruled out by an idiom if it does not satisfy one of the three following requirements.
E89-1001.txt,186,First_comma_ the tree must have slots in which the pieces of the idiom can be attached.
E89-1001.txt,187,I If one distinguishes syntactic rules that keep the lexical value of an argument in a sentence e.g. topicalization_comma_ cleft extraction_comma_ relativization... _comma_ and syntactic rules that do not deleting the node for that argument_comma_ or replacing it by a pronoun or a whelement e.g. wh question_comma_ pronominalization _comma_ it can be shown that usually only the former applies to frozen elements of an idiom.
E89-1001.txt,188,If you take the idiom bruler nn fen to run a red light _comma_ relativization and cleft extraction_comma_ but not wh question_comma_ are possible on the noun fen_comma_ with the idiomatic reading Le fen que Jean a brulg.
E89-1001.txt,189,C est nn fen que Jean a brulg. Que brule Jean
E89-1001.txt,190,Second_comma_ if all the pieces of an idiom can be attached in a tree_comma_ the order imposed by the tree must match with the order in which the pieces appear in the input string.
E89-1001.txt,191,Thus_comma_ if enfant appears before attendre in the input string_comma_ the hypothesis for an idiomatic reading will be made but only the trees corresponding to relativization_comma_ cleft exlOTllis requirement is independent of the input string.8traction_comma_ topicalization in which enfant is required to appear before attendre will be selected.
E89-1001.txt,192,But if the string enfant is not present at all ih the input string_comma_ the idiomatic reading will not be hypothesized_comma_ and trees corresponding to qui attend elle will never be selected as part of the family of the idiom attendre nn enfant.
E89-1001.txt,193,Third_comma_ the features of the heads of an idiom must unify with those imposed on the tree as for free sentences .
E89-1001.txt,194,For example_comma_ it has to be specified that bncket in to kick the bucket does not undergo relativization nor passivization_comma_ whereas tabs in to keep tabs on NP does.
E89-1001.txt,195,It is well known that even for free sentences application of the passive_comma_ for example_comma_ has somehow to be specified for each transitive verbs since there are lexical idiosyncrasies_comma_ aa The semantics of the passive tabs were kept on NP by NP is exactly the same as that of the active NP keep tabs on NP_comma_ since different trees in the same tree families are considered as semantically synonymous.
E89-1001.txt,196,7 Conclusion We have shown how idioms can be processed in lexicalized TAGs.
E89-1001.txt,197,We can access simultaneously frozen elements at different levels of depths where CFGs would either have to flatten the idiomatic structure and lose the possibility of regular insertion of modifiers or to use specific devices to check the presence of an idiom.
E89-1001.txt,198,We can also put sentential idioms in the same grammar as free sentences.
E89-1001.txt,199,The two pass parsing strategy we use combining with an operation of direct attachment of lexical items in idiomatic trees_comma_ enables us to cut down the number of idiomatic trees that the parser takes as possible candidates.
E89-1001.txt,200,We easily get possibly idiomatic and literal reading for a given sentence.
E89-1001.txt,201,The only distinctive property of idioms is the non compositional semantics of their frozen constituents.
E89-1001.txt,202,The extended domain of locality of TAGs allows the two problems of internal discontinuity and of unbounded interpositions to be handled in a nice way. .
E89-1024.txt,1,paper shows how higher levels of generalization can be introduced into unification grammars by exploiting methods for typing grammatical objects. We discuss the strategy of using global declarations to limit possible linguistic structures_comma_ and sketch a few unusual aspects of our typechecking algorithm.
E89-1024.txt,2,We also describe the sort system we use in our semantic representation language and illustrate the expressive power gained by being able to state global constraints over these sorts.
E89-1024.txt,3,Finally_comma_ we briefly illustrate the sort system by applying it to some agreement phenomena and to problems of adjunct resolution.
E89-1024.txt,5,Since Kay s seminal work Kay 1979 _comma_ the utility of unification as a general tool in computational linguistics has gained widespread recognition.
E89-1024.txt,6,One major point on which the methodology of unification grammars differs radically from that assumed by linguistic theories lies in the way they deal with generalizations that hold over the domain of description.
E89-1024.txt,7,In unification based theories_comma_ such generalizations are typically implicit_comma_ or extremely limited in their import.
E89-1024.txt,8,The reasons for this are easy to pinpoint.
E89-1024.txt,9,First_comma_ in such theories one has to be explicit about the feature structures that the grammar manipulates_comma_ and these structures have to be described more or less directly.
E89-1024.txt,10,In PATR II for example Shieber et al 1983 the only means of expressing a generalization is via the notion of template_comma_ a structure which merely represents recurring information i.e_comma_ information that The work reported here was carried out ae part of ESPRIT project P393 ACORD.
E89-1024.txt,11,A longer version of this paper can be found in Calder et a
E89-1024.txt,12,1988a . recurs in different lexical items_comma_ combination rules_comma_ lexical rules or other templates.
E89-1024.txt,13,A second reason why unification based theories do not lend themselves easily to the expression of general statements is that there is no explicit quantification in unification formalisms.
E89-1024.txt,14,In fact_comma_ every statement in these formalisms represents a simple existential constraint_comma_ never a universal generalization.
E89-1024.txt,15,The work reported here is an attempt to introduce higher levels of organization into unification grammars.
E89-1024.txt,16,The notions we employ to do this come from sorted logics and from strong data typing in programming language theory.
E89-1024.txt,17,We will show that the typing of grammatical objects offers a way of stating structural constraints on_comma_ or equivalently universal properties of_comma_ the objects that constitute the grammar.
E89-1024.txt,18,The grammatical framework in which these ideas have been implemented is Uaificatioa Categorial Grammar UCG and its semantic representation language InL_comma_ both developed as part of the ESPRIT funded project ACORD. .
E89-1033.txt,1,paper presents an algorithm for incremental chart parsing_comma_ outlines how this could be embedded in an interactive parsing system_comma_ and discusses why this might be useful. Incremental parsing here means that input i8 analysed in a piecemeal fashion_comma_ in particular allowing arbitrary changes of previous input without exhaustive reanalysis.
E89-1033.txt,2,Interactive parsing means that the analysis process is prompted immediately at the onset of new input_comma_ and possibly that the system then may interact with the user in order to resolve problems that occur.
E89-1033.txt,3,The combination of these techniques could be used as a parsing kernel for highly interactive and reactive naturallanguage processors_comma_ such as parsers for dialogue systems_comma_ interactive computer aided translation systems_comma_ and language sensitive text editors.
E89-1033.txt,4,An incremental chart parser embodying the ideas put forward in this paper has been implemented_comma_ and an embedding of this in an interactive parsing system is near completion.
E89-1033.txt,5,1 Background and .
E89-1033.txt,6,1.1 The Problem Ideally_comma_ a parser for an interactive natural language system ought to analyse input in real time in such a way that the system produces an analysis of the input while this is being received.
E89-1033.txt,7,One aspect of this is that the system should be able to gkeep up with This research has been supported by the National Swedish Board for Technical Development.
E89-1033.txt,8,The system is implemented on machines donated by the Xerox Corporation through their University Grants Program.
E89-1033.txt,9,I would like to thank several people for fruitful discussions on the topics of this paper_comma_ in particular Lars Ahrenberg also for commenting on drafts _comma_ Bernt Nilsson_comma_ and Peter Fritzson furthermore Nile D Ibiick_comma_ Arne JSnsson_comma_ Magnus Merkel_comma_ Henry Thompson_comma_ and an anonymous referee.
E89-1033.txt,10,In addition_comma_ I would like to thank Ulf Dahl n_comma_ Ass Detterfelt_comma_ Mikael Karleson_comma_ Per Larsee_comma_ Jukka Nylund_comma_ and Michael Spicar for implementing the interactive portion of LIPS. new input that_comma_ piece by piece_comma_ is entered from left to right.
E89-1033.txt,11,Another aspect is that it ought to be able to keep up also with piecemeal changes of previous input.
E89-1033.txt,12,For example_comma_ in changing one word in the beginning of some utterance s _comma_ one would not want all the input either from the beginning or from the change point to be completely reanalysed.
E89-1033.txt,13,From the perspective of efficiency as well as of modelling intelligent behaviour_comma_ the amount of processing required to analyse an update ought to be somehow correlated with the difficulty of this update.
E89-1033.txt,14,Thus_comma_ a necessary but not sufficient condition for realizing a real time parsing system as suggested above is an interactive and incremental parsing system.
E89-1033.txt,15,The goal of this paper is to develop a basic machinery for incremental chart parsing and to outline how this could be embedded in an interactive parsing system.
E89-1033.txt,16,1.2 Incremental Parsing The word incremental has been used in two differing senses in the parsing literature.
E89-1033.txt,17,The first sense stresses that input should be analysed in a piecemeal fashion_comma_ for example Bobrow and Webber 1980 _comma_ Mellish 1985 _comma_ Pulman 1085_comma_ 1987 _comma_ Hirst 1987 _comma_ Haddock 1987 .
E89-1033.txt,18,According to this view_comma_ an incremental parser constructs the analysis of an utterance bit by bit typically from left to right _comma_ rather than in one go when it has come to an end.
E89-1033.txt,19,The other sense of incremental stresses the necessity of e ciently handling arbitrary changes within current input.
E89-1033.txt,20,Thus_comma_ according to this view_comma_ an incremental parser should be able to efficiently handle not only piecemeal additions to a sentence_comma_ but_comma_ more generally_comma_ arbitrary insertions and deletions in it.
E89-1033.txt,21,This view of incremental parsing is typical of research on interactive programming environments_comma_ e.g.
E89-1033.txt,22,Lindstrom 1970 _comma_ Earley and Caisergues 1972 _comma_ Ghezzi and Mandrioli 1979_comma_ 1980 _comma_ Reps and Teitelbaum 1987 .
E89-1033.txt,23,As indicated above_comma_ we are here interested in the latter view_comma_ which we summarize in the following working definition.
E89-1033.txt,24,241 Incremental parser.
E89-1033.txt,25,A parser capable of handling changes of previous input while expending an amount of effort which is proportional to the complexity of the changes.
E89-1033.txt,26,1 It should be pointed out that we are here limiting ourselves to a machinery for incremental parsing as opposed to incremental interpretation.
E89-1033.txt,27,In other words_comma_ the derivation of an utterance here takes into account only ontext free lexical_comma_ syntactic_comma_ compositional semantic information obtained from grammar and dictionary.
E89-1033.txt,28,Nevertheless_comma_ I believe that this framework may be of some value also when approaching the more difficult problem of incremental interpretation.
E89-1033.txt,29,1.3 Interactive Parsing We adopt the following working definition.
E89-1033.txt,31,Synonym on line parser. A parser which monitors a text input process_comma_ starting to parse immediately at the onset of new input_comma_ thereby achieving enhanced efficiency as well as a potential for dynamic improvement of its performance_comma_ for example by promptly reporting errors_comma_ asking for clarifications_comma_ etc. 2 Within the area of programming environments_comma_ generators for language based editors have been developed that make use of interactive and incremental parsing and compilation to perform program analysis_comma_ to report errors_comma_ and to generate code while the program is being edited_comma_ for example Mentor_comma_ Gandalf_comma_ and the Synthesizer Generator Reps and Teitelbanm 1987 .
E89-1033.txt,32,Within natural language processing_comma_ Tomita 1985 and Yonezawa and Ohsawa 1988 have reported parsers which operate on line_comma_ but_comma_ incidentally_comma_ not incrementally in the sense adopted here.
E89-1033.txt,33,3 IThis definition is formed partly in analogy with a definition of incremental compilation by Earley and Caizergues 1972 1040 .
E89-1033.txt,34,We use complexity instead of size because different updates of the same size may cause differing processing efforts depending on the degree of grammatical complexity ambiguity_comma_ context sensitiveness constraining the updates in question.
E89-1033.txt,35,21ncidentally_comma_ interactive parsing could be seen as one example of a general trend towards imrnatiate computation Reps and Teitelbaum 1987 31 _comma_ also manifest in applications such as WYSIWYG word processing and spreadsheet programs_comma_ and sparked off by the availability of personal workstations with dedicated processors.
E89-1033.txt,36,SThe user may delete input from right to left_comma_ causing the systems to Uunparsen this input.
E89-1033.txt,37,This means that if the user wants to update some small fragment in the beginning of a sentence_comma_ the system has to reparse exhaustively from this update and on.
E89-1033.txt,38,Of course_comma_ in reality the user has to first backspace and then retype everything from the change. 1.4 Outline of Paper Section 2 presents an algorithm for incremental chart parsing.
E89-1033.txt,39,Section 3 discusses some additional aspects and alternative strategies.
E89-1033.txt,40,Section 4 gives a brief outline of the combined interactive and incremental parsing system_comma_ and section 5 summarizes the conclusions.
E89-1033.txt,41,2 Incremental Chart Parsing 2.1 Chart Parsing The incremental parser has been grounded in a chart parsing framework Kay 1980_comma_ Thompson 1981_comma_ Thompson and Ritchie 1984 for the following reasons chart parsing is an efficient_comma_ open ended_comma_ well understood_comma_ and frequently adopted technique in natural language processing chart parsing gives us a previously unexplored possibility of embedding incrementality at a low cost.
E89-1033.txt,42,2.2 Edge Dependencies The idea of incremental chart parsing_comma_ as put forward here_comma_ is based on the following observation The chart_comma_ while constituting a record of partial analyses chart edges _comma_ may easily be provided with information also about the dependencies between those analyses.
E89-1033.txt,43,This is just what we need in incremental parsing since we want to propagate the effects of a change precisely to those parts of the previous analysis that_comma_ directly or indirectly_comma_ depend on the updated information.
E89-1033.txt,44,In what ways could chart edges be said to depend on each other
E89-1033.txt,45,Put simply_comma_ an edge depends upon another edge if it is formed using the latter edge.
E89-1033.txt,46,Thus_comma_ an edge formed through a prediction step depends on the one edge that triggered it.
E89-1033.txt,47,4 Likewise_comma_ an edge formed through a combination 5 depends on the active inactive edge pair that generated it.
E89-1033.txt,48,A scanned edge_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ does not depend upon any other edge_comma_ as scanning can be seen as a kind of initialization of the chart_comma_ e In order to account for edge dependencies we associate with each edge the set of its immediate source 4In the case of an initial top down prediction_comma_ the source would be non existent.
E89-1033.txt,49,SThe raldeter operation in Earley 1970 the ndarnentad rule in Thompson 1981 2 . sit might be argued that a dependency should be established also in the case of an edge being proposed but rejected owing to a redundancy test because it already exists.
E89-1033.txt,50,However_comma_ as long as updates affect all preterminal edges extending from a vertex_comma_ this appears not to be crucial.
E89-1033.txt,51,242 edges back pointers .
E89-1033.txt,52,This information could be used to derive the corresponding sets of dependent edges gforward pointers that we are interested in.
E89-1033.txt,53,For example_comma_ when a word in the previous input has been deleted_comma_ we want to remove all edges which depend on the preterminal lexical edge s corresponding to this word_comma_ as well as those preterminal edges themselves.
E89-1033.txt,54,Formally_comma_ let P be a binary dependency relation such that e P e if and only if e t is a dependant of e_comma_ i.e._comma_ e has been formed directly using e.
E89-1033.txt,55,If D is the reflexive transitive closure of P_comma_ all edges e should be removed for which e D e holds_comma_ i.e._comma_ all edges which directly or indirectly depend on e_comma_ as well as e itself.
E89-1033.txt,56,In addition_comma_ we are going to make use of the transitive closure of D_comma_ D .
E89-1033.txt,57,The resulting style of incremental parsing resembles truth or reason maintenance_comma_ in particular ATMS de Kleer 1986 .
E89-1033.txt,58,A chart edge here corresponds to an ATMS node_comma_ a preterminal edge corresponds to an assurnption node_comma_ the immediate source information of an edge corresponds to a justification_comma_ the dependency relation D provides information corresponding to ATMS labels_comma_ etc. 2.3 Technical Preliminaries 2.3.1 The Chart The chart is a directed graph.
E89-1033.txt,59,The nodes_comma_ or vertices_comma_ vl_comma_ ..._comma_ Vn l correspond to the positions surrounding the words of an n word sentence t01 .. ton.
E89-1033.txt,60,A pair of vertices vl_comma_vy may be connected by arcs_comma_ or edges_comma_ bearing information about partially analysed constituents between v and vy.
E89-1033.txt,61,We will take an edge to be a tuple s_comma_ t_comma_ X0  a. _comma_ D_comma_ E starting from vertex v and ending at vertex vt with dotted rule X0 a. a dag D cf. section 2.3.3 _comma_ and the set of immediately dependent edges_comma_ E. s In order to lay the ground for easy splitting and joining of chart fragments_comma_ we will take a vertex to consist of three parts_comma_ L_comma_ Aioop_comma_ R _comma_ left_comma_ middle_comma_ and right.
E89-1033.txt,62,L and R will have internal structure_comma_ so that the full vertex structure will come out like The left part_comma_ Ain_comma_ Ii _comma_ consists of the incoming active and inactive edges which will remain with the left portion of the chart when it is split due VA dotted rule Xo  a. corresponds to an active X0 edge containing an analysis of constituent s a_comma_ requiring constituent s in order to yield an inactive edge.
E89-1033.txt,63,Sin other words_comma_ the set E of an edge e consists of all edges el for which e P el holds. to some internal sentence editing operation.
E89-1033.txt,64,Correspondingly_comma_ the right part_comma_ Aost_comma_ Io_comma_t _comma_ consists of the outgoing active and inactive edges which will remain with the right portion of the chart.
E89-1033.txt,65,The middle part_comma_ Aioop_comma_ consists of the active looping edges which_comma_ depending on the rule invocation strategy_comma_ should remain either with the left or the right portion of the chart cf. section 3.1 .
E89-1033.txt,66,We will make use of dots for qualifying within elements of tuples.
E89-1033.txt,67,For example_comma_ e.s will stand for the starting vertex of edge e.
E89-1033.txt,68,Likewise_comma_ vi.L will stand for the set of edges belonging to the left half of vertex number i_comma_ and vi.Ai will denote the set of its active incoming edges.
E89-1033.txt,69,In addition_comma_ we will use vi.Po t as a shorthand for the set of inactive outgoing edges at vi which are also preterminal lexical .
E89-1033.txt,70,2.3.2 Editing Operations In general_comma_ parsing could be seen as a mapping from a sentence to a structure representing the analysis of the sentence in this case a chart.
E89-1033.txt,71,Incremental parsing requires a more complex mapping F ._comma_ _comma_ r_comma_ Co cl from an edit operation 7_comma_ a pair of cursor positions _comma_ a sequence of words r empty in the case of deletion _comma_ and an initial chart Co to a new chart cl and using a grammar and dictionary as usual .
E89-1033.txt,72,We are going to assume three kinds of editing operation_comma_ insert_comma_ delete_comma_ and replace.
E89-1033.txt,73,Furthermore_comma_ we assume that every operation applies to a continuous sequence of words tot.._comma_ tot_comma_ each of which maps to one or several preterminal edges extending from vertices vt_comma_ .._comma_ vr_comma_ respectively. Thus_comma_ may here take the values insert_comma_ delete_comma_ or replace is a pair of positions l_comma_ r such that the sequence of positions l_comma_ ..._comma_ r map directly to vertices vi_comma_ ..._comma_ W_comma_ and r is the corresponding sequence of words wt... tot.
E89-1033.txt,74,In addition_comma_ we will make use of the constant 6 r l 1_comma_ denoting the number of words affected by the editing operation.
E89-1033.txt,75,2.8.3 Grammatical Formalism In the algorithm below_comma_ as well as in the actual implementation_comma_ we have adopted a unification based grammatical formalism with a context free base_comma_ PATR Shieber et al. 1983_comma_ Shieber 1986 _comma_ because this seems to be the best candidate for a lingua ranca in current natural language processing.
E89-1033.txt,76,However_comma_ this formalism here shows up only within the edges_comma_ where we have an extra dag element D _comma_ and when referring to rules_comma_ each of which consists of a Character editing is processed by the scanner cf. section 3.3.
E89-1033.txt,77,243 pair IX0 _comma_ D of a production and a dag.
E89-1033.txt,78,In the dag representation of the rule_comma_ we will store the context free base under cat features as usual.
E89-1033.txt,79,We assume that the grammar is cycle free.
E89-1033.txt,80,2.4 An Algorithm for Incremental Chart Parsing 2.4.1 .
E89-1023.txt,1,paper discusses the application of a previously reported theory of explanation rhetoric Maybury_comma_ 1988b to the task of explaining constraint violations in a hybrid rule frame based system for resource allocation Dawson et al_comma_ 1987 . This research illustrates how discourse strategies of explanation_comma_ textual connectives_comma_ and additional justification knowledge can be applied to enhance the cohesiveness_comma_ structure_comma_ and clarity of knowledge based system explanations. .
E89-1023.txt,2,Recent work in text generation includes emphasis on producing textual presentations of the explanations of reasoning in knowledge based systems.
E89-1023.txt,3,Initial work Swartout_comma_ 1981 on the direct translation of underlying system knowledge led to insights that more perspicuous justifications would result from keeping track of the principles or deep causal models which supported that knowledge Swartout and Smoliar_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1023.txt,4,And experiments with discourse strategies demonstrated the efficacy of the rhetorical organization of knowledge to produce descriptions_comma_ comparisons McKeown_comma_ 1985 and clarification McCoy_comma_ 1985 .
E89-1023.txt,5,Researchers have recently observed Paris et al_comma_ 1988 that the line of explanation should not isomorphically mirror the underlying line of reasoning as this often resulted in poorly connected text Appelt_comma_ 1982 .
E89-1023.txt,6,Others have attempted to classify patterns of explanations Stevens and Steinberg_comma_ 1981 Schank_comma_ 1986 .
E89-1023.txt,7,The approach presented here is to exploit generic explanation strategies and focus models Sidner_comma_ 1983 Grosz and Sidner_comma_ 1988 to organize the back end justification via an explanation rhetoric that is_comma_ a rhetorical model of strategies that humans employ to persuade_comma_ support_comma_ or clarify their position.
E89-1023.txt,8,The result is a more connected_comma_ flowing and thus easier to follow textual presentation of the explanation.
E89-1023.txt,9,KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION and EXPLANATION Previous research in natural language generation from knowledge based systems has primarily focused on independent knowledge representation schemes e.g rule_comma_ frame or conceptual dependency formalisms .
E89-1023.txt,10,In contrast_comma_ the application chosen to test the concepts of rhetorical explanations is an FRL Roberts and Goldstein_comma_ 1977 based mission planning system for the Air Force which utilizes both rules and frames during decision making.
E89-1023.txt,11,Hence_comma_ the explanations concern rule based constraint violations which result from inference about entities in the knowledge base_comma_ their attributes_comma_ and relationships.
E89-1023.txt,12,For example_comma_ if the user plans an offensive counter air mission with an incompatible aircraft and target_comma_ the system will automatically signal a constraint violation via highlighting of objects on the screen.
E89-1023.txt,13,If the user mouses for explanation_comma_ the system will state the conflicting rule_comma_ then list the supporting knowledge_comma_ as shown in figure 1.
E89-1023.txt,14,168 The choice for AIRCRAFT is in question because BY TARGET AIRCRAFr 1 1 THERE IS A SEVERE CONFLICT BETWEEN TARGET AND AIRCRAFT FOR OCA10022 1.
E89-1023.txt,15,THE TARGET OF OCA1002 IS BE307033 2.

E89-1023.txt,17,THE AIRCRAFT OF OCA1002 IS F 111E 4.
E89-1023.txt,18,F 111E IS NOT A F 4G Figure 1.
E89-1023.txt,19,Current Explanation of Rule Violation The weak textuality of the presentation manifests itself through ungrammatical sentences and the implicit suggestion of relationships among entities_comma_ placing the burden of organization upon the reader.
E89-1023.txt,20,Moreover_comma_ it lacks essential content that specifies why an F 111E is not acceptable.

E89-1023.txt,22,The explanation trace is of the form rule constraint justification knowledge type justification content support code  where means 1 to N repetitions.

E89-1023.txt,24,Audit Trail of One reason the text lacks coherence is because it fails to specify precise relationships among introduced entities.
E89-1023.txt,25,This can be achieved not only by sequential order_comma_ but through the use of models of rhetoric_comma_ textual connectives_comma_ and discourse devices such as anaphora and pronominal modifiers.
E89-1023.txt,26,For instance_comma_ rather than achieving organization from some model of naturally occurring discourse_comma_ the presentation is isomorphic to the underlying inference chain.
E89-1023.txt,27,In figure 1_comma_ the first two sentences are 1This is the name of the rule.

E89-1023.txt,31,Notice that the AIRCRAFT OCA1002 F 111E tuple is followed by a lisp code test for inequality of F 111E and F 4G aircraft.
E89-1023.txt,32,It is unclear indeed unspecified in this formalism that the reason for this test and the preference for an F 4G is its ability to handle search radar.
E89-1023.txt,33,Thus_comma_ discrimination of the two aircraft on the basis of structure_comma_ function_comma_ capability or some other characteristic would further clarify the explanation.
E89-1023.txt,34,Therefor_comma_ there is a need not only for linguistic processing to enhance the coherence of the presentation in figure 1_comma_ but also additional knowledge to enhance the perspicuity of the explanation.
E89-1023.txt,35,169 EXPLANATION RHETORIC The implemented system_comma_ EXPLAN_comma_ exploits models of rhetorical strategies_comma_ focus models_comma_ as well as entity distinguishing knowledge to improve the organization_comma_ connectivity and surface choices e.g. connectives and anaphor of the text.
E89-1023.txt,36,The system first instantiates a pool of relevant explanation propositions from both the explanation audit trail as well as from the knowledge base as both are sources of valuable clarifying information.
E89-1023.txt,37,The text planner uses a predicate selection algorithm guided by a global and local focus model_comma_ knowledge of rhetorical ordering_comma_ relationships among entities in the knowledge base_comma_ and the explanation audit trail to select and order propositions which are then realized via a case semantics_comma_ a relational grammar_comma_ and finally morphological synthesis algorithms Maybury_comma_ 1988a .
E89-1023.txt,38,In our example_comma_ the first task is to determine the salience of entities to the explanation.
E89-1023.txt,39,The generator includes the current frame that is_comma_ the current mission being planned_comma_ OCA1002 in the global focus of attention.
E89-1023.txt,40,However_comma_ global focus also must include those slots which may have relevance to constraint violations.
E89-1023.txt,41,Figure 3 shows the OCA1002 mission frame which has many slots_comma_ only a few of which are central to the explanation_comma_ namely the AIRCRAFT and TARGET slots.
E89-1023.txt,42,A selection algorithm filters out semantically irrelevant slots e.g. AIO_comma_ DISPLAY and retains slots trapped by the constraint violation.
E89-1023.txt,43,Salient objects in the knowledge base are marked_comma_ including the parent and children of the object s in question which are explicitly in focus and the siblings or cousins of the global focus which are implicitly in focus .
E89-1023.txt,44,After selecting the global focus OCA1002_comma_ AIRCRAFT_comma_ and TARGET _comma_ and marking salient objects in the knowledge base_comma_ the planner selects three propositions from the instantiated pool guided by the local focus model and the model of explanation discourse.
E89-1023.txt,45,The proposition pool includes previously reported McKeown_comma_ 1985 rhetorical types such as attributive_comma_ constituent_comma_ and illustration_comma_ but also includes a wide range of justificatory rhetorical predicate types such as characteristic_comma_ componential_comma_ classificatory_comma_ physical causal_comma_ generalization_comma_ associative_comma_ and functional_comma_ as reported in Maybury_comma_ 1988b .
E89-1023.txt,46,These predicates are grouped into subschema as to whether they identify the problem_comma_ support the identification or diagnosis_comma_ or recommend actions.
E89-1023.txt,47,These sub strategies_comma_ which provide global rhetorical coherence_comma_ can expand to a range of predicate types such as the three chosen in the example plan.

E89-1023.txt,52,The corresponding instantiated rhetorical propositions are shown in figure 5.
E89-1023.txt,53,The problem to be identified in our illustration is that there is a conflict between the aircraft and the target chosen in the mission plan.
E89-1023.txt,54,As this is indicated by highlighting of these slots on the screen_comma_ identification of the conflict is not included in the text_comma_ although there is no reason why this could not be explicitly stated by means of a definition predicate.
E89-1023.txt,55,With the problem identified_comma_ the planner justifies this identification by characterizing the mission under consideration and classifying the object at the root of the constraint violation.
E89-1023.txt,56,Finally_comma_ the planner recommends a viable alternative using a suggestive proposition.
E89-1023.txt,57,Notice that the discriminatory knowledge in the suggestive predicate in figure 5 from the knowledge base 1 rather than the explanation trace.

E89-1010.txt,1,present a cost based or energy based model of disambiguation. When a sentence is ambiguous_comma_ a parse with the least cost is chosen from among multiple hypotheses.
E89-1010.txt,2,Each hypothesis is assigned a cost which is added when 1 a new instance is created to satisfy reference success_comma_ 2 links between instances are created or removed to satisfy constraints on concept sequences_comma_ and 3 a concept node with insufficient priming is used for further processing.
E89-1010.txt,3,This method of ambiguity resolution is implemented in DMT NS PLUS_comma_ which is a second generation bi direetional English Japanese machine translation system based on a massively parallel spreading activation paradigm developed at the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie Mellon University.

E89-1010.txt,5,Under the DMA paradigm_comma_ the mental state of the hearer is modelled by a massively parallel network representing memory.
E89-1010.txt,6,Parsing is performed by passing markers in the memory network.
E89-1010.txt,7,In our model_comma_ the meaning of a sentence is viewed as modifications made to the memory network.
E89-1010.txt,8,The meaning of a sentence in our model is definable as the difference in the memory network before and after understanding the sentence.
E89-1010.txt,9,2 Limitations of Current Methods of Ambiguity Resolution 1 .
E89-1010.txt,10,One of the central issues in natural language understanding research is ambiguity resolution.
E89-1010.txt,11,Since many sentences are ambiguous out of context_comma_ techniques for ambiguity resolution have been an important topic in natural language understanding.
E89-1010.txt,12,In this paper_comma_ we describe a model of ambiguity resolution implemented in DMTRANS PLUS_comma_ which is a next generation machine translation system based on a massively parallel comuputational paradigm.
E89-1010.txt,13,In our model_comma_ ambiguities are resolved by evaluating the cost of each hypothesis the hypothesis with the least cost will be selected.
E89-1010.txt,14,Costs are assigned when 1 a new instance is ereated to satisfy reference success_comma_ 2 links between instances are created or removed to satisfy constraints on concept sequences_comma_ and 3 a concept node with insufficient priming is used for further processing.
E89-1010.txt,15,The underlying philosophy of the model is to view parsing as a dynamic physical process in which one trajectory is taken from among many other possible paths.
E89-1010.txt,16,Thus our notion of the cost of the hypothesis is a representation of the workload required to take the path representing the hypothesis.
E89-1010.txt,17,One other important idea is that our model employs the direct memory E mail address is hiroaki a.nl.cs.cmu.edu.

E89-1036.txt,1,framework for translating speaker s meaning or intention is proposed based on two notions_comma_ Illocutionary Force Types IFTs for analysis and Decision Parameters DPs for generation. IFTs are a certain kind of classification of utterances concerning speaker s meaning.
E89-1036.txt,2,DPs present background information of language use in order to derive an appropriate expression from speaker s meaning.
E89-1036.txt,3,In Japanese_comma_ IFTs can be derived automatically through syntactical constraints.
E89-1036.txt,4,To generate appropriate expressions_comma_ language specific communication strategies related to DP values should be given a priori.
E89-1036.txt,5,The whole process is performed in a unification based framework.
E89-1036.txt,7,In devising a machine translation system of telephone dialogues_comma_ one of the problems is how to adequately translate tile underlying meaning of the source utterance_comma_ or the speaker s intention_comma_ into the target language.
E89-1036.txt,8,Such a concern is rarely observed in conventional machine translation research_comma_ which has focused on strictly grammatical translation divorced from consideration of the speaker s situation and intentions Tsujii and Nagao 1988 .
E89-1036.txt,9,However_comma_ in dialogue_comma_ smoothness of communication depends on perceiving the speaker s intention.
E89-1036.txt,10,Especially when dealing with different language family pairs such as Japanese and English_comma_ it is necessary to have a methodology of treating language specific communication strategies in a universal framework.
E89-1036.txt,11,Although the input of our machine translation system is spoken dialogue_comma_ here we leave aside the issues of speech processing and limit our discussion to linguistic processing.
E89-1036.txt,12,Extragrammatical sentence patterns such as intrasentential correction_comma_ stammering_comma_ and inversion are not treated either.
E89-1036.txt,13,Our framework for translating speaker s intention is based on two notions_comma_ Illoeutionary Force Types IFTs _comma_ i.e. a classification of the speaker s intentions_comma_ and Decision Parameters DPs _comma_ i.e. features representing different factors relevant to speechact related expressions.
E89-1036.txt,14,Though plan based approaches to speech acts such as Allen and Perrault 1980 are ideal_comma_ too little is known in this field to apply it to actual natural language processing.
E89-1036.txt,15,Therefore_comma_ we adopt here a moderate_comma_ intrascntential_comma_ syntactic method that can serve as further input to plan based approaches.
E89-1036.txt,16,In section 2 of this paper we discuss the relation between intention and speech act indirectness_comma_ and call intention thus described speaker s meaning. In section 3 we define IFTs.
E89-1036.txt,17,In section 4 we fully utilize syntactic constraints in Japanese in order to extract II rs from input utterances.
E89-1036.txt,18,In section 5 we present DPs as strategies for expressing IFTs in the target language.
E89-1036.txt,19,Finally_comma_ we make conclusions on this framework.
E89-1036.txt,21,Speaker s meaning in an utterance 2.1.
E89-1036.txt,22,What Is speaker s meaning
E89-1036.txt,23,When the speaker utters a sentence_comma_ the hearer receives communicative signs in addition to propositional content.
E89-1036.txt,24,According to speech act theory_comma_ these signs are classified as illocutionary forces governed by certain felicity conditions Searle 1969 .
E89-1036.txt,25,Speech act theory is one of the main themes of pragmatics_comma_ but it remains too conceptual to be of practical assistance to natural language processing.
E89-1036.txt,26,However_comma_ illocutionary forces can be useful to machine translation if propositional content is distinguished from structure in the analysis of intention.
E89-1036.txt,27,264We begin by noting that intentions and surface expressions have multiple correspondences.
E89-1036.txt,28,As the following example shows_comma_ a single surface expression can convey several intentions 2 1 gakusei waribiki wa nai no desy6 ks student discount TOP exist NOT EXPL POL QUEST Isn t there a student discount ll
E89-1036.txt,29,REQUESTING COMPLAINING ADVISING CONFIRMING ...etc. Conversely_comma_ the same intention can be conveyed through various surface expressions_comma_ as in the following variations of 2 1 REQUESTING Ill 2 2 gakusei waribiki o site kudasai. student discount OBJ make do GIVFAV POL IMP Please make me a student discount.

E89-1036.txt,35,Concerning a discount request_comma_ 2 2 seems a bit strong for a real situation although there is no specific contexttml condition to decide definitely if it is or not.
E89-1036.txt,36,2 1 2 3 and 2 4 are seen in our data.
E89-1036.txt,37,These examples clearly show that intention is context dependent_comma_ and that to understand the speaker s meaning correctly_comma_ an inference mechanism is necessary.
E89-1036.txt,38,Various surface expression patterns give clues for ascertaining illocutionary forces Wierzbicka 1986 .
E89-1036.txt,39,2 5 t rokuydsi o o okuri negae masu ks registration form OBJ send POL desire POL QUEST Can you please send me a registration form7 2 6 Could you kindly send them all together
E89-1036.txt,40,Hegau in 2 5 _comma_ a verb for request_comma_ and ks_comma_ the sentence final particle of questions_comma_ indicate request.
E89-1036.txt,41,Kindly in 2 6 signals a request in English.
E89-1036.txt,42,In other words_comma_ even without knowledge of the context of an utterance_comma_ knowledge of communicstive strategies of language and their expression patterns allow the derivation of intentions from utterances.
E89-1036.txt,43,In the above examples_comma_ we can see there are various ways of expressing requests.
E89-1036.txt,44,This indirectness derives from social patterns in requesting things common to all cultures to some degree.
E89-1036.txt,45,On the other hand_comma_ however_comma_ it depends on each specific society.
E89-1036.txt,46,In this paper we accept indirectness as an unavoidable and basic feature of spoken utterances_comma_ and deal with indirect patterns such in 2 1 and 2 3 that will be called speech act indirectness.
E89-1036.txt,47,Indirect expressions such as 2 4 _comma_ which are called propositional indirectness_comma_ are not treated for the reason given in the next subsection.
E89-1036.txt,48,We use the term speaker s meaning to refer to intention expressed by speech act indirectness.
E89-1036.txt,49,Using this notion_comma_ we try to capture syntactically the major portion of speech act related expressions in spoken Japanese.
E89-1036.txt,51,Translation of speaker s meaning We assume that for machine translation it is sufficient to understand utterances on the level of speech act indirectness_comma_ without referring to propositional indirectness.
E89-1036.txt,52,On the one hand_comma_ when there is a large degree of indirectness such as the omission of propositional content in 2 4 where the topic discount fee for students is not actually mentioned_comma_ we must be content with a direct translation of what has been stated.
E89-1036.txt,53,This is because a sentence based translation cannot compensate for the missing content.
E89-1036.txt,54,In addition_comma_ since the hearer will no doubt be able to infer something about the omitted content anyway_comma_ the speaker is best served by a direct translation closest to the original.
E89-1036.txt,55,On the other hand_comma_ when the propositional content is explicitly phrased but requires indirectness to make an appropriate translation into the target language_comma_ a system that concentrates on speech act indirectness will again be tile most useful_comma_ because socio linguistic differences will be expressed typically in speechact indirectness as in 2 1 and 2 3 .
E89-1036.txt,56,Consequently_comma_ we develop a framework aimed at extracting speaker s meaning in terms of speechact indirectness.
E89-1036.txt,58,I FTs 3.1.Classiflcatlon of IFTs An experiment has been carried out on collected data of spoken style inter terminal dialogues to extract illocutionary acts.
E89-1036.txt,59,The subject of the conversations was limited to 265 application for an international conference_comma_ and the content was mainly on inquiry_comma_ request_comma_ and confirmation about the conference between a secretary and an applicant.
E89-1036.txt,60,We classify surface IFTs into six types Table 1 .
E89-1036.txt,61,This is the immediate result of the analysis made intrasententially by means of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar HPSG Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar JPSG .
E89-1036.txt,62,The six types are differentiated from each other only by means of the uppermost predicate value that is the result of the surface based analysis.
E89-1036.txt,63,For example_comma_ an indirect request with an interrogative sentence pattern such as 2 5 t6rokuySsi o o okuri negae masu ha
E89-1036.txt,64,Could you please send me a registration form is classified simply as an INTERROGATIVE type_comma_ though it is OPTATIVE at the deep IFT level.
E89-1036.txt,65,Also_comma_ a sentence with an active_comma_ presenttense verb such as 3 1 tdrohuyOsi o o ohuri si masu registration form OBJ send POL do POL I will send you a registration form. is analyzed as INFORMATIVE_comma_ though it is PROMISE at the deep level.

E89-1036.txt,69,In 3 4 _comma_ the third member of the SUBCAT value specifies the conjugational form and modality type of the complement verb.
E89-1036.txt,70,The feature MODL imposes conditions on the modality type that plays a key role in Japanese syntax by dominating mutual predicate component subcategorization and subordination.
E89-1036.txt,73,On the one hand_comma_ IFTs SUBJECTIVE and OPTATIVE are universally limited to expressions with first person singular subject and present tense and without modal information_comma_ and Japanese surface predicates reflect these restrictions very well.
E89-1036.txt,74,Also_comma_ OPTATIVE is limited to second person recipient.
E89-1036.txt,75,For example_comma_ 4 6 SBJ kaigi ni mdsikomi tai. conference OBJ2 reserve want I would like to register for the conference.
E89-1036.txt,76,4 7 SBJ kaigi ni mdsikomi tai sd do.
E89-1036.txt,77,conferenceOBJ2 reserve want l hear I hear someone wants to register for the conference.
E89-1036.txt,78,While sentence 4 6 with the present_comma_ non modal auxiliary tai want to belongs to the SUBJECTIVE type_comma_ 4 7 with the evidential modality belongs to the ASSER ITVE type.
E89-1036.txt,79,This fact is utilized_comma_ by means of two lexical descriptions of tai and IFT Schemata restricting the decomposition members person_comma_ tense_comma_ and modal information_comma_ to identify the omitted subject of 4 6 as the first person_comma_ and that of 4 7 as the third person.
E89-1036.txt,80,On the other hand_comma_ adverbials that exclusively modify deep IFTs are also utilized in disambiguating IFTs_comma_ For example_comma_ a sentence with O Regal simasu request_comma_ implore is ambiguous among OPTATIVE_comma_ ASSERTIVE_comma_ and PROMISE.
E89-1036.txt,81,If it is modified by dEzo please _comma_ however_comma_ the sentence is always an OPI ATIVE type.
E89-1036.txt,82,Deep IFTs with their corresponding syntactic constraints are diagramed by Table 2.
E89-1036.txt,83,Instances in the Table indicate each of the corresponding deep IFTs_comma_ but the opposite is not necessarily true.
E89-1036.txt,84,For example_comma_ a deep IFT OPTATIVE can be indicated by complex predicates that belong to the surface category INTERROGATIVE or ASSERTIVE.

E89-1036.txt,99,Necessity of DPs We can summarize the difference between Japanese and English communication behavior as follows Japanese interpersonal relation is the most essential factor English interpersonal relation is essential_comma_ but how to convey or read intentions is more important For example_comma_ 5 1 is an utterance from a boss to a secretary to request him to work overtime.
E89-1036.txt,100,This Japanese utterance is not an order because it is expressed in a polite way using the negative interrogative.
E89-1036.txt,101,This kind of request is not unusual in Japanese because of the priority given to social standing.
E89-1036.txt,102,Because Japanese think a request phrased like this is normal_comma_ the English translation shown in 5 1 using can and sorry seems appropriate to them_comma_ too.
E89-1036.txt,103,But actually an appropriate translation requires a more polite expression that addresses the secretary s inconvenience_comma_ as in 5 1 .
E89-1036.txt,104,Thus_comma_ to get an appropriate translation of 5 1 _comma_ we must reconsider from the viewpoint of the target language interpersonal relations between the speaker and the hearer and the inconvenience of requested action for the hearer.

E89-1036.txt,106,5 1 Do you think you could possibly stay late to type these documents
E89-1036.txt,107,To resolve these communicative differences between Japanese and English_comma_ we assume four kinds of parameterlzed factors_comma_ which we call Decision Parameters DPs .
E89-1036.txt,108,These are interpersonal relation_comma_ cost benefit relation_comma_ definiteness of propositional content_comma_ and topicality of propositional content.
E89-1036.txt,109,Interpersonal relation indicates the situational relationship between utterance participants as constituted by age_comma_ social status_comma_ familiarity_comma_ gender_comma_ and the other factors governing use of Japanese honorifics.
E89-1036.txt,110,Cost benefit relation indicates whether the action intended by the speaker s utterance is convenient to the speaker or to the hearer.
E89-1036.txt,111,Definiteness of propositional content means whether propositional content is routine or easily performed work_comma_ or whether it requires additional or unusual work.
E89-1036.txt,112,Topicality of propositional content is related to the position of an utterance in discourse_comma_ which means whether or not the speaker s intention is already implied.
E89-1036.txt,113,Table 4 shows these four parameters and their values.
E89-1036.txt,114,In particular_comma_ DP4 or topicality presents discourse information which affects the politeness level of surface expressions.
E89-1036.txt,115,In the present experimental situation_comma_ extraction of speaker s meaning is limited to isolated utterances separate from discourse structure_comma_ but 269 to get appropriate expressions in generation_comma_ we need DP4 in connection with a discourse model.

E89-1036.txt,120,Selection of surface IFT by referring to I P values In the plan inference method of generation_comma_ we use DPs in order to get appropriate English surface IFTs to convey IFTs in English.
E89-1036.txt,121,Since we are limiting the input to a task oriented domain like conferences_comma_ we can re state input in terms of propositional content.
E89-1036.txt,122,This propositional content is then measured in terms of the three DP values as a default Table 5 .
E89-1036.txt,126,We suppose that differences between Japanese and English consist in the different amount of DPs we should refer to when extracting surface IFTs.
E89-1036.txt,127,Japanese surface IFTs will be concerned with DP1 and DP2 since Japanese expressions do not stress speaker s intention_comma_ whereas English surface IFTs will range over all four DPs and produce a larger range of appropriate translation choices.
E89-1036.txt,128,For example_comma_ 1 and 7 ofTable 5 which differ in definiteness of propositional content i.e. routine or unusual _comma_ can be generated in the same way in Japanese_comma_ which involves only DP1 and DP2.

E89-1036.txt,130,In case 7 _comma_ to convey the unusual but really necessary picking up request_comma_ an adequate expression requires more politeness.

E89-1036.txt,132,The mapping from Japanese surface IFT to English surface IFT is schematized as in Table 6.
E89-1036.txt,133,We can categorize English request expressions into two kinds.
E89-1036.txt,134,One is direct expressions with please_comma_ which we call PLEASE_comma_ and others are expressions containing several levels of politeness such as could you... _comma_ is it possible to... _comma_ I am wondering_comma_ etc._comma_ which we call PLEASE PLUS.
E89-1036.txt,135,Japanese surface IFTs are separated into two types_comma_ INTERROGATIVE and others_comma_ i.e. declarative requests using OPTATIVE_comma_ SUBJECTIVE or ASSERTIVE type.
E89-1036.txt,136,When a Japanese surface IFT is INTERROGATIVE as in 5 4 and 5 5 _comma_ and if the IFT is already implied in preceding utterances_comma_ the English surface IFT can be 270expressed simply with PLEASE type as in 5 4 and 5 5 _comma_ otherwise it should be expressed in PLEASE PLUS type such as several kinds of English speech act indirectness as in 5 4 and 5 5 .
E89-1036.txt,137,On the other hand_comma_ when the Japanese surface IFT is others such as OPTATIVE or SUBJECTIVE as in 5 2 and 5 3 _comma_ and if IFT is already implied in preceding utterances_comma_ the English surface IFT should be expressed in PLEASE PLUS as in 5 2 and 5 3 .

E89-1036.txt,145,Thus_comma_ the politeness levels of English surface IFTs in terms of speech act indirectness are appropriately generated by clarifying the relation between English surface IFTs and DPs.
E89-1036.txt,147,Conclusion We proposed in this paper a descriptive framework for translating speaker s meaning in a dialogue translation system.
E89-1036.txt,148,This framework is based on two notions_comma_ Illocutionary Force types and Decision Parameters_comma_ and is aimed at extracting speaker s meaning in terms of speechact indirectness since we believe that propositional and speech act indirectness must both be processed separately.

E89-1029.txt,1,propose an apparently minor extension to Kay s 1985 notation for describing directed acyclic graphs DAGs . The proposed notation permits concise descriptions of phenomena which would otherwise be difficult to describe_comma_ without incurring significant extra computational overheads in the process of unification. We illustrate the notation with examples from a categorial description of a fragment of English_comma_ and discuss the computational properties of unification of DAGs specified in this way. argue that our extension makes it possible to describe any phenomena which could not have been described at all using the existing notations_comma_ just that the descriptions using the extension are more concise. 2 GRAPH SPECIFICATION We start by defining a language GSL graph specification language for describing graphs_comma_ and by specifying the conditions under which two graphs unify. 1 . Much recent work on specifying grammars for fragments of natural languages_comma_ and on producing computational systems which make use of these grammars_comma_ has used partial descriptions of complex feature structures Gazdar 1988 . Grammars are specified in terms of partial descriptions of syntactic structures programs that depend on these grammars perform some variant of unification in order to investigate the relationship between specific strings of words and the syntactic structures permitted by the grammarmis some sentence grammatical_comma_ what actually is its syntactic structure_comma_ how can some partially specified structure be realised as a string of words_comma_ and so on. Nearly all existing unification grammars of this kind use either term unification the kind of unification used in resolution theorem provers_comma_ and hence provided as a primitive in PROLOG or some version of the graph unification proposed by Kay 1985 and Shieber 1984 . We propose an extension to the languages used by Kay and Shieber for describing graphs_comma_ and to the specification of the conditions under which graphs unify.
E89-1029.txt,2,This extension enables us to write concise descriptions of syntactic phenomena which would be awkward to specify using the originM notations.
E89-1029.txt,3,We do not 2.1 GSL syntax The syntax of GSL has been kept as close as possible to that of FUG Kay 1985 in order to facilitate comparisons.
E89-1029.txt,4,It is not_comma_ unfortunately_comma_ possible to keep it close to both FUG and PATR Shieber 1984 _comma_ but it should be possible for readers familiar with PATR to see roughly what the relation between the two is.
E89-1029.txt,5,A node descriptor consists of either an atomic symbol_comma_ e.g. agr_comma_ cat_comma_ bar_comma_ or of two atomic symbols separated by a slash_comma_ e.g.
E89-1029.txt,6,cat C_comma_ head OBJECT.
E89-1029.txt,7,In the first case the symbol is the value of the described node_comma_ in the second the symbol before the slash is the node s value and the symbol after it is its name.
E89-1029.txt,8,We will generally use lower case words for values and upper case ones for names_comma_ but the distinction between upper and lower case has no significance in GSL.
E89-1029.txt,9,A path descriptor consists of a sequence of node descriptors separated by equals signs_comma_ e.g. head major cat prep.
E89-1029.txt,10,The path described by such a descriptor consists of the sequence of described nodes.
E89-1029.txt,11,The first node in a path is called its initial node and the final node is called its terminal node.
E89-1029.txt,12,The descriptor of the terminal node in a path may be followed by an exclamation mark_comma_ 212 as in head major cat prep _comma_ in which case the node is said to be mandatory.
E89-1029.txt,13,A graph descriptor consists of a set of path descriptors separated by commas.
E89-1029.txt,14,The graph consists of the set of described paths.
E89-1029.txt,15,If two node descriptors in a graph descriptor specify the same name_comma_ they refer to the same node.
E89-1029.txt,16,A set of paths with identical initial segments may be specified by writing the initial segment just once and including the divergent tails within nested brackets_comma_ so that A B C X Y_comma_ W V U_comma_ Q R is a shorthand form for A B C X Y_comma_ A B C W V U_comma_ A B C W Q R The sub graph governed by a path is the set of all terminal sequences of paths whose initial sequence matches the given path.
E89-1029.txt,17,The last node in the given path is called the root of the sub graph governed by the path.
E89-1029.txt,18,Thus in the above example the set of paths X Y_comma_ W V U_comma_ W Q R is the sub graph governed by the path A B C_comma_ and C is the root of this sub graph.
E89-1029.txt,19,A macro is simply a symbol which has been specified as a shorthand for some other sequence of symbols.
E89-1029.txt,20,Macros are expanded by simple textual substitution_comma_ so that if NP were a macro for the sequence of symbols cat n_comma_ bar two then head NP expands to head cat n _comma_ bar two .
E89-1029.txt,21,The parentheses are important head NP expands to head cat a _comma_ bar two _comma_ which is very different from head cat n _comma_ bar two .
E89-1029.txt,22,The major differences between GSL and the languages used by Kay and Shieber axe that GSL distinguishes between optional and mandatory nodes_comma_ and that names which function as the constraints for turning trees into graphs can be attached to non terminal nodes.
E89-1029.txt,23,GSL also differs from FUG in that it does not provide a facility for disjunctive graphs disjunction is catered for by requiring the grammar and lexicon to contain explicit alternatives_comma_ rather than by permitting graphs themselves to contain options.
E89-1029.txt,26,The fact that the second set of paths axe only roughly equivalent is a consequence of the new definition of unification given in the next section.
E89-1029.txt,27,2.2 CSL unification The major operation that we are going to perform on graphs specified in GSL is unification.
E89-1029.txt,28,We define this_comma_ as usual_comma_ in terms of the common extension of sets of graphs.
E89-1029.txt,29,We start by defining the common extension of a pair of graphs.
E89-1029.txt,30,Two graphs G1 and G2 unify to produce a common eztettsion E under the following conditions i Suppose V is the value of initial nodes in each of G1 and G2.
E89-1029.txt,31,Then the sub graphs of G1 and G2 which axe governed by the path consisting of just the node V must have a common extension_comma_ say Ev.
E89-1029.txt,32,If they do have such a common extension_comma_ then the common extension E of G1 and G2 themselves must include all the paths obtained by adding V to the front of members of Ev.
E89-1029.txt,33,If they do not then G1 and G2 do not unify_comma_ and hence have no common extension.
E89-1029.txt,34,Furthermore_comma_ if any initial node in either graph with V as its value has a name_comma_ that name must be associated with a sub graph which has a common extension with each of G1 and G2.
E89-1029.txt,35,All the paths which appear in any of these extensions must also be included in E.
E89-1029.txt,36,Again if the sub graph associated with any such name fails to have a common extension with either G1 or G2 then G1 and G2 themselves do not unify.
E89-1029.txt,37,ii Suppose V appears as the value of one or more initial nodes in G1 but of none in G2.
E89-1029.txt,38,Then if V is a mandatory terminal node of any path in G1 of which it is the initial node then G1 and G2 do not have a common extension since V is mandatory in G1_comma_ but does not appear as an initial node of any path in G2 .
E89-1029.txt,39,Otherwise the common extension of G1 and G2_comma_ if it exists_comma_ must include all the paths in G1 for which V is an initial node.
E89-1029.txt,40,The same condition applies if V is the value of one or more initial nodes in G2 but of none in G1.
E89-1029.txt,41,iii The common extension of G1 and G2 contains no paths not explicitly required by conditions i and ii . The common extension of a set of graphs G1_comma_ G2_comma_ ..._comma_ Gn where n 2 is simply the common extension of G 1 with the common extension of the set G2_comma_ ..._comma_ Gn . This definition of the common extension of 213 a set of graphs is rather non constructive_comma_ and is neutral with respect to compatational mechanisms. We need to show that we can in fact compute common extensions_comma_ and to consider the complexity of the algorithm for doing so_comma_ but before that we ought to try to show that we can use GSL to give concise descriptions of syntactic rules. If we can t do that_comma_ there is no point in worrying about the efficiency of algorithms for comparing graphs described in GSL at all. 3 SYNTACTIC DESCRIPTIONS USING GSL We will illustrate the use of GSL with elements of a categorial grammar for a fragment of English. GSL is not specifically designed for categorim grammar_comma_ but the complexity of the category structures of any non trivial categorial grammar means that such grammars provide a good testbed for notations for describing categories. Although categorial grammars have recently received considerable attention Pareschi Steedman 1987 _comma_ Klein van Benthem 1987 _comma_ Oehrle_comma_ Bach Wheeler 1987 _comma_ computational treatments have been hindered by the need to develop and manipulate large category descriptions.
E89-1029.txt,42,The expressive power of GSL is therefore well illustrated by the ease with which we can develop the category descriptions required for a non trivial categorial grammar.
E89-1029.txt,43,We start with the basic categorial rules major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH HEAD major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ RSLASH major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SUB1_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ slash null _comma_ major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SUB1_comma_ slash SLASH major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SVB1_comma_ slash nullI HEAD major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ LSLASH major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SUB1_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ slash SLASH The first of these is an extended version of the normal categorial rule for combining something which requires an argument to its right with an argument of the appropriate type_comma_ namely A A B B We have been forced to complicate this rule_comma_ as have others trying to produce categorial grammars for non trivial fragments_comma_ in order to take into account intrinsic syntactic functions such as case and number agreement_comma_ and to deal with the fine details of sub categorisation rules.
E89-1029.txt,44,In our extended version of the basic rule_comma_ the A of the basic version is replaced by major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH and the B of the basic version by major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SUB1_comma_ slash SLASH .
E89-1029.txt,45,The major features of a category are simply its main category noun_comma_ verb_comma_ preposition_comma_ conj and its bar level zero_comma_ one_comma_ two .
E89-1029.txt,46,The minor features are the intrinsic syntactic features such as agr and auz. subcat specifies what arguments lslash and rslash are required and what the head head of the local tree described by the rule is like. slash_comma_ as usual in unification grammars_comma_ carries information about unbounded dependencies.
E89-1029.txt,47,The category A B of the basic rule is replaced by HEAD major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_subcat SUB_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ RSLASH major X1_comma_ minor Y1_comma_ subcat SUBl_comma_ slash SLASH _comma_ slash null This describes a structure which will join with a major X_comma_ minor Y_comma_ subcat SUB_comma_ dash SLASH to its right to make a major Xl_comma_ minor Yl_comma_ sub cat SUBl_comma_ slash SLASH .
E89-1029.txt,48,We have made very little use of the extra facilities provided by GSL in specifying this rule_comma_ beyond the convenience of the abbreviations HEAD for subcat head and RSLASH for subcat rslaah.
E89-1029.txt,49,Apart from that_comma_ we have used names for specifying constraints_comma_ but that could easily have been done in any of the standard formalisms and we have used the exclamation mark to constrain the value of slash on the first element of the right hand side to be null.
E89-1029.txt,50,The second of the basic rules is sufficiently similar that it requires no further discussion.
E89-1029.txt,51,To show how the extra power of GSL can help us construct concise descriptions_comma_ we will consider two specific examples.
E89-1029.txt,52,The first is the definition 214 of the lexical entry for an auxiliary.
E89-1029.txt,53,This requires the_comma_ fr_comma_ll_comma__comma_wing three macro definitions VP  V_comma_ I_comma_ minor X vform agr AGR_comma_ RSLASH nulI1_comma_ HEAD S_comma_ minor X _comma_ LSLASH minor agr AGR VERB  V_comma_ O_comma_ minor X_comma_ LSLASH null _comma_ HEAD VP_comma_ minor X AUX VERB_comma_ minor anx yes _comma_ RSLASH VP_comma_ LSLASH SUBJ _comma_ HEAD LSLASH SUBJ The definition of A UX says that it is a special type of VERB_comma_ namely one that will combine with a VP to its right.
E89-1029.txt,54,The head of the A UX inherits any constraints on the subject of its own rslash.
E89-1029.txt,55,The definition of VERB says that it is something which does not require anything to its left_comma_ and that it will participate in local trees dominated by objects of type VP_comma_ with the constraint that the VERB has the same minor features as the VP.
E89-1029.txt,56,The definition of VP is fairly similar_comma_ but it does make use of the facility for placing names in nonterminal positions to enforce two constraints one between the entire set of minor features of the VP and the minor features of its head_comma_ and another between the agr features of the VP and the agr features of its subject.
E89-1029.txt,57,Although this set of abbreviations appears only to call upon the facility for including names for non terminal nodes once_comma_ we can see that if we were to expand the macros inside the definition of A UX there would be two other places where this was done the definition below still has some macros unexpanded to help keep it readable AUX  V_comma_ O_comma_ minor X aux yesT_comma_ LSLASH null _comma_ H V_comma_ I_comma_ minor X vform agr AGR_comma_ RSLASH nuU _comma_ H S_comma_minor X _comma_ LSLASH SUB J minor agr AGR _comma_ RSLASH VP_comma_ LSLASH SUBJ It is worth noting that nowhere in either the expanded definition or in the three abbreviations is the major category of the subject specified.
E89-1029.txt,58,This information may be inherited from the main verb of the VP argument of the auxiliary_comma_ but otherwise its major category is unconstrained_comma_ in order to permit sentences like Eating people i8 going out of fa.qhion and For me to eat you u_comma_ oulJ be the h icht of impropriety.
E89-1014.txt,1,this paper we present a logical treatment of semifree word order and bounded discontinuous constituency. We extend standard feature value logics to treat word order in a single formalism with a rigorous semantics without phrase structure rules.
E89-1014.txt,2,The elimination of phrase structure rules allows a natural generalisation of the approach to nonconfigurational word order and bounded discontinuous continuency via sequence union.
E89-1014.txt,3,Sequence union formalises the notions of clause union and scrambling by providing a mechanism for describing word order domains larger than the local tree.
E89-1014.txt,4,The formalism incorporates the distinction between bounded and unbounded forms of discontinuous constituency.
E89-1014.txt,5,Grammars are organised as algebraic theories.
E89-1014.txt,6,This means that linguistic generalisations are stated as axioms about the structure of signs.
E89-1014.txt,7,This permits a natural interpretation of implicational universals in terms of theories_comma_ subtheories and implicational axioms.
E89-1014.txt,8,The accompanying linguistic analysis is eclectic_comma_ borrowing insights from many current linguistic theories.
E89-1014.txt,10,In this paper we present a logical treatment of semifree word order and bounded discontinuous constituency.
E89-1014.txt,11,By a logical treatment_comma_ we mean that the grammar is an axiomatic algebraic theory_comma_ i.e._comma_ a set of axioms formalised in a logic.
E89-1014.txt,12,By bounded discontinuous constituency_comma_ we refer to phenomena such as Dutch cross serial dependencies_comma_ German Mittelfeld word order and clause bounded extraposition in contrast to unbounded forms of discontinuous constituency such as cross serial multiple extractions in Swedish relative clauses.
E89-1014.txt,13,There is no scope within this paper to provide the linguistic argumentation sufficient to justify the approach described below.
E89-1014.txt,14,We shall have to limit ourselves to describing the key linguistic insight that we wish to formalise.
E89-1014.txt,15,That is that semi free word order and nonconfigurationality are local phenomenon i.e._comma_ bounded and that word order domains are larger than the local trees of contextfree based accounts of syntax.
E89-1014.txt,16,This includes nearly all well known unification based grammar formalisms such as GPSG_comma_ IF G_comma_ I IPSG and CUG. This is simply a restatement of the notion of clause union or scrambling familiar from transformational analyses.
E89-1014.txt,17,Our proposal is to provide a feature value logic with a rigorous semantics with sufficient expressive power to allow the encoding of even syntactic structure within the single formalism.
E89-1014.txt,18,This means that the work of encoding syntactic structure is carried by the feature value logic and not by formal language theoretic devices i.e._comma_ phrase structure rules .
E89-1014.txt,19,Sequences of linguistic categories_comma_ or signs following Saussure_comma_ HI G and UCG _comma_ do the work of PSRs in our logic.
E89-1014.txt,20,The phon attribute of signs is functionally dependent on the phon attributes of the signs in sequences encoding local order domains.
E89-1014.txt,21,This allows us to trivially introduce word order domains larger than the local tree by introducing a sequence union operation.
E89-1014.txt,22,GPSG style linear precedence LP statements express partial ordering constraints on elements of sequences.
E89-1014.txt,23,The grammars we use consist of three types of elements 1 descriptions of lexical signs_comma_ 2 descriptions of nonlexical signs and 3 axioms which specify the redundant structure of signs.
E89-1014.txt,24,This organisation is similar to that of HPSG Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1987 from which we borrow many ideas.
E89-1014.txt,25,Subcategorisation is expressed in terms of sets of arguments.
E89-1014.txt,26,This borrows ideas from all of HPSG_comma_ LFG Bresnan_comma_ 1982 and categorial grammar CC .
E89-1014.txt,27,However_comma_ like HPSG and unlike LFG_comma_ our set descriptions are collapsible.
E89-1014.txt,28,We also share with CG the notions that linguistic structure is based on functor argument structure and that lexical functors partially order their arguments.
E89-1014.txt,29,All word order facts are captured in the way that lexical functors combine the ordering domains dtrs sequences of their arguments.
E89-1014.txt,30,Functors can combine order domains in one of two ways.
E89-1014.txt,31,They can take the sequence union of two sequences or concatenate one with the other.
E89-1014.txt,32,Discontinuity is achieved via sequence union.
E89-1014.txt,33,Continuity is achieved via concatenation.
E89-1014.txt,34,Since functors partially order sequences by LP statements_comma_ order amongst both continuous and discontinuous constituents is treated in the same way.
E89-1014.txt,35,This solves the problem often noted in the past of specifying the appropriate .  103constituents as sisters so that LP statements can apply correctly while satisfying the subcategorisation requirements of lexical heads and coindexing constituents correctly with subcategorised arguments.
E89-1014.txt,36,Furthermore_comma_ order is inherited from the bottom since sequence union preserves the relative order of the elements of its operands.
E89-1014.txt,37,The empirically falsifiable linguistic hypothesis made is that the whole range of local word order phenomena is treatable in this way.
E89-1014.txt,38,In 2 we present the syntax and semantics of the feature value logic In 3 we develop a methodology for organising grammars as algebraic theories.
E89-1014.txt,39,In 4 we present a toy analysis of Dutch subordinate clauses which illustrates the basic ideas underlying this paper.
E89-1014.txt,40,We very briefly discuss an interpretation of parametric variation in terms of theories and subtheories in 5 and possible implementation strategies for the logic in 6.
E89-1014.txt,42,The Syntax and Semantics of the FeatureValue Logic This logic is a quantifier free first order language with both set and sequence descriptions.
E89-1014.txt,43,Intuitively_comma_ the underlying set theory is zF FA SXT A A where SXT is the axiom of extensionality_comma_ FA is the foundation axiom and AFA is Aczd s anti foundation axiom .
E89-1014.txt,44,To cast this in more familiar terminology_comma_ two type identical elements of the domain need not be token identical.
E89-1014.txt,45,Token identity is indicated in the language via conjoining of the same variable to two or more descriptions.
E89-1014.txt,46,This is a generalisation of the notions of type identity and token identity familiar from conventional feature value logic semantics to set theory in general.
E89-1014.txt,47,Furthermore_comma_ we allow nonwellfounded structures.
E89-1014.txt,48,That is_comma_ nothing in the definition of the semantics prevents circular structures_comma_ i.e._comma_ structures which contain themselves.
E89-1014.txt,49,Otherwise_comma_ the set theory has the properties of classical set theory.
E89-1014.txt,50,However_comma_ in this paper_comma_ we will reconstruct the properties of the set theory we intend within standard set theory while observing that there is no difficulty in extending this treatment to either extensional or intensional nonwellfounded set theory.
E89-1014.txt,52,The Domain of Interpretation Every element_comma_ U i_comma_ of the universe or domain of interpretation_comma_ is a pair _comma_ where i e N is the index and U is a structure which is one of the basic types.
E89-1014.txt,53,There are four basic types.
E89-1014.txt,54,They are constants_comma_ feature structures_comma_ sets and sequences.
E89-1014.txt,55,We will call a pair _comma_u an i constant_comma_ i feature structure_comma_ i set or isequence according to the type of .
E89-1014.txt,56,The i is an abbreviation for intensional.
E89-1014.txt,57,So_comma_ an i set is an intensional set.
E89-1014.txt,58,Although we will carefully distinguish between i types and basic types in this section_comma_ we may occasionally refer to basic types in what follows when we really mean i types.
E89-1014.txt,59,We will use the following notational conventions.
E89-1014.txt,60,Script capitals denote the class of objects of basic types. superscripted script capitals denote the class of objects of the corresponding i types.
E89-1014.txt,61,Bold script capitals denote elements of the types.
E89-1014.txt,62,Bold script capitals with superscript i denote elements of the i types with index i.
E89-1014.txt,63,Capital Greek letters denote the class of descriptions of the i types and lowercase Greek letters denote descriptions of dements of the i types.

E89-1014.txt,65,We will also use superscripted bold script capitals to denote elements of an i type when we don t need to mention the index.

We Will follow these conventions below in the presentation of the syntax and semantics of the language. 2.2.

E89-1014.txt,68,I.e._comma_ they follow the Prolog convention. Lowercase Greek letters are metavariables over descriptions of structures of the corresponding intensional type.
E89-1014.txt,69,E.g._comma_ ct eA is an i constant description_comma_ e 4 is an ifeature structure description_comma_ t e K is an i set description and q Z is an i sequence description.
E89-1014.txt,70,v e N may denote a structure of any i type. 2.2.2.
E89-1014.txt,72,Set descriptions V l_comma_ .... v n are multisets of formulas.
E89-1014.txt,73,Set descriptions describe i sets of istructures.
E89-1014.txt,74,A set union description 0 1 u I 2 describes the union of two i sets.
E89-1014.txt,75,The union of two isets is an i set whose second component is the union of the second components of the two operand i sets.
E89-1014.txt,76,Note that this definition means that the indices of the two subsets do not contribute to the union. A sequence concatenation description Ol o2 describes the concatenation of two i sequences.
E89-1014.txt,77,Sometimes in grammars_comma_ we will be sloppy and write subformulas which denote arbitrary i types. This should be understood as a shorthand for subformulas surrounded by sequence brackets .
E89-1014.txt,78,V 1 ..... v n describes an i sequence of elements the order of which is unspecified.
E89-1014.txt,79,V 1 V 2 describes an implicitly universally quantified ordering constraint over a sequence.
E89-1014.txt,80,The intuitive interpretation is V 1 V 2 is satisfied by a sequence if every element of the sequence that satisfies v 1 precedes or is equal to every element of the sequence that satisfies V 2 .
E89-1014.txt,81,This is essentially the same interpretation as that given to GPSG LP constraints as modified for sequences .
E89-1014.txt,83,Matrix notation and other abbreviatory conventions We will use a variant of the familiar matrix notation below adapted to the extra expressive power that our logic provides.
E89-1014.txt,84,We will briefly outline here the translation from the matrix notation to the logic.
E89-1014.txt,86,The connectives _comma_ v_comma_ _comma_  are used in the normal way except that their arguments may be conjunctions written in matrix notation.
E89-1014.txt,87,For set sequence descriptions_comma_ big set sequence brackets are used where the elements of the set sequence may be in matrix notation.
E89-1014.txt,88,We will also often use boxed integers in the matrix notation to indicate identity instead of variables.
E89-1014.txt,89,The interpretation should be obvious.
E89-1014.txt,90,We will also use a few abbreviatory syntactic conventions.
E89-1014.txt,91,They should be obvious and will be introduced as needed.
E89-1014.txt,92,For example_comma_ the following formulas are formally equivalent V 1 V 2 V 3 V 1 v 2 V 2 V 3 In addition_comma_ we will occasionally write partial ordering statements in which the first second description in the ordering statement is a variable which denotes a sequence.
E89-1014.txt,93,In this case_comma_ the intent is that the elements of the denoted sequence all follow precede the elements satisfying the other description.
E89-1014.txt,94,For example_comma_ if VP denotes a sequence of feature structures then the description cat verb VP stands for cat verb Initial  NonVP u VP A Initial Tail and all of the dements of the VP sequence must follow any verb.
E89-1014.txt,95,Similarly_comma_ VP cat verb stands for Final cat verb  NonVP u VP Front Final  and all of the elements of the VP sequence must precede any verb 2.3.

E89-1014.txt,113,The dtrs phon axiom 106 phon Phon dtrs phon Xl ..... phon Xn  phon Xl ... Xn This axiom states that the value of the phon feature is the concatenation of the phon features of the elements of the dtrs sequence in the same order as they occur in the dtrs sequence.

E89-1014.txt,125,We require the following lexical entries.

E89-1039.txt,1,present the results from a series of experiments aimed at uncovering the discourse structure of man machine communication in natural language Wizard of Oz experiments . The results suggest the existence of different classes of dialogue situations_comma_ requiring computational discourse representations of various complexity.
E89-1039.txt,2,Important factors seem to be the number of different permissible tasks in the system and to what extent the system takes initiative in the dialogue.
E89-1039.txt,3,We also analyse indexical expressions and especially the use of pronouns_comma_ and suggest a psychological explanation of their restricted occurrence in these types of dialogues. .
E89-1039.txt,4,Natural Language interfaces will in the foreseeable future only be able to handle a subset of natural language.
E89-1039.txt,5,The usability of this type of interfaces is therefore dependent on finding subsets of natural language that can be used without the user experiencing inexplicable holes in the system performance_comma_ i.e. finding subsets for which we can computationally handle complete linguistic and conceptual coverage.
E89-1039.txt,6,This points to the need for theories of the sublanguage or sublanguages used when communicating with computers Kittredge and Lehrberger_comma_ 1982 .
E89-1039.txt,7,But unfortunately we have no well developed linguistics of natural language man machine communication. von Hahn_comma_ 1986 p. 523 One way of tackling this problem is to simulate the man machine dialogue by letting users communicate with a background system through an interface which they have been told is a natural language interface_comma_ but which in reality is a person simulating such a device sometimes called a Wizard of Oz experiment_comma_ see Guindon_comma_ Shuldberg_comma_ and Conner_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1039.txt,8,While not being a new technique_comma_ early examples are Malhotra 1975_comma_ 1977 _comma_ Thomas 1976 _comma_ and Tennant 1979_comma_ 1981 _comma_ only a limited number of studies have been conducted so far.
E89-1039.txt,9,A considerably larger number of similar studies have been conducted where the users knew that they were communicating with a person.
E89-1039.txt,10,This is unfortunate_comma_ since those researchers who have considered the issue have noted that the language used when communicating with a real or simulated natural language interface has differed from the language used in teletyped dialogues between humans_comma_ although it has been difficult to the exact nature of these differences.
E89-1039.txt,11,The language used has been described as formal Grosz_comma_ 1977 _comma_ telegraphic Guindon et al_comma_ 1987 _comma_ or computerese Reilly_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1039.txt,12,Only a few Wizard of Oz studies have been run_comma_ using different background systems and diffeting in questions asked and methods of analysis used.
E89-1039.txt,13,It is therefore premature to draw any farreaching conclusions.
E89-1039.txt,14,With some caution_comma_ bowever_comma_ perhaps the following can be accepted as a summary of the pattem of results obtained so far The syntactic structure is not too complex Guindon et al_comma_ 1987_comma_ Reilly_comma_ 1987 _comma_ and presumably within the capacity of current parsing technology.
E89-1039.txt,15,Only a limited vocabulary is used Richards and Underwood_comma_ 1984 _comma_ and even with a generous number of synonyms in the lexicon_comma_ the size of the lexicon will not be a major stumbling block in the development of an interface Good_comma_ Whiteside_comma_ Wixon_comma_ and Jones_comma_ 1984 .
E89-1039.txt,16,However_comma_ it is unclear how much of this vocabulary is common across different domains and different tasks_comma_ and the possibility of porting such a module from one system to another is an open question.
E89-1039.txt,17,Spelling correction is an important feature of any natural language based system.
E89-1039.txt,18,Socalled ill formed input fragmentary sentences_comma_ ellipsis etc is very frequent_comma_ but the use of pronouns seems limited Guindon_comma_ et al_comma_ 1987_comma_ J0nsson and Dahlb ck_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1039.txt,19,_comma_However_comma_ the results concerning ill formedness are difficult to evaluate_comma_ mainly because they are often presented without an explicit description of the linguistic representation used.
E89-1039.txt,20,An utterance can obviously only be ill formed relative to a formal specification of well formedness.
E89-1039.txt,21,With some hesitation the exclusion of such a specification can perhaps be accepted as far as syntax is 291 concemed.
E89-1039.txt,22,Both linguistic theory and our linguistic intuitions are adequately developed to guarantee some consensus on what counts as ungrammatical though the written language bias in linguistics Linell_comma_ 1982 _comma_ i.e. the tendency to regard the written language as the norm_comma_ and to view other forms as deviations from this_comma_ has in our opinion lead to an overestimation of the illformedness of the input to natural language interfaces also in this area .
E89-1039.txt,23,But when it comes to dialogue aspects of language use_comma_ we lack both theory and intuitions.
E89-1039.txt,24,What can be said without hesitation_comma_ however_comma_ is that the use of a connected dialogue_comma_ where the previous utterances set the context for the interpretation of the current one_comma_ is very common.
E89-1039.txt,25,It is therefore necessary to supplement previous and on going linguistic and computational research on discourse representations with empirical studies of different man computer dialogue situations where natural language seems to be a useful interaction technique.
E89-1039.txt,26,Not doing so would be as sensible as developing syntactic parsers without knowing anything about the language they should parse.
E89-1039.txt,27,Other researchers have proposed the use of field evaluations as they are more realistic.
E89-1039.txt,28,However_comma_ doing so requires a natural language interface advanced enough to handle the users language otherwise the evaluation will only test the NLI s already known limitations_comma_ as shown by Jarke_comma_ Turner_comma_ Stohr_comma_ Vassilou Michielsen 1985 .
E89-1039.txt,29,METHOD We have conducted a series of Wizard of Oz experiments.
E89-1039.txt,30,There are two important aspects to consider when developing the experimental situation.
E89-1039.txt,31,The first concerns the background system.
E89-1039.txt,32,It should in our opinion be something that could run on a computer using the technology of today or at least tomorrow m to ensure that the influence of the situation does not invalidate the use of data and results when developing a natural language interface.
E89-1039.txt,33,Great care should also be given to the design of the scenario_comma_ i.e. the task given to the subjects.
E89-1039.txt,34,Obviously_comma_ any simple task which only requires a few interactions between user and system will not give us much data to analyze.
E89-1039.txt,35,Our experience shows that one should either give the subjects a task for which there does not exist a single correct answer_comma_ but where the subjects own p.
E89-1009.txt,1,is a declarative language for representing a restricted class of inheritance networks_comma_ permitting both multiple and default inheritance. The principal intended area of application is the representation of lexical entries for natural language processing_comma_ and we use examples from this domain throughout.
E89-1009.txt,2,In this paper we present the syntax and inference mechanisms for the language.
E89-1009.txt,3,The goal of the DATR enterprise is the design of a simple language that i has the necessary expressive power to encode the lexical entries presupposed by contemporary work in the unification grammar tradition_comma_ ii can express all the evident generalizations about such entries_comma_ iii has an explicit theory of inference_comma_ iv is computationally tractable_comma_ and v has an explicit declarative semantics.
E89-1009.txt,4,The present paper is primarily concerned with iii _comma_ though the examples used may hint at our strategy in respect of i and ii .
E89-1009.txt,6,Inheritance networks semantic nets provide an intuitively appealing way of thinking about the representation of various kinds of knowledge.
E89-1009.txt,7,This fact has not gone unnoticed by a number of researchers working on lexical knowledge representation_comma_ e.g. de Smedt 1984 _comma_ Flickinger et al. 1985 _comma_ Calder te Linden 1987 _comma_ Daelemans 1987a_comma_1987b _comma_ Gazdar 1987 and Calder 1989 .
E89-1009.txt,8,However_comma_ many such networks have been realized in the context of programming systems or programming languages that leave their precise meaning unclear.
E89-1009.txt,9,In the light of Brachman 1985 _comma_ Etherington 1988 and much other recent work_comma_ it has become apparent that the formal properties of notations intended to represent inheritance are highly problematic.
E89-1009.txt,10,Although not discussed here_comma_ DATR has a formal semantics Evans Gazdar 1989 for which some completeness and soundness results have been derived.
E89-1009.txt,11,These results_comma_ and others on complexity_comma_ for example will be provided in a subsequent paper.
E89-1009.txt,12,There ate several prototype computational implementations of the language_comma_ and non trivial lexicon fragments for English_comma_ German and Latin have been developed and tested.
E89-1009.txt,13,2 Syntax The syntax of DATR_comma_ especially the use of valueterminated attribute trees to encode information_comma_ derives from OATR Shieber 1986 .
E89-1009.txt,14,The language consists of strings of symbols drawn from the set SYM  _comma_ _comma_._comma_ _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ and the sets ATOM and NODE_comma_ all of which are disjoint.
E89-1009.txt,16,Both kinds have on their left hand side a node path specification_comma_ where a path is a sequence of atoms enclosed in ... .
E89-1009.txt,17,Pragmatically_comma_ the  sentences are intended for defining the network_comma_ whilst the  statements express the values at individual nodes.
E89-1009.txt,18,Put another way_comma_ the former provide the database definition language whilst the latter provide the query language the useful premises will standardly all be  statements_comma_ whilst the interesting theorems will standardly all be  statements though the language itself also allows the former to be derived as theorems and the latter to be used as premises .
E89-1009.txt,19,In view of this distinction_comma_ we shall sometimes refer to  sentences as definitional and  sentences as extensional.
E89-1009.txt,20,Throughout the exampies in this paper_comma_ we shall use bold for nodes and roman for atoms.
E89-1009.txt,21,Bold italic and italic will be used for corresponding meta notational variables.
E89-1009.txt,22,Variables such as N_comma_ P_comma_ L_comma_ G and V will be assumed to be typed as nodes_comma_ paths_comma_ lvalues_comma_ gvalues and values respectively .
E89-1009.txt,23,We shall sometimes refer to atoms occurring in paths as attributes.
E89-1009.txt,24,The right hand sides of extensional sentences are values_comma_ that is_comma_ simple atoms or lists of atoms nested lists enclosed in ... .
E89-1009.txt,25,Lists are provided to allow the components of complex values to be specified independently inherited from different places_comma_ for example .
E89-1009.txt,26,As an example_comma_ the following sentences might be derivable from a lexical entry for English be Be pres tense sing one am. Be pres participle  concat be ing .
E89-1009.txt,27,Likewise_comma_ the following for German Buch Bach sing Buch.
E89-1009.txt,28,Bach plat  concat umlaut Buch er .
E89-1009.txt,29,Values are the principal results of a I ATR description the most typical operation is to determine the value associated by an extensional sentence with some node path pair.
E89-1009.txt,30,The right hand sides of definitional sentences are lvalues_comma_ which can be simple atoms_comma_ inheritance descriptors quoted or unquoted _comma_ or lists of lvalues.
E89-1009.txt,31,An atom is primitive_comma_ an inheritance descriptor specifies where the required value can be inherited from_comma_ and lists allow arbitrary structures to be built as values.
E89-1009.txt,32,Inheritance descriptors come in several forms with two dimensions of variation.
E89-1009.txt,33,The unquoted quoted distinction specifies whether the inheritance context is local the most recent context employed or global the initial context employed .
E89-1009.txt,34,Once the context is established_comma_ the descriptor specifies a new node_comma_ a new lpath_comma_ or both to be used to determine the inherited value.
E89-1009.txt,35,For example_comma_ the following sentences might be found in a description of a lexicon for English EN MOR   VERB. m EN MOR past participle  concat root en .
E89-1009.txt,36,Take   EN MOR.
E89-1009.txt,37,Take root take.
E89-1009.txt,38,Finally an lpath is a path made up of lvalues_comma_ that is_comma_ elements which themselves may need evaluation_comma_ as in this example Adjective form   gen  num  case .
E89-1009.txt,39,We adopt the following abbreviation convention for sets of sentences about a single node N P1 L1 P2 L2 Pn  Ln. abbreviates N P1 L1.
E89-1009.txt,40,N P2  L2.
E89-1009.txt,41,N Pn Ln.
E89-1009.txt,42,67 and N P1 V1 P2 V2 _comma_..
E89-1009.txt,43,Pn Vn. abbreviates N PI V1.
E89-1009.txt,44,N P2 V2. _comma_..
E89-1009.txt,45,N Pn Vn.
E89-1009.txt,46,Thus the take example given above could appear_comma_ in abbreviated form_comma_ as follows EN MOR   VERB past participle  coneat root en .
E89-1009.txt,47,Take   EN MOR. root  ake.
E89-1009.txt,48,3 Rule based inference DATR has seven syntactic rules of inference falling into three groups.
E89-1009.txt,49,The first rule just provides us with a trivial route from definitional to extensional sentences I N P V.
E89-1009.txt,50,N P V.
E89-1009.txt,51,For example_comma_ from VERB past  ed. one can infer VERB past ed.
E89-1009.txt,52,Note that V must be a value not an lvalue here_comma_ otherwise the consequent would not be wellformed.
E89-1009.txt,53,The next three rules implement local inheritance of values_comma_ and use the following additional meta notational device the expression EO E2 E1 is well formed iff EO_comma_ E1 and E2 are Ivalues and E1 occurs as a subexpression of EO.
E89-1009.txt,54,In that case_comma_ the expression denotes the result of substituting E2 for all occurrences of E1 in EO. u III IV N2 P2 G.
E89-1009.txt,55,NI P1 L.
E89-1009.txt,56,NI P1 L G N2 P2 .
E89-1009.txt,57,N2 P1 G.
E89-1009.txt,58,NI P1 L.
E89-1009.txt,59,NI P1 L G N2 .
E89-1009.txt,60,NI P2 G.
E89-1009.txt,61,NI P1 L.
E89-1009.txt,62,NI P1 L G P2 .
E89-1009.txt,63,Rule II says that if we have a theorem NI P1 L. where L contains N2 P2 as a subexpression_comma_ and we also have a theorem N2 P2 G._comma_ then we can derive a theorem in which all occurrences of N2 P2 in L are replaced by G.
E89-1009.txt,64,In the simplest case_comma_ this means that we can interpret a sentence of the form NI P1 N2 P2. as an inheritance specification meaning the value of P1 at N1 is inherited from P2 at N2 .
E89-1009.txt,65,So for example_comma_ from NOUN sing gen  s.
E89-1009.txt,66,PRON sing gen  NOUN sing gen . one can infer PRON sing gen s.
E89-1009.txt,67,Rules III and IV are similar_comma_ but specify only a new node or path not both to inherit from.
E89-1009.txt,68,The other component path or node is unchanged_comma_ that is_comma_ it is the same as the corresponding component on the left hand side of the rule specifying the inheritance.
E89-1009.txt,69,In fact_comma_ the following two sentence schemas are entirely equivalent NI P1 N2.
E89-1009.txt,70,NI P1 N2 P1. as are these two NI P1 P2.
E89-1009.txt,71,NI P1 NI P2.
E89-1009.txt,72,Rules II_comma_ III_comma_ and IV implement a local notion of inheritance in the sense that the new node or path specifications are interpreted in the current local context.
E89-1009.txt,73,The three remaining inference rules implement a non local notion of inheritance quoted descriptors specify values to be 68 interpreted in the context in which the original query was made the global context _comma_ rather than the current context.
E89-1009.txt,74,V N2 P2 V.
E89-1009.txt,75,NI P1 G.
E89-1009.txt,76,NI P1 G V N2 P2 .
E89-1009.txt,77,VI N2 P1 V.
E89-1009.txt,78,NI P1 G.
E89-1009.txt,79,N1 P1 G V N2 .
E89-1009.txt,80,VII NI P2 V.
E89-1009.txt,81,NI P1 G.
E89-1009.txt,82,NI P1 G V P2 .
E89-1009.txt,83,To see how the operation of these rules differs from the earlier unquoted cases_comma_ consider the following theory CAT sing  plur .
E89-1009.txt,84,V sing  CAT plur er.
E89-1009.txt,85,AI sing  CAT plur ern.
E89-1009.txt,86,A2 sing  en plur  A1.
E89-1009.txt,87,The intention here is that the CAT node expresses the generalisation that by default plural is the same as singular_comma_ v and A1 inherit this_comma_ but A2_comma_ while inheriting its plural form from A1_comma_ has an exceptional singular form_comma_ overriding inheritance from CAT via A1 .
E89-1009.txt,88,Now from this theory we can derive all the following theorems concerning plural V plur er.
E89-1009.txt,89,AI plur ern.
E89-1009.txt,90,A2 plur ern. and the following theorem concerning singular A2 sing en.
E89-1009.txt,91,But we cannot derive a theorem for V sing _comma_ for example.
E89-1009.txt,92,This is because v sing inherits from CAT sing _comma_ which inherits locally from CAT plur _comma_ which is not defined.
E89-1009.txt,93,What we wanted was for CAT sing to inherit from v plur _comma_ that is_comma_ from the global initial context.
E89-1009.txt,94,To achieve this we change the CAT definition to be CAT sing  plur .
E89-1009.txt,95,Now we find that we can still derive the same plural theorems_comma_ but now in addition we get all these theorems conceming singular V sing er.
E89-1009.txt,96,AI sing ern.
E89-1009.txt,97,A2 sing en.
E89-1009.txt,98,For example_comma_ the derivation for the first of these is as follows 1 V sing  CAT. given 2 CAT sing  phtr . given 3 V sing  plur .

E89-1009.txt,101,VII on 3 and 5 Finally_comma_ given a set of sentences _comma_ we define the rule closure of _comma_ rcl  to be the closure of T under finite application of the above inference rules in the conventional fashion.
E89-1009.txt,102,4 Default inference In addition to the conventional inference defined above_comma_ I AI I has a nonmonotonic notion of inference by default each definitional sentence about some node path combination implicitly determines additional sentences about all the extensions to the path at that node for which no more specific definitional sentence exists in the theory.
E89-1009.txt,103,Our overall approach follows Moore 1983_comma_ 1985 _comma_ whose treatment of inferences from sets of beliefs can be viewed more generally as a technique for providing a semantics for a declarative notion of inference by default cf. Touretzky 1986_comma_ p34 Evans 1987 .
E89-1009.txt,104,We begin with some auxiliary definitions.
E89-1009.txt,105,The expression P Q_comma_ where P and Q are paths_comma_ denotes the path formed by concatenating components of P and Q.
E89-1009.txt,106,A path P2 is an extension of a path P1 iff there is a path Q such that P2 PI Q.
E89-1009.txt,107,P2 is a strict extension iff Q is nonempty.
E89-1009.txt,108,We also use the operator to denote extension of all the paths in a DArR sentence_comma_ as in the following examples 69 S S c d S S c d S S c d N a  v.
E89-1009.txt,109,N a c d v.
E89-1009.txt,110,Nl a  N2 x y .
E89-1009.txt,111,Nl a c d  N2 x y c d .
E89-1009.txt,112,Nl a  N2  .
E89-1009.txt,113,Nl a c d  N2 c d .
E89-1009.txt,115,The root does not correspond to any syntactic category defined above it is simply a substring of the sentence.
E89-1009.txt,116,Given a set of sentences in DATR_comma_ T_comma_ a node N and a path P_comma_ we say N P is specified in Tiff T contains a definitional sentence S whose root is N P.
E89-1009.txt,117,Let NI P1_comma_ NI P2 be such that NI P1 is specified in T.
E89-1009.txt,118,We say NI P2 is connected to NI P1 relative to T iff i P2 is an extension of P1_comma_ and ii there is no strict extension P3 of P1 of which P2 is an extension such thatNl P3 is specified in T.
E89-1009.txt,119,So NI P2 is connected to NI P1 if P1 is the maximal subpath of P2 that is specified with N1 in T.
E89-1009.txt,120,Now given a set of sentences T_comma_ define the path closure pcl T of Tto be pcl T  S S is an extensional sentence in T w S Q S is a definitional sentence in T_comma_ with root N P_comma_ and N P Q is connected to N P It is clear from these definitions that any N P is connected to itself and thus that T is always a subset of pal T .
E89-1009.txt,121,The path closure contains all those theorems which can be inferred by default from T.
E89-1009.txt,122,To illustrate path closure_comma_ consider the following example theory VERB past ed past participle  en.
E89-1009.txt,123,We can infer by default the following theorems for VERB VERB past  ed past tense  ed past participle  en past tense singular  ed past participle plural en past tense singular third  ed.
E89-1009.txt,124,The situation is slightly more complicated with sentences that have paths on their right hand sides.
E89-1009.txt,125,Such paths are also extended by the subpath used to extend the left hand side.
E89-1009.txt,126,So the sentence A2 sing  Al phtr . might give rise Coy default to sentences such as A2 sing fern nom  Al plur fern nom .
E89-1009.txt,127,Using default inference_comma_ the example theory we used to illustrate global inference can be phrased more succinctly CAT sing  plur .
E89-1009.txt,128,V   CAT plur er.
E89-1009.txt,129,AI   CAT plur ern.
E89-1009.txt,130,A2 sing  en  A1.
E89-1009.txt,131,In this version_comma_ we state that anything not specifically mentioned for v is inherited Coy default from CAT_comma_ whereas before we had to list cases only sing in the example explicitly.
E89-1009.txt,132,Similarly A1 inherits by default from CAT_comma_ and A2 from A1.
E89-1009.txt,133,The operation of path closure is non monotonic if we add more sentences to our original theory_comma_ some of our derived sentences may cease to be true.
E89-1009.txt,134,The two forms of inference in DATR are combined by taking the path closure of a theory first_comma_ and then applying the inference rules to the result.
E89-1009.txt,135,In other words_comma_ given a theory T_comma_ and a sentence S_comma_ S is provable from Tiff S rcl pcl T .

E89-1008.txt,4,Finally_comma_ we discuss the questions of whether a system involving string equations allows a reduction to finite state techniques.
E89-1008.txt,6,A common assumption in linguistics is that the phonological_comma_ morphological and orthographic statements are most appropriately phrased in a fundamentally procedural way_comma_ see for example Hoeksma and Janda 1988 .
E89-1008.txt,7,Morphological analysis under the rubric of finite state morphology Koskenniemi 1983 has arguably tended to support the view that morphological alternation is best described by stating procedures for the destructive alteration of orthographic units.
E89-1008.txt,8,At the very least_comma_ it appears to have led to the view that morphological descriptions should be restricted to those with an immediate interpretation in terms of the operations of finite state transducers.

E89-1008.txt,12,We will first give a brief .
E89-1030.txt,1,way of characterising texts is in terms of the discourse structures on which they appear to be built. Each type of text_comma_ or genre_comma_ e.g. the sports report_comma_ the recipe_comma_ the sermon_comma_ the proverb_comma_ will have associated with it a characteristic organisation of units.
E89-1030.txt,2,In this paper_comma_ a general model of the structure of one text type_comma_ the story_comma_ is described.
E89-1030.txt,3,This model forms the basis of a program which combines the general story structure principles with rules goveming a particular sub genre_comma_ the Old French epic_comma_ in order to generate story summaries. .
E89-1030.txt,4,Over the last twelve years_comma_ research in Psychology and AI into narrative structure has been marked by acrimonious disputes over the right to existence of the story grammar approach.
E89-1030.txt,5,The point at issue is whether it is possible_comma_ as story grammarians suggest_comma_ to identify structural regularities particular to narrative texts Mandler and Johnson_comma_ 1980 Pemberton_comma_ 1987 Shen_comma_ 1988 _comma_ or whether any structural regularities should be interpreted rather as world knowledge_comma_ usable in contexts other than stories Gamham_comma_ 1983 Wilensky_comma_ 1980 Yazdani_comma_ 1982 .
E89-1030.txt,6,The work described in this paper adopts the story grammarian position_comma_ arguing that a general model of story structure may be used_comma_ in conjunction with_comma_ but separate from_comma_ a model of the story world _comma_ to generate stories.
E89-1030.txt,7,Moreover_comma_ a fuller version of such an account of story generation must draw not only on the general story structure model and the story world model_comma_ but also on aspects of the audience_comma_ the author_comma_ the medium of expression and the cultural context.
E89-1030.txt,8,TEXT TYPES People are able to categorise texts into types_comma_ according to the global conditions of coherence which they perceive at work in texts.
E89-1030.txt,9,Knowledge of the particular structures of each text type is an element of the cultural competence of the speaker hearer_comma_ enabling him her to process varieties of cultural artefact such as jokes_comma_ sermons_comma_ weather reports_comma_ sets of instructions and so on_comma_ in appropriate ways Ryan_comma_ 1981 .
E89-1030.txt,10,Often_comma_ especially in realistic texts_comma_ it may seem that these conditions of coherence are reducible to the everyday concepts which we use to analyse aspects of the real world_comma_ especially notions such as plans_comma_ goals and intentions.
E89-1030.txt,11,On the other hand_comma_ the fact that the same real world events_comma_ e.g. a road accident_comma_ or a bank robbery_comma_ may be represented in texts of widely different types_comma_ such as a newspaper article_comma_ a telegram message_comma_ a joke_comma_ or a conversational anecdote_comma_ indicates that structuring models_comma_ in addition to those imposed by the structure of the content_comma_ are at work in texts.
E89-1030.txt,12,Such models facilitate the 217processing of texts_comma_ creating certain expectations when we recognise a text as an instance of a particular genre_comma_ and providing a set of patterns to guide the creation of new instances.
E89-1030.txt,13,Text types interact in complex ways with the other categorial features of texts_comma_ such as content_comma_ speaker type_comma_ speech situation_comma_ register and speech act identity.
E89-1030.txt,14,Sometimes_comma_ text types are highly constrained in this regard.
E89-1030.txt,15,For example_comma_ conventionally a text of the sermon genre is uttered in the church service speech situation_comma_ in a formal register it is normally produced only by a priest figure_comma_ and often serves as a warning or exhortation speech act.
E89-1030.txt,16,Texts of the story genre are not tightly linked to any such characteristics they may be expressed by anyone_comma_ in any register_comma_ in almost any speech situation_comma_ and_comma_ while their illocutionary force is essentially assertion _comma_ their intended perlocutionary forces may be many and varied.
E89-1030.txt,17,However_comma_ sub genres such as the detective story_comma_ the narrative ballad_comma_ the traditional folk tale and so on_comma_ will impose further constraints of their own.
E89-1030.txt,18,A MODEL OF STORY GENERATION As this discussion of genre theory implies_comma_ story structure cannot be discussed in isolation from a variety of other constraints.
E89-1030.txt,19,A theory of story structure for the purposes of text generation must be situated within a broader theory of story production_comma_ which can perhaps best be described in terms of the sorts of knowledge which contribute to the creation of a story.
E89-1030.txt,20,A full story generating system would need access to many different kinds of separate but interacting knowledge.
E89-1030.txt,21,These would include knowledge of a story structure Co the audience c the author d the cultural context e the rules of the sub genre Knowledge of the audience will influence what information should be included in the text and what can be taken as read.
E89-1030.txt,22,Characteristics of the author may lead_comma_ for instance_comma_ to choices which give a particular perlocutionary force to the text a moralist might insist on a fictional wrongdoer coming to a sticky end_comma_ where a cynic might let him her go unpunished.
E89-1030.txt,23,The cultural context refers to the socio historical setting in which the text is produced_comma_ which restricts the particular sub genres available tales of saints lives_comma_ for instance_comma_ all the rage in the Twelfth Century_comma_ are now out of vogue and so virtually untellable .
E89-1030.txt,24,The rules of the sub genre will place constraints not only on the content of the text_comma_ but also on the choice of expressive medium and on stylistic choices within the expressive medium verse will be fine for a narrative ballad_comma_ inappropriate for a detective story.
E89-1030.txt,25,It is knowledge of types a and e which is encoded in the grammar of the Old French epic described below.
E89-1030.txt,26,A STORY GRAMMAR FOR THE EPIC The study reported in Pemberton_comma_ 1984 is an attempt to identify a general model of story structure_comma_ as well as the additional constraints on the form and content of a particular subgenre_comma_ the mediaeval French epic.
E89-1030.txt,27,Nine poems composed in mediaeval France_comma_ concerning the adventures of a family of French Christian fighters_comma_ were analysed and their narrative structure described in terms of a grammar.
E89-1030.txt,28,It was found necessary to distinguish between various levels of analysis of the text.
E89-1030.txt,29,The textual level is that which the reader experiences directly in the poems in question_comma_ a textual element might be Guillelmes vit Cation Guillaume saw Charles .
E89-1030.txt,30,The textual level_comma_ which is not included in the study_comma_ may be thought of as the lexicalised version of the layer of analysis referred to as discourse.
E89-1030.txt,31,This is in turn a modified version of the story line_comma_ where the story line is the succession of all the events in a story_comma_ and discourse consists of these same events restructured into a form 218 suitable for telling.
E89-1030.txt,32,The story line of a detective story_comma_ for instance_comma_ would recount the crime and its detection in chronological sequence_comma_ while the discourse ordering might begin instead with the discovery of the crime.
E89-1030.txt,33,While discourse and story line differ in structure relative to each other_comma_ they share the same elements_comma_ which consist of propositions formed of events and actors.
E89-1030.txt,34,A typical discourse storyline element might be saw Guillaume_comma_ Charles .
E89-1030.txt,35,The highest level of analysis_comma_ the narrative model_comma_ is the .
E89-1038.txt,1,this paper we describe a framework for research into translation that draws on a combination of two existing and independently constructed technologies an analysis component developed for German by the EUROTRA D ET D group of IAI and the generation component developed for English by the Penman group at ISI. We present some of the linguistic implications of the research and the promise it bears for furthering understanding of the translation process.
E89-1038.txt,3,In this paper we describe a framework for research into translation that draws on a combination of two existing and independently constructed technologies the analysis component developed for German by the EUROTRA D ET D group of IAI and the generation component developed for English by the Penman group at ISI.
E89-1038.txt,4,We have described some of the motivations for and the basic organisation of the combined framework in Steiner and Sch tz 1988 and Bateman_comma_ Kasper_comma_ Schfitz_comma_ and Steiner 1989 .
E89-1038.txt,5,Here we present in more detail some of the linguistic implications of the research and the promise it bears for furthering understanding of the translation process.
E89-1038.txt,6,Although developed separately and for quite different reasons_comma_ there is a decisive link between the two components in that ideas from a single linguistic theory_comma_ systemic functional linguistics e.g. Halliday_comma_ 1985 have been incorporated independently in both projects.
E89-1038.txt,7,A partial implementation of the grammatical stratum of organisation found in Systemic Functional Grammar SFG provides the core of Penman s linguistic capabilities Mann and Matthiessen_comma_ 1985 _comma_ whereas there is a strong input from SFG in the semantic interpretation of ET D s dependency structures Steiner_comma_ Schmidt and Zelinsky Wibbelt_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1038.txt,8,It is therefore also one of the motivations of this cooperation to investigate the potential of SFG as a tool for transfer in machine translation MT_comma_ and in the wider context of systemic functional linguistics also as a theoretical environment and as a formalism for expressing semantics.
E89-1038.txt,9,This should be of interest to a wider audience within computational linguistics_comma_ especially as SFG has recently been attracting an increasing amount of interest in the field see_comma_ e.g. Houghton and Isard_comma_ 1987 Kasper_comma_ 1988 Patten_comma_ 1988 Patten and Ritchie_comma_ 1987 Mellish_comma_ 1988 Paris and Bateman_comma_ 1989 .
E89-1038.txt,10,2 The projects involved 2.1 Eurotra D Analysis Module The German analysis module of our proposed MT system is based on the Eurotra Engineering Framework Bech and Nygaard_comma_ 1988 enhanced by a semantic component derived from systemic theory.
E89-1038.txt,11,1 The general Eurdtra philosophy for translation is described elsewhere Arnold et al._comma_ 1986_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1038.txt,12,The essentials of the Eurotra D approach are to be found in Steiner_comma_ Schmidt_comma_ and Zelinsky Wibbelt 1988 .
E89-1038.txt,13,The Eurotra system is a transfer based multi lingual MT system.
E89-1038.txt,14,It is stratificational in the sense that analysis and synthesis proceed through two syntactic levels configurational and functional and one semantic level_comma_ called the Interface Structure IS .
E89-1038.txt,15,These interface representations are semantically interpreted dependency structures they are described in more detail in Section 3.3.
E89-1038.txt,16,Each level is defined by a level specific grammar and a lexicon.
E89-1038.txt,17,The connection between adjacent levels is established with translator rules which define a treeto tree mapping between level representations.
E89-1038.txt,18,The main operation involved in the mapping is unification_comma_ i.e. the unification between already built objects and rules.
E89-1038.txt,19,Transfer between two languages takes place as a translation between the interface level representations of the source language SL and the target language TL .
E89-1038.txt,20,1Our co operation is not restricted to the Eurotra Engineering Framework formalism other versions use the CAT2 formalism Sharp_comma_ 1988 Sch tz and Sharp 1988 .
E89-1038.txt,21,282 2.2 Penman Generation Module The English generation component of our proposed MT system is Penman Mann_comma_ 1983 .
E89-1038.txt,22,Penman has been designed to be a portable_comma_ reusable text generation facility which can be embedded in many kinds of computational systems.
E89-1038.txt,23,The linguistic core of Penman is Nigel Mann and Matthiessen_comma_ 1983 _comma_ a large systemic functional grammar of English based on the work of ttalliday 1985 with contributions made by several other systemic linguists.
E89-1038.txt,24,Nigel is a large network of interdependent points of minimal grammatical contrast_comma_ called systems.
E89-1038.txt,25,Each of these systems defines a collection of alternatives called grammatical features.
E89-1038.txt,26,The semantic interface of the Nigel grammar is defined by a set of inquiries that control choices of grammatical features by mediating the flow of information between the grammar and external sources of information.
E89-1038.txt,27,Penman also provides structure for some of these external sources of information_comma_ including a conceptual hierarchy of relations and entities_comma_ called the upper model.
E89-1038.txt,28,The upper model is typically used to mediate between the organisation of knowledge found in an application domain and the kind of organisation that is most convenient for implementing the grammar s inquiries.
E89-1038.txt,29,We have made crucial use of the upper model in constructing our combination of the two components.
E89-1038.txt,30,In effect_comma_ the upper model can often mediate between the results of the MT analysis_comma_ expressed in ET D Interface Structures_comma_ and the input that must be specified for Penman_comma_ expressed in the Penman Sentence Plan Language SPL Kasper_comma_ 1989 .
E89-1038.txt,31,Each of these information sources_comma_ the upper model_comma_ the Penman SPL_comma_ and the ET D Interface Structures will now be described in detail.
E89-1038.txt,32,3 Components of the German English Interface 3.1 Penman s Upper Model Perhaps the crucial task for text generation is to be able to control linguistic resources so as to make the generated text conform to what is to be expressed.
E89-1038.txt,33,In Penman this is the responsibility of the grammar s inquiry semantics.
E89-1038.txt,34,Furthermore_comma_ a large subset of Penman s inquiries are taxonomic.
E89-1038.txt,35,These relate particular instances of what is to be expressed to the categories of semantic organisation that the grammar s semantics requires.
E89-1038.txt,36,These categories_comma_ and the relationships among them_comma_ constitute the upper model.
E89-1038.txt,37,The upper model serves to organize the propositional content that needs to be expressed in text in systemic functional linguistics_comma_ this range of meaning is called ideational.
E89-1038.txt,38,Many ideational.inquiries can be expressed in terms of the classifications of concepts that the upper model provides.
E89-1038.txt,39,These classifications form an inheritance hierarchy that organises concepts according to how they may be expressed in English.
E89-1038.txt,40,Thus_comma_ when an application domain for which Penman is to generate language connects its concepts to those of the upper model_comma_ a single inheritance hierarchy is formed from which the grammar s inquiries can determine information about how any particular domain concept may be expressed in English.
E89-1038.txt,41,We refer to this single inheritance hierarchy formed from the application domain model and the upper model as the combined model.
E89-1038.txt,42,Inquiries that need to determine whether an application domain model concept belongs to the class defined by some upper model concept can then rely on simple inheritance inferences.
E89-1038.txt,43,For example_comma_ this type of inference allows Penman to ascertain that a domain entity is a process_comma_ rather than an object_comma_ and so should be expressed as a verb rather than as a nominal phrase.
E89-1038.txt,44,Much finer distinctions are drawn by the actual upper model_comma_ which currently contains approximately 200 concepts.
E89-1038.txt,45,By virtue of their positions in the inheritance hierarchy_comma_ entities in the combined model also inherit roles from their ancestors.
E89-1038.txt,46,These can serve to define_comma_ for example_comma_ the types of participants that processes may have_comma_ or the types of qualities that may be ascribed to particular objects.
E89-1038.txt,47,Both inheritance of class membership and of roles find significant use in the construction and interpretation of expressions in the Penman interface notation SPL.
E89-1038.txt,48,3.2 Penman Interface Notation SPL Penman accepts demands for text to be generated in the SPL notation.
E89-1038.txt,49,SPL expressions are lists of terms describing the types of entities and the particular features of those entities to be expressed in English.
E89-1038.txt,50,The types of SPL terms are interpreted with respect to the knowledge base of general conceptual categories defined in the upper model.
E89-1038.txt,51,When the concepts of Penman s upper model are instantiated by more specific concepts from an application program s knowledge base i.e. world knowledge specific to the domain of the application _comma_ then application concepts can be used directly in the SPL expression.
E89-1038.txt,53,This latter possibility provides for the input of information from other sources of knowledge known to be necessary for controlling generation_comma_ e.g. text planning information and speaker hearer models.
E89-1038.txt,54,These types of meaning fall outside the kind of taxonomic_comma_ ideational meanings defined in the upper model and so require separate treatment.
E89-1038.txt,55,Currently we specify information of this type as direct responses to Penman s inquiries since the inquiries are not limited to ideational meanings.
E89-1038.txt,56,SPL representations as a whole are used as input spec 283 HI g associative speech act spactl assertion polarity polarityl positive speech act id speechact Speech act speaking time id speakingtime time time in relation to speaking time id speakingtime time in relation id speakingtime eventtime speakir time eventtime precede q speakingtime eventtime notprecedes event time eventtime time precede q eventtime speakingtime precedes g attribuant N2 europa name Europe g associated N3 Rueckstand identifiability q notidentifiable g scope N4 Anwend n identifiability q identifiable g affected NS Spitzentechnologie singularity q nonsingular multiplicity q multiple quantity ascription ql quantity number relativity q relative high quantity q high diminished q diminished relations ml g epithet domain N4 range AI industrie11  circumstantial theme q S9 HI contert relations 9 seit domain H1 range N6 Wiederaufbauphase singularity q singular multiplicity q unitary identifiability q identifiable nach N7 Krieg singularity q singular mult iplicity q unitary ident if iability q identifiahle  Figure 1 SPL representation used to generate Since the reconstruction phase after the war_comma_ Europe has had a trailing position in the industrial application of many high technologies.

E89-1038.txt,58,An example of an SPL specification for a sentence is shown in Figure 1.
E89-1038.txt,59,2 In this expression we can see a collection of SPL variables HI_comma_ N2_comma_ N3_comma_ N4... which have types drawn from concepts and relations of the combined model for English and German described in the next section these types include g associative_comma_ eu. tops_comma_ Rackstand and Anwenden.
E89-1038.txt,60,The semantic relations to be expressed and direct inquiry responses are prefixed with a colon e.g. speech.act_comma_ identifiability. q_comma_ and g affected those ending with q and .id denote Penman inquiries.
E89-1038.txt,61,3.3 Eurotra D Interface Representations The Eurotra D interface representations ET D IS are semantically interpreted dependency structures.
E89-1038.txt,62,They represent dependency relationships between constituents by structural embedding_comma_ and additional linguistic information in their feature structures_comma_ including semantic relations and semantic lexical features_comma_ such as time_comma_ diathesis_comma_ modality_comma_ mood_comma_ topic_comma_ focus_comma_ determination and number.
E89-1038.txt,63,An example of an IS representation is given in Figure 2.
E89-1038.txt,64,In this representation we can see at the topmost node the features s TENSE and s_ASPECT which are used to compute the appropriate time information for the SPL expression.
E89-1038.txt,65,The German simul durative present has to be expressed in English with a present perfect construction.
E89-1038.txt,66,The feature nclass proper is responsible for the fact that in the SPL expression we can simple use the keyword macro name which indicates any propernoun lexical item.
E89-1038.txt,68,The feature g.scope in the SPL representation is inserted from the IS feature d_pform in of the NP governed by Anwendung.
E89-1038.txt,69,These features axe referring to categories of an upper model that we have constructed for German UM the UMG is essentially a re expression of the transitivity relations worked out in Fawcett 1987 . Just as for the Penman upper model for English_comma_ which we shall now label UME_comma_ the German upper model is not a representation of a particular sentence it is a representation of concepts into which IS roles and roleconfigurations are mapped.
E89-1038.txt,70,The UMG concepts then 2This specification shows the finest level of detail of grammar control that may be given in an SPL expression.
E89-1038.txt,71,In practise_comma_ when using SPL it is possible to abbreviate or to default commonly used combinations of inquiry responses thus_comma_ for example_comma_ it is possible to replace all of the speech act_comma_ speech act id_comma_ and e ent time features shown in Figure 1 with the more coarsely grained_comma_ specification speech act sssrt tense present in past For more details see Kasper 1989 . also stand in inheritance relationships to each other.
E89-1038.txt,72,Furthermore_comma_ a concept in UM may have slots roles which can be filled by other concepts_comma_ of specified types role restrictions .
E89-1038.txt,73,Roles of the German IS grammar are linked to concepts of UM through the specialize predicate.
E89-1038.txt,74,When an IS is expressed in an SPL representation_comma_ the roles st features of IS are mostly substituted by the corresponding UMG concepts.
E89-1038.txt,75,Roles as well as features of IS may also be mapped into inquiry responses during transfer into SPL_comma_ as described in Section 4.3.
E89-1038.txt,76,The fact that for the time being the UMG is almost isomorphic to a representation of the predicate argument part of the German IS grammar is more due to time constraints than to any far reaching claims about the mutual relationships between an IS and an Upper Model_comma_ although the nature of that relationship is interesting and is receiving study in its own right.
E89-1038.txt,77,4 The Nature of the Translation Process It is important from a conceptual point of view to keep apart the three levels of representation involved here ET D IS_comma_ UM _comma_ and a description of the German sentence in SPL.
E89-1038.txt,78,The basic form of the translation process is to transfer ET D IS representations into Penman SPL representations.
E89-1038.txt,79,As ET D IS and Penman SPL representations are both feature based dependency structures_comma_ the formal aspects of the transfer from ET D IS into Penman SPL are not very complicated.
E89-1038.txt,80,Determining an appropriate mapping for the content of particular values within ET D IS representations is by far a more challenging aspect of this translation process.
E89-1038.txt,81,The translation process is achieved by employing three principal levels of transfer_comma_ which are described in detail below.
E89-1038.txt,82,The product of this multi level transfer is an SPL representation of the English translation of the original German sentence_comma_ which may then drive generation by Penman as in any other application domain.
E89-1038.txt,83,The translation process as a whole is summarised in Figure 3.
E89-1038.txt,84,The general strategy of this translation process should also generalise to future applications in a multi lingual MT environment.
E89-1038.txt,85,4.1 Upper model transfer Preparatory to being able to transfer IS representations into corresponding SPL expressions for German sentences_comma_ a mapping needs to be established between the categories of UMo and appropriate categories of Penman s English specific upper model UME .
E89-1038.txt,86,As an initial approximation_comma_ and one which makes maximal use of mechanisms already developed for driving Penman_comma_ we take the concepts of UMG as specialis. ing the concepts of UM .

E89-1038.txt,89,Translation of UMa categories and hence_comma_ indirectly_comma_ of the IS semantic features subsequently takes the form of inferencing over the inheritance relationships in the combined UMc UME model.
E89-1038.txt,90,This is the standard way in which the general grammatical resources of Penman are made responsive to knowledge from particular application domains.
E89-1038.txt,91,Here_comma_ the German upper model is simply being made to play the role of a Penman appllcation domain.
E89-1038.txt,92,Let us give an example of this type of transfer.
E89-1038.txt,93,In the example sentence whose IS representation was shown in Figure 2_comma_ we have the prepositional phrase Seit der Wiederaufbauphase .... Seit as a German preposition in one of its readings is linked into UMo as a concept that specializes a more general relation g spatio temporal in UMG.
E89-1038.txt,94,The UMa g spatiotemporal is further linked_comma_ by the preparatory mapping already defined between the English and German upper models_comma_ to a UME concept static spatial and this UME category guides the responses to Penman s inquiries to consider all the grammatical constructs and lexical items of English that Nigel has available for realizing this concept.
E89-1038.txt,95,In particular_comma_ one of the English realizations may be the English preposition since_comma_ which is thus one candidate for an acceptable translation.
E89-1038.txt,96,Because the prepositional phrase is a modifier of the main process indicated by the role feature and the fact that the main process and the modifier are siblings in the IS representation we have to use in SPL a relations construct to state this dependence.
E89-1038.txt,97,In SPL this is a special keyword which is used for information that does not determine a unique inquiry response without reference to other contextual information.
E89-1038.txt,98,Apart from the specific example given here_comma_ the translation through the UMa UM combination opens the way to relatively free_comma_ but still acceptable translations_comma_ and thus provides the framework for discussing the notion of an acceptable translation_comma_ as different from_comma_ say_comma_ a simple paraphrase.
E89-1038.txt,99,Note_comma_ in particulax_comma_ that syntactic category need not be preserved in this translation process_comma_ which is important for the translation of_comma_ say_comma_ relative clauses in German into NP or PP modifiers in English_comma_ translation of pre modifiers of German into post.modifiers in English etc. all of which are classical translation problems between these and other languages.
E89-1038.txt,100,At present_comma_ lexical transfer is also largely handled as a side effect of transfers of this type.
E89-1038.txt,101,4.2 Semantic feature transfer Semantic features of the ET D IS representation may also be transferred into sets of Penman inquiry responses.
E89-1038.txt,102,This type of transfer is used for semantic information of kinds not approI riate for inclusion in an upper model_comma_ e.g._comma_ textual organisation information_comma_ non hierarchical conceptual information and speech act information.
E89-1038.txt,103,Penman has a rich variety of inquiries dealing with such information and so makes available a large set of resources and capabilities for any system that requires English as output.
E89-1038.txt,104,Information of these kinds is notoriously difficult for the usual types of syntactic transfer strategies.
E89-1038.txt,105,Determiner selection_comma_ and_comma_ in particular_comma_ correct translation of the indefinite and definite articles are another case of this.
E89-1038.txt,106,For example_comma_ the IS semantic features representing determination are translated into the inquiry responses that are responsible for controlling determiner selection in Nigel as follows def yes nb sing . identifiability q identifiable multiplicity q unitary singularity q singular .
E89-1038.txt,107,Thus_comma_ the features expressing definiteness in IS are mapped into inquiry responses giving information about whether a given phrase is identifiable those features expressing number are mapped into responses concerning whether the concept is to be expressed as a single entity or as several distinct entities.
E89-1038.txt,108,These are some of the semantic dimensions around which NigeI organises the selection of determiners and quantifiers in English for a fuller account of Nigel s treatment_comma_ see Bateman and Matthiessen_comma_ 1988 also_comma_ for an account of the ET D approach_comma_ see Steiner_comma_ Winter and Zellnsky Wibbelt_comma_ 1987 .
E89-1038.txt,109,It is this level of information at which meaning is preserved in translation_comma_ and not the syntax tic level of determiner selection this is dearly shown by the fact that translation between languages with and without articles is possible.
E89-1038.txt,110,Another area which is translated in this way in the present system is the area of time.
E89-1038.txt,111,Both the Eurotra appr ch to time cf. van Eynde_comma_ 1988 and the Nigel approach cL Matthiessen_comma_ 1984 grew out of a critical appraisal of the Reichenbachian framework_comma_ although they took quite different directions from there_comma_ with Mar hiessen following essentially SFG lines.
E89-1038.txt,112,Still_comma_ enough common ground has been preserved in order to make a transfer of ET D time features i.e. semantic _comma_ rather than tense features morpho syntactic _comma_ an interesting and possible enterprise.
E89-1038.txt,113,Tenses encode complex relationships between time of speaking_comma_ reference time_comma_ and time of event_comma_ in interaction with Adverbiais in particular_comma_ and it is only with the help of a type of transfer that gives access to this level of detail that we can arrive at the English present perfect tense as a translation of the German present plus a time adverbial.
E89-1038.txt,114,For example_comma_ in Figure 1_comma_ we can see the inquiry responses under the features speakingtime id and event.time that convey this information to Nigel.
E89-1038.txt,115,These are the results of interpreting the features s.TENSE and s ASPECT in the IS representation shown in Figure 2.
E89-1038.txt,116,While we are not claiming that a direct mapping of tenses into tenses in SL TL transfer is necessarily impossible_comma_ it would seem considerably more complex and translationally implausible than encoding the meaning expressed by tenses_comma_ as we have done here in terms of inquiry responses.
E89-1038.txt,117,288 4.3 Morpho syntactic transfer It is also possible for morpho syntactic features of the ET D IS representation to be directly translated into corresponding grammatical features of the Nigel grammar e.g.
E89-1038.txt,118,ET D active passive to Nigel activeprocess passive process.
E89-1038.txt,119,This type of transfer is very close to the idea of IS IS transfer in Eurotra_comma_ but is used sparingly in the present application.
E89-1038.txt,120,Most of the morpho syntactic features present in the IS representations do not need to be used directly since the semantic features give sufficient and more appropriate information for translation.
E89-1038.txt,121,5 Perspectives for MT and Text Generation Combining the resources of the ET D German analysis component with the Penman English generator has created an interesting research environment for asking questions about transfer strategies in MT.
E89-1038.txt,122,As is well known_comma_ the transfer process in an MT environment places complex requirements on both the linguistic theories involved and on the theories of translation.
E89-1038.txt,123,Perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the endeavour has been the new perspective which one gets on old problems_comma_ which suddenly seem to lose the air of having a range of often tried and well known_comma_ but essentially unsatisfactory solutions.
E89-1038.txt,124,One whole class of questions relates to what should be preserved in a translation process_comma_ as different from_comma_ say_comma_ processes of paraphrasing or summarising.
E89-1038.txt,125,One possible answer to this is that what needs to be preserved at least is the truth value of sentences and their translations.
E89-1038.txt,126,While this may serve as a useful bottom line from which to start_comma_ it has long been recognised to be no more than that.
E89-1038.txt,127,Many researchers argue that we also need to preserve the essential features of thematic structure and information structure.
E89-1038.txt,128,For most projects at this time_comma_ this problem is difficult to address because the linguistic models embodied in them do not foreground that type of information_comma_ ttowever_comma_ with ET D s interest in topic and focus_comma_ and with Nigel s fairly comprehensive treatment of theme_comma_ there is a very immediate way of making these aspects of linguistic information an accessible part of the translation process.
E89-1038.txt,129,In the translation pair represented by Figures 1 and 2_comma_ for example_comma_ we can see that the IS s mantic feature top yes indicating thematic prominence have been transferred into the inquiry response specification circumstantial theme q S9 H1 context.
E89-1038.txt,130,This calls for the grammar to prepose the constituent realising 9_comma_ i.e. the Since clause_comma_ into sentence initial thematic position_comma_ rather than letting it appear later in the sentence as it would when non thematic.
E89-1038.txt,131,The function of predicate argument structures_comma_ especially in connection with semantic casls is another interesting research topic as suggested by Somers 1986 which can be addressed in the present context_comma_ especially as the two components involved share their essential notions of predicate argument structures from systemic linguistics.
E89-1038.txt,132,Our first translations in this research environment are still sentence based however_comma_ in the longer term we will concentrate our research interests on issues concerning text structure.
E89-1038.txt,133,The Penman group intends to enhance the Penman environment to the interpersonal and textual metafunctions of SFG.
E89-1038.txt,134,Although these extensions will be made primarily for text generation they should be of interest also for the design of a textbased MT analysis.
E89-1038.txt,135,In summary_comma_ then_comma_ we have introduced the projects involved_comma_ and the structure of the German Engllsh transfer mechanism_comma_ offering specific examples of the transfer process for some of the features present in the IS analysis.

E89-1003.txt,1,From a processing point of view_comma_ however_comma_ flexible categorial systems are problematic_comma_ since they introduce spurious ambiguity. In this paper_comma_ we present a flexible categorial grammar which makes extensive use of the product operator_comma_ first introduced by Lambek 1958 .
E89-1003.txt,2,The grammar has the property that for every reading of a sentence_comma_ a strictly left branching derivation can be given.
E89-1003.txt,3,This leads to the definition of a subset of the grammar_comma_ for which the spurious ambiguity problem does not arise and efficient processing is possible.
E89-1003.txt,5,Flexibility vs. Ambiguity Categorial Grammars owe much of their popularity to the fact that they allow for various degrees of flexibility with respect to constituent structure.
E89-1003.txt,6,From a processing point of view_comma_ however_comma_ flexible categorial systems are problematic_comma_ since they introduce spurious ambiguity.
E89-1003.txt,7,The best known example of a flexible categorial grammar is a grammar containing the reduction rules application and composition_comma_ and the category changing rule raising 1  I would like to thank Esther K0nig_comma_ Erik Jan van der Linden_comma_ Michael Moortgat_comma_ Adriaan van Paassen and the participants of the Edinburgh Categorial Grammar Weekend_comma_ who made useful comments to earlier presentations of this material.
E89-1003.txt,8,All remaining errors and misconceptions are of course my own.
E89-1003.txt,10,From a linguistic point of view_comma_ this has many advantages.
E89-1003.txt,11,Various kind of arguments for giving up traditional conceptions of constituent structure can be given_comma_ but the most convincing and well documented case in favour of flexible constituent structure is coordination see Steedman 1985 _comma_ Dowty 1988 _comma_ and Zwarts 1986 .
E89-1003.txt,12,The standard assumption in generative grammar is that coordination always takes place between between constituents.
E89-1003.txt,13,Rightnode raising constructions and other instances of non constituent conjunction are problematic_comma_ because it is not clear what the status of the coordinated elements in these constructions is.
E89-1003.txt,14,Flexible categorial grammar presents an elegant solution for such cases_comma_ since_comma_ next to canonical constituent structures_comma_ it also admits various other constituent structures.
E89-1003.txt,17,John sold and Mary bought a book s vp vp np s vp vp np np s np s np left directional functor respectively_comma_ looking for an argument of category B.
E89-1003.txt,20,In Ades Steedman 1982 it is pointed out that humans process natural language in a left to right_comma_ incremental_comma_ manner.
E89-1003.txt,21,This processing aspect is accounted for in a flexible categorial system_comma_ where constituents can be built for any part of a sentence.
E89-1003.txt,22,Since syntactic rules operate in parallel with semantic interpretation rules_comma_ building a syntactic structure for an initial part of a sentence_comma_ implies that a corresponding semantic structure can also be constructed.
E89-1003.txt,23,These and other arguments suggest that there is no such thing as a fixed constituent structure_comma_ but that the order in which elements combine with eachother is rather free.
E89-1003.txt,24,From a parsing point of view_comma_ however_comma_ flexibility appears to be a disadvantage.
E89-1003.txt,25,Flexible categorial grammars produce large numbers of_comma_ often semantically equivalent_comma_ derivations for a given phrase.
E89-1003.txt,26,This spurious ambiguity problem Wittenburg 1986 makes efficient processing of flexible categorial grammar problematic_comma_ since quite often there is an exponential growth of the number of possible derivations_comma_ relative to the length of the string to be parsed.
E89-1003.txt,27,There have been two proposals for eliminating spurious ambiguity from the grammar.
E89-1003.txt,28,The first is Wittenburg 1987 .
E89-1003.txt,29,In this paper_comma_ a categorial grammar with composition and heavily restricted versions of raising for subject n p s only is considered.
E89-1003.txt,30,Wittenburg proposes to eliminate spurious ambiguity by redefining composition.
E89-1003.txt,31,His predictive composition rules apply only in those cases where they are really needed to make a derivation possible.
E89-1003.txt,32,A disadvantage of this method_comma_ noticed by Wittenburg_comma_ is that one may have to add special predictive composition rules for all general combina 20 tory rules in the grammar.
E89-1003.txt,33,Some careful rewriting of the original grammar has to take place_comma_ before things work as desired.
E89-1003.txt,34,Pareschi Steedman 1987 propose an efficient chart parsing algorithm for categorial grammars with spurious ambiguity.
E89-1003.txt,35,Instead of the usual strategy_comma_ in which all possible subconstituents are added to the chart_comma_ Pareschi Steedman restrict themselves to adding only those constituents that may lead to a difference in semantics.
E89-1003.txt,36,Thus_comma_ in 3 only the underlined constituents are in the chart.
E89-1003.txt,37,The  constituent is not.
E89-1003.txt,39,Here_comma_ the Pareschi Steedman algorithm starts looking for a constituent left adjacent of madly_comma_ which contains an element X vp as a leftmost category.
E89-1003.txt,41,Therefore_comma_ Pareschi Steedman are able to work with only a minimal amount of items in the chart.
E89-1003.txt,42,Both Wittenburg and Pareschi Steedman work with categorial grammars_comma_ which contain restricted versions of composition and raising.
E89-1003.txt,43,Although they can be processed efficiently_comma_ there is linguistic evidence that they are not fully adequate for analysis of such phenomena as coordination.
E89-1003.txt,44,Since atomic categories can in general not be raised in these grammars_comma_ sentence 2b in which the category n p has to be raised cannot be derived.
E89-1003.txt,45,Furthermore_comma_ since composition is not generalized_comma_ as in Ades Steedman 1982 _comma_ a sentence such as John sold but Mary donated a book to the library would not be derivable.
E89-1003.txt,46,The possibilities for left to right_comma_ incremental_comma_ processing are also limited.
E89-1003.txt,47,Therefore_comma_ there is reason to look for a more flexible system_comma_ for which efficient parsing is still possible.
E89-1003.txt,49,Structural Completeness In the next section we present a grammatical calculus_comma_ which is more flexible than the systems considered by Wittenburg 1987 and Pareschi Steedman 1987 _comma_ and therefore is attractive for linguistic purposes.
E89-1003.txt,50,At the same time_comma_ it offers a solution to the spurious ambiguity problem.
E89-1003.txt,51,Spurious ambiguity causes problems for parsing in the systems mentioned above_comma_ because there is no systematic relationship between syntactic structures and semantic representations.
E89-1003.txt,52,That is_comma_ there is no way to identify in advance_comma_ for a given sentence S_comma_ a proper subset of the set of all possible syntactic structures and associated semantic representations_comma_ for which it holds that it will contain all possible semantic representations of S.
E89-1003.txt,53,5 Strong Structural Completeness If a sequence of categories XI ..
E89-1003.txt,54,X n reduces to Y_comma_ with semantics Y _comma_ there is a reduction to Y_comma_ with semantics Y _comma_ for any bracketing of XI..Xn into constituents.
E89-1003.txt,55,Grammars with this property_comma_ can potentially circumvent the spurious ambiguity problem_comma_ since for these grammars_comma_ we only have to inspect all left branching syntax trees_comma_ to find all possible readings.
E89-1003.txt,56,This method will only fail if the set of leftbranching trees itself would contain spurious ambiguous derivations.
E89-1003.txt,57,In section 4 we will show that these can be eliminated from the calculus presented below.
E89-1003.txt,59,The P calculus Consider now a grammar for which the following property holds 4 Structural Completeness If a sequence of categories X1 ..
E89-1003.txt,60,X n reduces to Y_comma_ there is a reduction to Y for any bracketing of X1..Xn into constituents.
E89-1003.txt,61,Moortgat_comma_ 1987 5 2 Structural complete grammars are interesting linguistically_comma_ since they are able to handle_comma_ for instance_comma_ all kinds of non constituent conjunction_comma_ and also because they allow for strict left to right processing see Moortgat_comma_ 1988 .
E89-1003.txt,62,The latter observation has consequences for parsing as well_comma__comma_ since_comma_ if we can parse every sentence in a strict left to right manner that is_comma_ we produce only strictly leftbranching syntax trees _comma_ the parsing algorithm can be greatly simplified.
E89-1003.txt,63,Notice_comma_ however_comma_ that such a parsing strategy is only valid_comma_ if we also guarantee that all possible readings of a sentence can be found in this way.
E89-1003.txt,64,Thus_comma_ instead of 4 _comma_ we are looking for grammars with the following_comma_ slightly stronger_comma_ property 2 Buszkowski 1988 provides a slightly different definition in terms of functor argument structures.
E89-1003.txt,65,The P roduct calculus is a categorial grammar_comma_ based on Lambek 1958 _comma_ which has the property of strong structural completeness.
E89-1003.txt,66,In Lambek 1958 _comma_ the foundations of flexible categorial grammar are formulated in the form of a calculus for syntactic categories.
E89-1003.txt,67,Well known categorial rules_comma_ such as application_comma_ composition and category raising_comma_ are theorems of this calculus.
E89-1003.txt,68,A largely neglected aspect of this calculus_comma_ is the use of the product operator.
E89-1003.txt,69,The calculus we present below_comma_ was developed as an alternative for Moortgat s 1988 M system.
E89-1003.txt,70,The M system is a subset of the Lambek calculus_comma_ which uses_comma_ next to application_comma_ only a very general form of composition.
E89-1003.txt,71,Since it has no raising_comma_ it seems to be an attractive candidate for investigating the possibilities of left associative parsing for categorial grammar.
E89-1003.txt,72,It is not completely satisfactory_comma_ however_comma_ since structural completeness is not fully guaranteed_comma_ and also_comma_ since it is unknown whether the strong structural completeness property holds for this system.
E89-1003.txt,73,In our calculus_comma_ we hope to overcome these problems_comma_ by using product . and elimination rules instead of composition.
E89-1003.txt,74,The kernel of the P calculus is rightand left application_comma_ as usual.
E89-1003.txt,75,Next to these_comma_21 we use a rule for introducing the productoperator_comma_ and two inference rules for eliminating products 6 RA A B B A LA B B _comma_ A product .
E87-1011.txt,1,argue that there are two qualitatively different modes of using a machine readable dictionary in the context of research in computational linguistics batch processing of the source with the purpose of collating information for subsequent use by a natural language application_comma_ and placing the dictionary on line in an environment which supports fast interactive access to data selected on the basis of a number of linguistic constraints. While it is the former mode of dictionary use which is characteristic of most computational linguistics work to date_comma_ it is the latter which has the potential of making maximal use of the information typically found in a machine readable dictionary.
E87-1011.txt,2,We describe the mounting of the machine readable source of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English on a single user workstation to make it available as a development tool for a number of research projects.
E87-1011.txt,4,A growing mass of work at present_comma_ both within the narrower field of computational linguistics and in the wider context of building knowledge based systems_comma_ is focussed on making use of the lexical resources to be found in a number of monolingual dictionaries of the style exemplified by e.g.
E87-1011.txt,5,The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English_comma_ The Collins English Dictionary_comma_ or Webster s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary.
E87-1011.txt,6,These contain a wealth of information relevant to a wide range of natural language processing functions a fact which is hardly surprising_comma_ given that such sources typically and almost by definition contain the results of substantial efforts to collate and analyse data about real language_comma_ to elicit collocational and distributional properties of words and to apply common principles of defining their meaning.
E87-1011.txt,7,The availability of dictionary sources on line_comma_ in the form of machine readable dictionaries henceforth MRDs and encyclopaedias_comma_ makes it possible to view these as repositories of large amounts of information_comma_ linguistic and extra linguistic_comma_ which can be brought to bear at various points of the natural language understanding process.
E87-1011.txt,8,Developments in hardware_comma_ as well as research in computational linguistics_comma_ offer the technology both to process lexical resources and to extract from them what is relevant to computer programs concerned with various natural language processing activities.
E87-1011.txt,9,A number of recent projects have extracted data from publishers tapes and subsequently used it to support activities such as syntactic parsing_comma_ speech synthesis_comma_ lexical disambiguation_comma_ semantic interpretation in context_comma_ spelling correction and machine translation.
E87-1011.txt,10,The common denominator in these projects is that the end product incorporates in some form appropriate fragments derived from the machine readable source.
E87-1011.txt,11,There are essentially two different modes in which MRDs can be used see Boguraev_comma_ 1987_comma_ for more details .
E87-1011.txt,12,The predominant technique to date involves an arbitrary amount of pro processing_comma_ typically in batch_comma_ of the on line source.
E87-1011.txt,13,Those parts of the dictionary entries which contain useful data for the task at hand are extracted and suitably represented in a form directly usable by a client program.
E87-1011.txt,14,Such a model of dictionary use does not in any way rely on the original source being available at the time the language processing application is active_comma_ and thus a batch derivation of the appropriate information is a suitable way of transforming the raw data into a usable repository of lexical knowledge.
E87-1011.txt,15,But the reality of trying to adapt information_comma_ originally packaged according to lexicographic and typographic conventions for visual presentation and not at all intended for automated natural language processing_comma_ suggests a different model of dictionary use.
E87-1011.txt,16,The non trivial task of developing suitable procedures for pre processing of the machine readable source typically requires careful analysis of the properties of the particular MILD_comma_ and is best aided by having fast interactive access to appropriate fragments of it.
E87-1011.txt,17,In addition_comma_ many research projects of a more experimental nature focus on investigating the ways in which the availability of an MRD can aid the development of particular natural language processing systems.
E87-1011.txt,18,The assumption is that an analysis of the accumulated data in the dictionary will reveal regularities which can then be exploited for the task at hand.
E87-1011.txt,19,Just one example_comma_ from a number of projects currently under way in Cambridge_comma_ illustrating this point is the work of Alshawi 1987 _comma_ who has analysed definition texts across an entire dictionary to produce a definition grammar together with an associated technique for parsing the natural language descriptions of words into semantic structures.
E87-1011.txt,20,Such projects depend critically not only on the availability of a machine readable equivalent of a published dictionary_comma_ but also on a software system capable of providing fast interactive access into the online source through various access routes.
E87-1011.txt,21,Operational natural language processing systems clearly will have well defined requirements as far as their lexicons are concerned_comma_ and once the format of lexical resources has been settled_comma_ retrieval of individual entries can be implemented fairly efficiently using standard computational and linguistic techniques see e.g. Russell et al._comma_ 1986 .
E87-1011.txt,22,The placing of a dictionary on line_comma_ however_comma_ with the intention of making it available to a number of different research projects which need to locate and 63 collate dictionary samples satisfying a wide range of constraints_comma_ requires an efficient and flexible system for management and retrieval of linguistic data.
E87-1011.txt,23,This is not the computationally straightforward issue it appears to be_comma_ as conventional database management systems DBMS are not well suited for online dictionary support_comma_ particularly when the entire dictionary is viewed as a lezical knowledge b e_comma_ more complex in structure and facing more taxing demands in a natural language research environment.
E87-1011.txt,24,This paper addresses the problem in greater detail_comma_ by placing it into the wider context of research into computational linguistics and highlighting those issues which pose a challenge for the current DBMS wisdom.
E87-1011.txt,25,We propose a solution adequate to handle most of the lexical requirements of current systems_comma_ which is generalisable to a range of IVIRDs_comma_ and describe a particular implementation for single user workstations used in a number of on going research projects at the universities of Cambridge and Lancaster.
E87-1011.txt,26,2 The nature of the problem Several factors put the task of mounting a machinereadable dictionary as a proper development tool beyond the scope of current DBMS practice and make its conversion into a database of e.g. a standard relational kind quite difficult.
E87-1011.txt,27,Firstly_comma_ there is the nature of the data in a dictionary typically_comma_ it contains far too much free text definitions_comma_ examples_comma_ cross reference pointers_comma_ glosses on usage and so forth to fit easily into the concept of structured data.
E87-1011.txt,28,On the other hand_comma_ the highly structured and formallsed encoding of other types of information found in e.g. the part of speech_comma_ syllabification or pronunciation fields makes a dictionary equally unsuitable for on line access by information retrieval methods.
E87-1011.txt,29,The second factor is due to the nature of the only source of machine readable dictionaries so far available namely the publishers typesetting tapes_comma_ originally constructed for the production of a printed version.
E87-1011.txt,30,The organisation of data there_comma_ aimed at visual presentation_comma_ carries virtually no explicit structure a tape is simply a character stream containing an arbitrary mixture of typesetting commands and real data.
E87-1011.txt,31,This not only introduces the difficult problem of parsing a dictionary entry addressed in detail by e.g. Kazman_comma_ 1986 _comma_ but also raises the issue of devising a suitable representation for the potentially huge amount of linguistic data one which does not limit in any way the language processing functions that could be supported or constrain the complexity of the computational counterpart of a dictionary entry.
E87-1011.txt,32,Finally_comma_ there is the nature of the data structures themselves.
E87-1011.txt,33,A text processing application_comma_ typically written in Lisp or Prolog_comma_ requires that its lexicai data is represented in a compatible form_comma_ say Lisp s expressions of arbitrary complexity.
E87-1011.txt,34,Therefore_comma_ even if we choose to remain neutral with respect to representation details_comma_ we still face the problem of interfacing to a vast number of symbolic s expressions_comma_ held in secondary storage.
E87-1011.txt,35,This problem arises from the unsuitability of conventional data models for handling the complex data structures underlying any sophisticated symbolic processing.
E87-1011.txt,36,Partly_comma_ this is due to the inherent restrictions such models impose on the class of data structure they can represent easily namely records of fixed format.
E87-1011.txt,37,But more importantly_comma_ conventional database systems make strong assumptions about the status and use of data they have to hold databases are taken to consist of a large number of data records taken from a small number of rigidlydefined classes.
E87-1011.txt,38,It is not clear that a lexical knowledge base _comma_ derived from a dictionary and intended to support a wide range of language processing applications_comma_ fits this model well.
E87-1011.txt,39,Some solutions to these problems will no doubt be offered by dedicated efforts to develop special purpose data models_comma_ capable of computationally representing a dictionary and amenable to flexible and effcient DBMS support.
E87-1011.txt,40,The work_comma_ at the University of Waterloo_comma_ on computerising the Ozford English Dictionary Tompa_comma_ 1986 is a good example here similarly_comma_ the desire to be able to mount computerised dictionaries on llne for in house research motivates Byrd s work on a general purpose dictionary access method Byrd etal._comma_ 1986 .
E87-1011.txt,41,In the short run_comma_ alternative approaches reduce the complexity of the problem by limiting themselves to applying the machine readable source of a dictionary to a small class of similar tasks_comma_ and building customlsed interfaces offering relatively narrow access channels into the on line data.
E87-1011.txt,42,Thus IBM s WordSmith system Byrd and Chodorow_comma_ 1985 is concerned primarily with providing a browsing functionality which supports retrieval of words close to a given word along the dimensions of spelling_comma_ meaning and sound_comma_ while a group at Bell Labs has several large dictionaries on line used only for research on stress assignment Church_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1011.txt,43,Alshawi et al. 1985 have used a machine readable source directly for syntactic analysis of texts however_comma_ the approach taken there namely that of simple pro indexing by orthography does not generalise easily for applications which require the rapid locating and retrieval of entries satisfying more than one selection criterion.
E87-1011.txt,44,3 System functionality The motivation for the design described here is divided equally between the diverse nature of MRDbased projects in Cambridge and Lancaster and the unique properties of the particular dictionary that they use.
E87-1011.txt,45,The suitability of the Longr an Dictionarv of Con temporary English LDOCE for research into computationa linguistics has been discussed at length elsewhere see_comma_ in particular_comma_ Michiels_comma_ 1982 below we will outline several projects undertaken in Cambridge as a context for highlighting its particularly useful characteristics insofar as they are relevant to this paper.
E87-1011.txt,46,LDOCE carries special lexicai and linguistic information which is useful for a number of natural language processing tasks.
E87-1011.txt,48,The dictionary is unique in tagging word senses with grammar code8 which provide very elaborate syntactic subcategorisation information a procedure has been developed for mapping the grammar codes into feature clusters in the style of e.g. Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar _comma_ subsequently to be used by a syntactic parser Boguraev and Briscoe_comma_ 1987_comma_ describe this in detail .
E87-1011.txt,49,The transformation program is about to be integrated in a software system for gram64 mar support and development_comma_ both as a lexicon enerator and as a tool for grammar debugging oguraev and Ritchie_comma_ 1987 .
E87-1011.txt,51,The pronunciation information in LDOCE has provided the basis for a study_comma_ in the larger context of speech recognition_comma_ of the implications of the phonetic structure of the English lexicon for different methods for lexical access Carter_comma_ 1986 .
E87-1011.txt,52,Again in the context of speech recognition_comma_ we intend to tackle the problem of word identification from a lattice of phonemes by constructing a parser that uses information about both phoneme collocations and syntactic predictions derived from independent analyses of the phonetic and grammar coding fields in the dictionary.
E87-1011.txt,54,Furthermore_comma_ LDOCE carries special tags_comma_ known as subjecf_comma_ and boz codas_comma_ which encode semantic notions like the overall context in which a word sense is likely to appear e.g. politics_comma_ religion_comma_ language and selectional restrictions on verbs_comma_ nouns and compound phrases we intend to use this information for further guidance during the word recognition process.
E87-1011.txt,55,Independently_comma_ an algorithm has been developed for analysing the semantic content proper of the dictionary entries by converting the definition texts in LDOCE into fragments of semantic networks Alshawi_comma_ 1987 this opens opportunities for building a comprehensive and robust semantic component which could then be incorporated into any of the projects mentioned above.
E87-1011.txt,56,It is clear that in order to make full use of the computerised LDOCE_comma_ we need a dictionary access system with proper DBMS functionality_comma_ capable of efficient retrieval of entries satisfying selection criteria applying at various levels of linguistic description.
E87-1011.txt,57,The design of the system described here allows precisely such heterogeneous requests.
E87-1011.txt,58,What we offer is a software environment buffering the user from the typically baroque and idiosyncratic format of the raw dictionary source and allowing_comma_ via a carefully crafted interface_comma_ multiple entry points and arbitrarily complex access paths into the on line lexical knowledge base.
E87-1011.txt,59,4 Requirements for the dictionary database Three main requirements can be identified if the database is to perform the functions intended for it.
E87-1011.txt,60,Firstly_comma_ the source tape of the dictionary must be converted into a format to which fast access can be coupled.
E87-1011.txt,61,This involves_comma_ at the very least_comma_ overall segmentation of the original character stream into records corresponding to gross lexical categories such as head word_comma_ pronunciation and part of speech.
E87-1011.txt,62,This may be a highly complex task_comma_ as in Kazman s 1986 project to restructure the text of the OED_comma_ or it may be conceptually fairly straightforward_comma_ as in the case of LDOCE where considerable segmentation is already present.
E87-1011.txt,63,But in either case_comma_ given that the on line dictionary is intended to support more than one application_comma_ a more elaborate structuring of the entries individual records might turn out to be unsuitable for further unforeseen use.
E87-1011.txt,64,Fortunately_comma_ it is clear from work with computerlsed dictionaries in general that once an application has located the relevant fragment of a dictionary entry_comma_ local parsing into whatever format is needed can be fast and reliable_comma_ and can therefore be done n the fiy by functions which manipulate individual entries on demand and have no permanent effect on the underlying source.
E87-1011.txt,65,Thus we should aim at incorporating the segmented version of the source intact into the database_comma_ to serve directly as its bottom layeff in the sense that all access paths ultimately point to complete dictionary entries_comma_ which are then returned as the results of queries.
E87-1011.txt,66,Secondly_comma_ it should be possible to execute queries involving information of as many different types as possible.
E87-1011.txt,67,Even if the machine readable source used is a comparatively structured one such as LDOCE_comma_ the creation of access paths will involve_comma_ for at least some types of information_comma_ the non trivlal but fast construction of an intermediate and temporary representation by means of the local parsing already mentioned.
E87-1011.txt,68,For example_comma_ subcategorisation information is often specified in a rather elliptical form in LDOCE_comma_ for the sake of human readability this must be made explicit by a parsing process_comma_ as described in Boguraev and Briscoe 1987 .
E87-1011.txt,69,Also_comma_ it is desirable to impose a phonologically motivated structure on pronunciations_comma_ which are typically given as a string of phonemes and stress markers.
E87-1011.txt,70,This will allow the user to specify a constraint on_comma_ say_comma_ the onset of the second syllable of the word s _comma_ whose position in the phoneme string will not be the same for all words.
E87-1011.txt,71,The straight indexing approach used by e.g.
E87-1011.txt,72,Boguraev and Briscoe 1987 for headword based access cannot in general provide sufficiently flexible access routes.
E87-1011.txt,73,Thirdly_comma_ the user or client program should be free to specify different types of constraint in any combination.
E87-1011.txt,74,We cannot assume in advance that information of a given type will always be present in great enough quantities to allow efficient retrieval.
E87-1011.txt,75,For example_comma_ if the system is being used by an automatic speech recogniser_comma_ then at one point in the signal significant information on pronunciation may be available_comma_ but few syntactic or semantic constraints may be present at another point_comma_ the situation may be reversed_comma_ with the speech signal itself yielding little phonological information but with an expectation driven parser providing quite specific higher level constraints.
E87-1011.txt,76,In each case_comma_ the stronger_comma_ more specific constraints must be used for access_comma_ and the weaker ones only for checking the entries retrieved.
E87-1011.txt,77,To achieve this_comma_ the system must clearly be able to estimate in advance what the most efficient search strategy will be.
E87-1011.txt,78,This ability to perform maximally efficient searches given many different kinds of constraint will also be important if the database is being used interactively to investigate properties of the language.
E87-1011.txt,79,If the system s claim to be interactive is to be justified_comma_ it must be able to tell the user in advance roughly how long a prospective query would take to evaluate_comma_ and roughly how many entries would be returned as a result.
E87-1011.txt,80,5 Design and implementation The design and implementation of the database system described here reflects the three requirements just identified.
E87-1011.txt,81,The machine readable source of LDOCE serves as the bottom layer of the database after undergoing a 65 lispification s process described in detail in Boguraev and Briscoe 1987 .
E87-1011.txt,82,This process preserves all the information_comma_ lexical and typographic_comma_ on the tape_comma_ and involves little restructuring_comma_ serving primarily to reformat the source in a bracketed form in which it can be much more easily read by Lisp programs.
E87-1011.txt,83,The link between the user or client program and the lisplfied dictionary is provided by a pointer file and a constraint file whose nature and motivation will be described below.
E87-1011.txt,84,5.1 Analysing dictionary entries Information of six different types is analysed for the construction of access paths semantic features classifying the meanings of words and their dependents semantic subject area grammatical part of speech grammatical subcategorisation British English pronunciations and definition texts.
E87-1011.txt,85,All these types can be mixed together in constructing search queries.
E87-1011.txt,86,Entries can also be accessed by spelling patterns.
E87-1011.txt,87,The codes used for the first three of these types of information have a fairly simple structure_comma_ and are hence trivial to extract.
E87-1011.txt,88,The fourth_comma_ subcategorisation_comma_ is indicated by a complex and highly discriminatory set of codes the extraction of these codes from the elliptical form in which they occur in LDOCE is described in Boguraev and Briscoe 1987 .
E87-1011.txt,89,We will therefore discuss here only the structuring of pronunciations and the treatment of definition texts.
E87-1011.txt,90,Pronunciations are represented in the dictionary as strings of phonente8 and primary and secondary stress markers.
E87-1011.txt,91,Syllable boundaries are not reliably indicated.
E87-1011.txt,92,Therefore_comma_ in order to allow the syllablebased access that a speech recogniser would probably require_comma_ pronunciation fields are parsed into syllables and_comma_ within a syllable_comma_ into onset_comma_ peak and coda_comma_ usin the phonotactic constraints given in Gimson 1980 and employing a rnazintal onset principle Selkirk_comma_ 1978 where these yield ambiguous syllable boundaries.
E87-1011.txt,93,Thus for example the internal syllable boundary in the pronunciation of constraint is placed before the s .
E87-1011.txt,94,The parser used for analysing pronunciations is a special purpose one whose very simple grammar is incorporated into its code.
E87-1011.txt,95,This allows pronunciations to be parsed many times faster than by a general purpose parser with a declarative grammar.
E87-1011.txt,96,It also allows constraints on relationships between syllable constituents to be relaxed when necessary.
E87-1011.txt,97,For example_comma_ the LDOCE pronunciation of bedouin is beduin which violates the constraint that a syllable whose peak is u as in put s cannot have a null coda this constraint is therefore relaxed to obtain a parse.
E87-1011.txt,98,The strategy used for indexing entries according to the words their definition texts was designed to reflect the fact that it is the semantic content of these words that is likely to be of interest to the user.
E87-1011.txt,99,This has two main consequences 1 It is more appropriate to take root forms of words as keys than to treat inflectional variants differently_comma_ because it is the root that holds most of the semantic content.
E87-1011.txt,100,Indeed_comma_ the inflection used with a particular word often depends on the largely arbitrary choice of syntactic constructions used in the definition.
E87-1011.txt,101,Thus for example_comma_ entries whose definitions contain any of the words fllm _comma_ films and filmed should all be indexed under film s .
E87-1011.txt,102,2 Closed class words are unlikely to be useful as keys because their semantic content is limited and often highly context dependent.
E87-1011.txt,103,In addition_comma_ many of them occur too often to be sufficiently discriminating for efficient lookup.
E87-1011.txt,104,Therefore only open class words are made available as keys.
E87-1011.txt,105,The task of deriving root forms of words is made much easier by the fact that LDOCE s definition texts are constructed largely from a set of two thousand basic words.
E87-1011.txt,106,When other words are used_comma_ they or_comma_ in the case of inflectional variants_comma_ their root forms are shown in a special font.
E87-1011.txt,107,Accurate root extraction for words not so marked can therefore be accomplished simply by stripping off affixes which are themselves in the basic word list and applying a few simple rules for spelling changes until a basic word is found.
E87-1011.txt,108,All irregular forms of basic words are stored explicitly.
E87-1011.txt,109,Distinguishing open and closed class words is also straightforward a 1 st of closed class words was derived by performing a database lookup using those grammar codes and categories that represent closed classes.
E87-1011.txt,110,5.2 Constructing access paths Once the relevant information has been extracted from an entry_comma_ constructing acess paths is straightforward in the grammatical_comma_ semantic and definition text cases a list of entry pointers is constructed for every code and every suitable definition word found in the dictionary.
E87-1011.txt,111,Pronunciations_comma_ however_comma_ are treated differently.
E87-1011.txt,112,To achieve flexibility and efficiency_comma_ a pointer list is formed for every distinct syllable in every position in which it occurs e.g. second syllable in a three syllable word .
E87-1011.txt,113,When the whole dictionary has been analysed_comma_ a pointer file is created containing all the entry pointer lists and_comma_ just before each llst_comma_ its length.
E87-1011.txt,114,As described below_comma_ this allows the system to estimate the work involved in evaluating a query without actually having to read the sometimes very long list itself.
E87-1011.txt,115,The next stage is to construct the constraint file.
E87-1011.txt,116,This file takes the form of a discrimination net which links every possible constraint on an entry e.g. a subject area_comma_ a grammar code or a constituent of a syllable to one or_comma_ in the pronunciation case_comma_ several lists in the pointer file.
E87-1011.txt,118,The menus are derived automatically from the constraint file_comma_ so that only queries with some chance of being satisfied can be constructed.
E87-1011.txt,119,For example_comma_ if the user is constructing a specification of a syllable_comma_ the tree at one point may be as in Figure 1.
E87-1011.txt,120,66 WORD PRONUNC I AT I ON S TRE3
E87-1011.txt,123,In this menu_comma_ and in terminal nodes of the PRONUNCIATION subtree of Figure 1_comma_  matches any sequence of symbols  matches any single symbol and all other symbols have the phonetic values defined for them in LDOCE .
E87-1011.txt,124,30 e 3 b g m n f V X .
E87-1011.txt,125,x 9 Figure 2 A tree can be constructed either from a WORD node alone_comma_ or by instructing the system to build a tree from the entry for a specified word_comma_ and then editing it.
E87-1011.txt,126,Once the tree is built_comma_ either a partial search to gather statistics or a full search to retrieve entries can be requested.
E87-1011.txt,128,The programs have been developed in Lisp_comma_ and make heavy use of the interactive graphic capabilities of Xerox s Lisp workstations.
E87-1011.txt,129,Nothing_comma_ however_comma_ depends critically on this the Interllsp D interactive graphics simply make the task of constructing search specifications very easy for the end user.
E87-1011.txt,130,The design is sufficiently modular to allow easy modification_comma_ and the system would be capable of functioning on a conventional minicomputer or mainframe as long as it supported random access to files just as well as it does on a single user workstation.
E87-1011.txt,131,In order to make the lexical knowledge base available to all the projects requiring access to it_comma_ the system had to be adapted to fit into the local environment of networked workstations.
E87-1011.txt,132,The database manager was easily repackaged to reflect the model of one server catering for several clients over a network the Remote Procedure Call Protocol XSIS_comma_ 1981 provided the necessary functionality to incorporate the manager into a dictionar t server node of the kind discussed by Kay_comma_ 1984  this bypassed the need for costly flleservers and proved the integrity of the design.
E87-1011.txt,133,We also plan to develop a version of the system running in Franz Lisp under UNIX and accessing the M_RC dictionary database Coltheart_comma_ 1981 .
E87-1011.txt,134,While the system implements in effect a linguistically motivated DBMS constructed round a suitable machine readable source_comma_ it stops short of full browsing capability even though such a capability could easily be added by fully integrating AlshawFs definitions analysis program into the overall design .
E87-1011.txt,135,In this sense the lexical knowledge base discussed here differs 68 from the concept of a lexical database as described in Calzolari 1986 _comma_ or underlying Miller s WORDNET 1985 .
E87-1011.txt,136,Nonetheless_comma_ the methodology described here is sufficiently flexible and powerful to satisfy a substantial proportion of the needs of the computational linguistics community till a proper mix of database and browsing capabilities becomes available.

E87-1023.txt,10,In the computational linguistics literature_comma_ the term preference has been used in different contexts.
E87-1023.txt,11,We shall mention a few_comma_ selectively_comma_ in section 2.1 which may be skipped and then state our own view in section 2.2 .
E87-1023.txt,13,Various approaches Preference strategies have often been used for dealing with the problem of illformed input a particular case of robustness_comma_ cf below section 2.2 AJCL 1983_comma_ Charniak 1983 .
E87-1023.txt,14,Following Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983 we distinguish the cases 134 where preference is part of the particular computation being performed Wilks 1973_comma_ Fass and Wilks 1983_comma_ Pereira 1985 from the case where it is a separate process_comma_ run after the results of the computation have been obtained Jensen et al 1983_comma_ Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983 .
E87-1023.txt,15,A frequent approach to preference is scoring.
E87-1023.txt,16,A numeric score is calculated_comma_ independently_comma_ for each competing interpretation and is then used to rank the interpretations.
E87-1023.txt,17,The best interpretations are then chosen.
E87-1023.txt,18,The score can be the number of constraints satisfied by the interpretation Wilks 1973_comma_ Fass Wilks 1983 _comma_ where these constraints might be assigned relative weights by the linguist Robinson 1982_comma_ Charniak 1983_comma_ Bennett and Slocum 1985 or calculated by the computer Papegaaij 1986 .
E87-1023.txt,19,Such techniques have been used extensively for speech recognition Paxton 1977_comma_ Walker et al 1978 and in the field of expert systems such as Mycin_comma_ Buchanan Shortliffe 1984 _comma_ where the calculation of both score and ranking become quite complex with probabilities and thresholds.
E87-1023.txt,20,The problem with scoring is that it seems quite unnatural for a linguist to associate a score or weight or probability to a particular rule or piece of data when the knowledge being encoded is in fact qualitative.
E87-1023.txt,21,Furthermore_comma_ combining the scores based on different types of reasoning to calculate a global score for a representation seems a rather arbitrary procedure.
E87-1023.txt,22,Such a uniform metric_comma_ even if it can model actual linguistic knowledge_comma_ forces the grammar writer to juggle with numbers to get the behaviour he wants_comma_ thus making the preference process obscure.
E87-1023.txt,23,A further disadvantage of this approach is that the score is often based on the way interpretations are built_comma_ rather than on the properties of the interpretations themselves.
E87-1023.txt,24,Preference is also mentioned in a linguistic controversy started by Frazier and Fodor 1979 with their principles of right association and minimal attachment Schubert 1984 .
E87-1023.txt,25,There the problem is to disambiguate many readings or interpretations of a sentence in order to find the good preferred one s .
E87-1023.txt,26,Various contributions on that issue have in common that bad interpretations are abandoned before being finished_comma_ during computation Shieber 1983_comma_ Pereira 1985 .
E87-1023.txt,27,Although this method speeds up the computation_comma_ there is a risk that a possiblity will be abandoned too early_comma_ before the relevant information has been found.
E87-1023.txt,28,This is shown by Wilks et al 1985 who claim to have the ideal solution in Preference Semantics_comma_ which uses as part of its computation scoring and ranking.
E87-1023.txt,30,Our notion of preference Our approach_comma_ although stemming from earlier work in the Eurotra project McNaught et al 1983_comma_ Johnson et al 1985 _comma_ is_comma_ we believe_comma_ new and original.
E87-1023.txt,31,We make the following assumptions i the relation translation of between texts as established by a machine translation system has to be one to one 1 1
E87-1023.txt,32,ii There is apriori no formal or linguistic guarantee that this will be the case for the relation as a whole or for the translation steps between intermediate levels of representation.
E87-1023.txt,33,An attempt to formalize this can be found in Krauwer and des Tombe 1984 or in section 4 of Johnson et al 1985 .
E87-1023.txt,34,The problem we want to address here is the following Given the fact that one to many l n translations do occur_comma_ how do we ensure that the final result is still I 1.
E87-1023.txt,35,This problem is not restricted to machine translation Often a program for example a parser or a text generator produces many interpretations of the same object usually a text segment when in the ideal case only one is wanted.
E87-1023.txt,36,In the following we refer to a l n translation for this general phenomenon.
E87-1023.txt,37,We see two types of solutions to this problem_comma_ each of them applicable to specific classes of cases i Spurious results can be eliminated on the basis of their own individual properties e.g. well formedness_comma_ completeness for this we will use the term filtering .
E87-1023.txt,38,ii Spurious results can be eliminated via comparison of competing representations_comma_ where only the best one s will have the right to survive for this we will use the term preference .
E87-1023.txt,39,It is important to note that we restrict ourselves to reducing l n translations to ideally i i.
E87-1023.txt,40,We will assume that the good translation is one of the candidates.
E87-1023.txt,41,The problem of forcing the system to come up with at least 1 translation i.e. do something about possible 1 0 cases will not be addressed here.
E87-1023.txt,42,In order to avoid confusion we will use the term robustness to refer to this type of problem.
E87-1023.txt,43,We are aware of the fact that we deviate slightly from the standard use of the term preference.
E87-1023.txt,44,135 There are two main types of l n ness i linguistically motivated i.e. real ambiguity in analysis_comma_ or true synonymy in generation .
E87-1023.txt,45,ii accidental_comma_ caused by overgeneration of the descriptive devices that define the resulting or intermediate interpretations.
E87-1023.txt,46,Note that overgeneration and ambiguity or synonymy may hide cases of undergeneration cf the robustness problem .
E87-1023.txt,47,We define the application of preference as the selection of the best element s from a set of competing interpretations of the same object.
E87-1023.txt,48,According to this definition the scoring and ranking mechanism described in the previous section is a case of preference.
E87-1023.txt,49,In the rest of this paper we will describe a preference device that is different from the scoring and ranking mechanism in the sense that it is not based on the way interpretations are built_comma_ but rather on linguistic properties Of the objects themselves.
E87-1023.txt,50,Its main characteristics are that it applies to complete and sound well formed interpretations only.
E87-1023.txt,51,That is_comma_ all the other modules of construction_comma_ transformation and filtering have been applied Ex parsing_comma_ Wh movement_comma_ etc .
E87-1023.txt,52,Thus_comma_ for these modules all competing representations are equivalent_comma_ and all the information needed for comparing them has been found.
E87-1023.txt,53,ii it is based on pairwise comparison between alternative competing interpretations of the same object.
E87-1023.txt,54,The problem can then be stated as follows How do we make use of the linguistic knowledge in order to insure a i i translation
E87-1023.txt,55,It is our basic belief that it is impossible for the linguist to know the exact nature of a class of competing interpretations in advance.
E87-1023.txt,56,This implies that he cannot in general formulate one single rule that picks out the best one.
E87-1023.txt,58,The proposed method 3.1.
E87-1023.txt,59,Basic idea Our proposal is the following It should be possible to make linguistic statements of the type if representation A has property X_comma_ and B property Y_comma_ then A is to be preferred over B e.g. in law texts declarative sentences are better than questions _comma_ or sentences with a main verb are better than sentences without one .
E87-1023.txt,60,On the basis of a set of such statements it should be possible to establish a partial order over the set of competing representations.
E87-1023.txt,61,And in that case the number of candidates can be reduced by_comma_ for example_comma_ letting only the maximal elements survive_comma_ or discarding the minimal ones.
E87-1023.txt,63,Problems with the method The first but least serious problem is that it is not certain that linguists will always be able to make such statements we will call them preference statements over pairs of representations.
E87-1023.txt,64,Experimentation is necessary.
E87-1023.txt,65,The second one is more serious it would be highly unrealistic to expect that the result of applying of the preference statements will be a linear order_comma_ in fact there is not even a guarantee that the order will be partial.
E87-1023.txt,66,In general the outcome will be a directed graph.
E87-1023.txt,67,There are three ways of tackling this problem The linguist should try to make the set of preference statements homogeneous and constrained_comma_ and should have control over the way in which they are applied_comma_ so that he can avoid contradictory statements.
E87-1023.txt,68,ii One tries to make a formal device that checks whether contradictions can Occur.
E87-1023.txt,69,iii One tries to compare pairs of competitors in a specific order such that it can be guaranteed that the result is always a partial order.
E87-1023.txt,70,At the moment iii is the most feasible_comma_ ii the most ambitious_comma_ and i the most desirable solution.
E87-1023.txt,71,Currently we envisage a combination of i and iii .
E87-1023.txt,72,The third problem is that of the maximal elements.
E87-1023.txt,73,Ideally there would be just one maximal element_comma_ i.e. the preferred representation.
E87-1023.txt,74,This cannot be guaranteed to be true.
E87-1023.txt,75,The problems sketched here are by no means trivial.
E87-1023.txt,76,That is why we want to experiment with a first implementation of this method_comma_ to identify the various relevant parameters in the specific context of Eurotra.
E87-1023.txt,78,The proposed implementation The implementation proposed here is described in very general terms_comma_ and can 136 be adapted for a wide range of applications.
E87-1023.txt,79,We give in the appendix some commented examples specific to our particular context.
E87-1023.txt,81,Preference rules Preference statements are expressed by the user in the form of rules preference rules .
E87-1023.txt,82,There are three types of preference rules simple rules_comma_ Dredefined rules and composite rules.
E87-1023.txt,83,A preference rule applied to two representations of interpretation tries to decide which one is better than the other preferred to the other .
E87-1023.txt,84,It is not guaranteed that a rule can always take a decision.
E87-1023.txt,85,A simple preference rule is of the form p Patternl Pattern2 The name of the rule is p_comma_ and Patternl and Pattern2 are current patterns.
E87-1023.txt,86,When given two arguments two representations or subparts A and B written p A_comma_B the system will try to match Patternl with A and Pattern2 with B.
E87-1023.txt,87,If this succeeds then A is better than B or A is preferred to B or A B .
E87-1023.txt,88,If it fails then the system will try to match A with Pattern2 and B with Patternl.
E87-1023.txt,89,If this succeeds then B is better than A.
E87-1023.txt,90,Predefined rules are provided for the cases where simple rules cannot express some useful basic preference statement.
E87-1023.txt,91,For example_comma_ in our actual implementation cf appendix _comma_ two Dredefined rules say that a tree structure with fewer more branches than the other is to be preferred to one with more fewer branches.
E87-1023.txt,92,This cannot be expressed with the particular language for patterns.
E87-1023.txt,93,A composite preference rule is of form p Patternl_comma_Pattern2  pl V_comma_ W _comma_ p2 X_comma_ Y _comma_ . . the Identifiers p_comma_ pl_comma_ p2_comma_ ... are rule names_comma_ Patternl and Pattern2 are actual patterns_comma_ and SV_comma_ W_comma_ X_comma_ Y_comma_ ... are variable identifiers_comma_ that should also occur in Patternl V_comma_ X and Pattern2 W_comma_ Y where they identify sub parts of the interpretations.
E87-1023.txt,94,When given two arguments A and B_comma_ the system tries to match A with Patternl and B with Pattern2.
E87-1023.txt,95,If this succeeds_comma_ the variables SV_comma_ X_comma_.. occurring in Patternl and SW_comma_ Y .... occurring in Pattern2 are instantiated to sub parts of A and B respectively.
E87-1023.txt,96,Then the system tries each preference rule of the list_comma_ with the instantiated arguments_comma_ till one rule can decide.
E87-1023.txt,97,In this case the relationship holding between A and B is the same as that holding between the sub part of A and the sub part of B.
E87-1023.txt,98,If no rule of the list can decide then preference is not decided.
E87-1023.txt,99,If the initial match doesn t succeed_comma_ then an attempt will be made to match A with Pattern2 and B with Patternl.
E87-1023.txt,100,If this succeeds the system tries the rules of the list in the same way as above.
E87-1023.txt,101,Composite preference rules allow recursion.
E87-1023.txt,102,This formalism is very much inspired by the programming language Prolog a preference rule is analogous to a three argument predicate two interpretations and the resulting relationship _comma_ a simple rule to an assertion_comma_ and a composite rule to a clause with sub goals.
E87-1023.txt,104,General algorithm Initially_comma_ all competing objects are in the set of non ordered objects N and the set of ordered objects O is empty.
E87-1023.txt,105,Then_comma_ the following is repeated until N is empty an object is removed from N and is compared to each object of O if any _comma_ then it is added to O.
E87-1023.txt,106,This algorithm does not ensure that the resulting directed graph of preference relationships among the competing objects has no cycle.
E87-1023.txt,107,Anyway_comma_ maximal minimal elements can be defined in the following way An object E is a maximal minimal element if no competing object is better worse than E.
E87-1023.txt,108,Thus an object in a cycle of the graph cannot be maximal minimal .
E87-1023.txt,109,To give the user control of how rules are tried on the competing objects_comma_ only one distinguished rule is applied to each competing pair.
E87-1023.txt,110,In the general case it should be a composite rule that just passes its two arguments to the rules of the list_comma_ thus ensuring that only these rules are tried and in that order.
E87-1023.txt,111,The pattern matching mechanism of composite rules is quite powerful. see also the appendix It allows some p.
E87-1035.txt,1,paper assesses two new approaches to deterministic parsing with respect to the analysis of unbounded dependencies UDs . UDs in English are highly locally and often globally ambiguous.
E87-1035.txt,2,Several researchers have argued that the difficulty of UDs undermines the programme of deterministic parsing.
E87-1035.txt,3,However_comma_ their conclusion is based on critiques of various versions of the Marcus parser which represents only one of many possible approaches to deterministic parsing.
E87-1035.txt,4,We examine the predictions made by a LR 1 deterministic parser and the Lexicat deterministic parser concerning the analysis of UDs.
E87-1035.txt,5,The LR 1 technique is powerful enough to resolve the local ambiguities we examine.
E87-1035.txt,6,However_comma_ the Lexicat model provides a more psychologically plausible account of the parsing of UDs_comma_ which also offers a unified account of the resolution of local and global ambiguities in these constructions. .
E87-1035.txt,7,Church 1980 117 and Johnson Laird 1983 313 have argued that the high degree of ambiguity in unbounded dependencies undermines the programme of deterministic parsing.
E87-1035.txt,8,Their conclusion is based on critiques of various versions of the Marcus parser Marcus_comma_ 1980 Berwick Weinberg_comma_ 1984 .
E87-1035.txt,9,This parser represents only one of many possible approaches to deterministic parsing..
E87-1035.txt,10,Therefore_comma_ the conclusion that deterministic parsing_comma_ m general_comma_ is impractical or psychologically implausible may be premature.
E87-1035.txt,11,In the next section_comma_ we outline the problems for the deterministic analysis of unbounded dependencies.
E87-1035.txt,12,In the succeeding sections_comma_ we present two alternative parsing techniques and associated grammars which make differing predictions concerning the onset and location of indeterminacy in the analysis of unbounded dependencies.
E87-1035.txt,13,We argue that the LR 1 parser is capable of deterministically resolving the local ambiguities which occur in these constructions_comma_ whilst the Lexicat parser is not.
E87-1035.txt,14,In the final section_comma_ we evaluate these predictions in the light of the Determinism Hypothesis Marcus_comma_ 1980 and the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis Briscoe Boguraev_comma_ 1984 Briscoe_comma_ in press and argue that the Lexicat parser in conjunction with the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis provides the most psychologically plausible and unified account of the parsing of unbounded dependencies.
E87-1035.txt,15,UNBOUNDED DEPENDENCY AMBIGUITIES Unbounded dependencies are found in English constituent questions_comma_ relative clauses and topicalised constructions.
E87-1035.txt,16,The dependency is between the preposed constituent and its point of attachment.
E87-1035.txt,17,For example_comma_ in 1 Who is preposed and functioning as direct object of the transitive verb like.
E87-1035.txt,18,I Who do you like _e Most current theories of grammar represent the grammatical role of the prcposcd constituent by associating it with the normal position of a constituent having that grammatical role.
E87-1035.txt,19,In several theories_comma_ this position is occupied by a phonologically null category or trace which is grammatically linked to the prcposed constituent.
E87-1035.txt,20,Wc will use _e to mark this position because each of the grammars associated with the parsers we consider adopts a positional account of the recovery of the grammatical role of the preposed constituent.
E87-1035.txt,21,However_comma_ we use _c to mark an unambiguous point of attachment without any commitment to the presence of phonologically null categories or su ucmrc in the syntactic representation of unbounded dependencies.
E87-1035.txt,22,The dependency between preposed constituent and point of attachment is unbounded because an unlimited amount of lexical material can occur between these two points in grammatical English constructions of this type.
E87-1035.txt,23,For example_comma_ it is possible to construct more and more embedded examples like those in 2 which exhibit the same dependency as I .
E87-1035.txt,24,2 Who do you think Kim likes c_ Who do you expect that Kim hopes Sandy likes e A parser for English capable of producing a syntactic representation adequate to guide semantic interpretation must recover the grammatical role of thc preposed constituent.
E87-1035.txt,25,However_comma_ whenever these constructions contain verbs of ambiguous valency thc correct point of attachment for the preposcd constituent also becorncs ambiguous.
E87-1035.txt,26,For example_comma_ in 3 there are two potential attachment points_comma_ or doubtful gaps Fodor_comma_ 1979 _comma_ written e .
E87-1035.txt,27,3 Who do you want e to succeed e
E87-1035.txt,28,The correct attachment of Who is ambiguous because both want and succeed can take_comma_ but do not require_comma_ NP objects.
E87-1035.txt,29,211 The ambiguity in 3 is global with respect to the sentence however_comma_ identical local ambiguities exist for a parser operating incrementally from left to fight.
E87-1035.txt,30,For example_comma_ in 4 the attachment of Who as object of want_comma_ although correct_comma_ remains doubtful until the end of the sentence.
E87-1035.txt,31,4 Who do you want e to succeed Bill Thus_comma_ at the point when the parser reaches a potential hut ambiguous attachment point in the left to fight analysis of the input_comma_ it cannot be sure that this is the correct attachment point because there may be another further downstream in the input_comma_ as in 3 .
E87-1035.txt,32,Moreover_comma_ the point of attachment further downstream may be unambiguous and obligatory_comma_ resolving the local ambiguity in the other direction_comma_ as in 5 .
E87-1035.txt,33,5 Who do you want e to replace fi To resolve the local ambiguities in unbounded dependencies the parser requires access to an unbounded amount of left and fight context_comma_ measured in terms of lexical material.
E87-1035.txt,34,Firsdy_comma_ when a potential attachment point is found_comma_ the parser must know whether or not a preposed constituent exists to be attached.
E87-1035.txt,35,This requires potentially unbounded access to the left context of the analysis since the preposed constituent could have occurred an unbounded distance hack from its point of attachment.
E87-1035.txt,36,Secondly_comma_ when a potential but ambiguous attachment point is found_comma_ the parser must decide whether it is the correct point of attachment.
E87-1035.txt,37,However_comma_ since this decision cannot be made determinately when the potential attachment point occurs_comma_ the parser requires access to the right context of forthcoming material downstream from the current position.
E87-1035.txt,38,The examples in 6 illustrate that this would require unbounded lookahead.
E87-1035.txt,39,6 Who does Kim want e to think that the boss will replace Sandy with e_. Who does Kim want e to think that the boss expects the directors to replace Sandy with e_e In 6 the t point of attachment cannot be determined until the end of the sentence which can be arbitrarily far away in terms of lexical material in the fight context.
E87-1035.txt,40,Berwick Weinberg 1984 153f argue that the Marcus parser can adequately represent an unbounded left context with fufite resources if a successive cyclic and trace theoretic analysis eg. Chomsky_comma_ 1981 of unbounded dependencies is adopted.
E87-1035.txt,41,However_comma_ both Church 1980 and Fodor 1985 demonstrate that the three cell lookahead buffer in the Marcus parser is not powerful enough to provide the required access to the right context in order to choose the correct point of attachment deterministicaUy in many unbounded dependency constructions.
E87-1035.txt,42,Marcus 1980 Determinism Hypothesis claims that local ambiguities which are not resolvable in terms of the lookahead buffer are resolved by parsing strategy and that therefore_comma_ many unbounded dependency constructions should be psychologically complex_comma_ garden paths requiring extensive reanalysis.
E87-1035.txt,43,There is some evidence for syntactic p.
E87-1047.txt,1,paper is part of an enterprise whose aim is to represent linguistic knowledge in the form of a molecular machine a dynamic network . That is_comma_ the molecules of the network not only store_comma_ but also send_comma_ receive_comma_ and process information.
E87-1047.txt,2,It is claimed that such a network can be conceived of as a model of the coalition structure of a connectionist network.
E87-1047.txt,3,The paper describes how the class of feature systems called unary feature hierarchies whose importance is supported by phonological theory but will not be argued for in the paper can be represented in the molecular machine. .
E87-1047.txt,4,Of the various branches of modern linguistic theory_comma_ phonology_comma_ as usual_comma_ was the first one to come up with really restrictive theories of features and feature systems_comma_ largely supported by empirical evidence coming from the study of a legion of linguistic phenomena.
E87-1047.txt,5,Phonology will most probably remain main source of evidence as far as the functioning of feature based cognitive processes is concerned.
E87-1047.txt,6,The present paper sets out to outline how a particular kind of feature system_comma_ close to several recent theories of phonological features_comma_ can be represented in connectionist networks.
E87-1047.txt,7,However_comma_ since some of the mechanisms involved_comma_ seriality and synchronization in particular_comma_ fall outside the scope of the existing connectionist networks_comma_ a nonconnectionist model simulating would be serial connectionist networks will be used instead.
E87-1047.txt,8,The automaton described in the paper is able to unify feature structures as programs to be run on the machine itself.
E87-1047.txt,9,UNARY FEATURE HIERARCHIES The feature systems under scrutiny can be termed unary feature hierarchies.
E87-1047.txt,10,The underlying concept is close to the feature geometry approach to autosegmental phonology Clements 1985 in that a feature specification consists of features appearing on tiers_comma_ and features on adjacent tiers can be linked by association ines.
E87-1047.txt,11,Tiers are ordered in a multi dimensional space_comma_ and the set of features that may appear on a particular tier is predefined.
E87-1047.txt,12,Unarity_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ means that a feature either appears within a given span of time or it does not instead of having different values the absence of a feature simply means lack of information or undersDecification.
E87-1047.txt,13,Features can only be linked to specified slots on the other hand_comma_ tiers are adjacent to features rather than to tiers hence the use of hierarchv instead of qeometry that is_comma_ the following configuration may be ruled out if the H tier is adjacent to F but not to G F G tier .... F .... G .... l I H tier .... H .... H .... Figure I.
E87-1047.txt,14,This configuration may be ruled out.
E87-1047.txt,15,Unarity is opposed to traditional binary feature systems with a marked  and an unmarked  value for each feature and to ternary systems with a marked _comma_ an unmarked _comma_ and an unspecified 0 value _comma_ while feature geometries and hierarchies replace the old fashioned feature bundle conception_comma_ in which each segment consisted of an unordered set of feature value pairs.
E87-1047.txt,16,Compare the following sketchy representations of lax vowels in English 298 Features Segments e i A o D u Low    High    Back    Round  Figure 2.
E87-1047.txt,17,English lax vowels as feature bundles.
E87-1047.txt,18,Tiers Segments e ziAo9 u Root tier x x x x x x x I I I I I I H L B tier L H B B B B I I I R tier R R R I I H L tier L H Figure 3.
E87-1047.txt,19,Unary feature hierarchy for English lax vowels.
E87-1047.txt,20,That is_comma_ in this approach_comma_ feature hierarchies not only express universal restrictions on feature structures as feature geometries do_comma_ cf. Clements 1985 _comma_ but language specific redundancy rules and feature co occurrence restrictions as well.
E87-1047.txt,21,In addition to the above_comma_ we shall assume the possibility of forbidding that a feature or_comma_ rather_comma_ any feature of a given tier be linked to another.
E87-1047.txt,22,Link prohibitions are not intended to be a feature value_comma_ hence the below representations a. b.
E87-1047.txt,23,Tier 1 .... F ........ F .... X Tier 2 Figure 4.
E87-1047.txt,24,Configurations with and without link prohibition. specify identical elements_comma_ in spite of the fact that no feature can be linked to F in Figure 4a.
E87-1047.txt,25,X stands for link prohibition. For example_comma_ consider the following feature hierarchy_comma_ characterizing a language where plural and dual nouns usually behave in the same way e.g. Hebrew 1 2 3 4 5 Category tier N .... N .... N .... N .... N I x I I Number tier ....... NSg ....... NSg NSg I x Dual tier D i singular noun 2 plural noun 3 sinaulare tantum 4 dual noun and duale tantum 5 plurale tantum Figure 5.
E87-1047.txt,26,Sample feature system.
E87-1047.txt,27,In terms of the above_comma_ the features of plural nouns and Dluralia tantum are identical_comma_ in spite of the link prohibition concerning the Non Singular feature of the latter.
E87-1047.txt,28,CONNECTIONIST MODEL OF FEATURE SYSTEMS Obviously_comma_ the presence of a feature in a segment corresponds to a relatively high activation level of a node or a coalition of nodes in a connectionist network.
E87-1047.txt,29,The vertical geometry of tiers determines the possibilities of linking the essential function of links is to synchronize the activation of features_comma_ but they also express their dependency relations.
E87-1047.txt,30,Thus association lines corespond to the fact that the activation of a node or coalition controls the activation of another node or coalition.
E87-1047.txt,31,Finally_comma_ link prohibitions can be represented as the inhibition of particular tiers.
E87-1047.txt,32,The adjacency of tiers will correspond to super coalitions_comma_ i.e. features on adjacent tiers are features whose activation can be synchronized at all.
E87-1047.txt,33,In our present knowledge_comma_ none of the existing connectionist networks can learn and encode the sequential activation of nodes or coalitions of nodes_comma_ albeit the organization of human memory is most probably highly serialized.
E87-1047.txt,34,To overcome this deficiency and for other reasons as well we designed a molecular machine cf. Kalm n and Kornai 1985 to model the functioning of a sequential connectionist network.
E87-1047.txt,35,In this machine_comma_ each molecule contains a more or less stable piece of knowledge encoding the coalition structure it participates in_comma_ in the form of a layout of the surrounding network.
E87-1047.txt,36,299 Molecules are able to send messages to each other a message has the same form as the pieces of information stored in the molecules_comma_ i.e. it is a directed graph representing a substructure of molecules with their dependencies.
E87-1047.txt,37,When a molecule receives a message_comma_ it unifies the message with its own map_comma_ and it forwards the resulting information.
E87-1047.txt,38,The ultimate addressees are the output molecules _comma_ which can perform extra actions when receiving a properly addressed message.
E87-1047.txt,39,That is_comma_ the message acts as a program that will_comma_ after some modifications it undergoes_comma_ activate a set of output molecules in a well defined order Modifications correspond to the effects of the rules stored in the molecules on the path of the message.
E87-1047.txt,40,One of the most important characteristics of the messages sent and other maps is that they may contain missing steps_comma_ i.e. distinguished nodes encoding lack of information concerning the way between two nodes.
E87-1047.txt,41,Missing steps can be eliminated by unification_comma_ provided that the required path is specified in the map of a processing molecule.
E87-1047.txt,42,This mechanism corresponds to the function of super coalitions _comma_ i.e. the synchronization and sequencing of the activation of otherwise distinct coalitions.
E87-1047.txt,43,INFORMATION PROCESSING WITH THE MOLECULAR MACHINE The basic operation performed by the molecular machine is a kind of unification_comma_ differing from the corresponding operation used in unification based grammars by virtue of the differences in the feature structures and their representations.
E87-1047.txt,44,Since the map graphs of the molecular machine contain no node variables_comma_ unification essentially means the elimination of missing steps.
E87-1047.txt,45,Missing steps encode both alternative and conjunctive relations A B V C D Figure 6.
E87-1047.txt,46,Sample directed graph with missing step.
E87-1047.txt,47,The missing step the asterisk in Figure 6 can only be eliminated by supplying a path from A and B to either C or D_comma_ e.g. by unifying the graph in Figure 6 with the following A B C Figure 7.
E87-1047.txt,48,Sample directed graph without missing step.
E87-1047.txt,49,Figure 7 is also the resulting graph.
E87-1047.txt,50,Any other unification will pr_comma_ vide a partial solution at best.
E87-1047.txt,51,The control function of the directed graphs in question is due to the fact that the addressed molecules are able to reduce the messages they receive.
E87-1047.txt,52,For example_comma_ in the case of the graph on Figure 7_comma_ both molecules A and B will remove their addresses from the top level before forwarding the graph.
E87-1047.txt,53,The graph on Figure 6_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ will be unable to activate any of the addressees because of the missing step it contains.
E87-1047.txt,54,The unification and control functions of the molecular machine together define a particular conception of phonological rule systems_comma_ which can be argued for on independent grounds as well.
E87-1047.txt,55,Under this approach_comma_ the function of a phonological rule system is essentially to resolve problems arising from morphological processes_comma_ i.e. to fix ill formed representations resulting from affixation by supplying missing features e.g. in vowel harmony _comma_ linking or delinking features according to the derived context e.g. in voice assimilation .
E87-1047.txt,56,Note that delinking in the present form of the machine consists of adding an inhibitory link leading to the feature to be delinked.
E87-1047.txt,57,FURTHER PLANS_comma_ IMPLEMENTATION It is far from evident that syntactic and semantic rule systems should carry out operations similar to those in phonological rules.
E87-1047.txt,58,On the other hand_comma_ the operation of the molecular machine are general enough to eventually encompass syntactic and semantic processes such as recognition and completion of syntactic patterns_comma_ inference making through unification_comma_ etc. Some of these operations are outlined in Kalman and Kornai 1985 and Kalman 1986 .
E87-1047.txt,59,300 A small molecular machine is implemented in Zoltan Schreter s FPSE_comma_ Geneva University CNS connectionist simulation system running on Olivetti M24 M28 PCs.
E87-1047.txt,60,However_comma_ owing to the capacity of the machines and of TLC Lisp_comma_ in which the system has been written the number of molecules is extremely limited_comma_ and the performance obtained is rather poor. .
E87-1013.txt,1,novel approach to the problem of text understanding is presented_comma_ which exploits a distributed processing concept_comma_ where knowledge from different sources comes into play in the course of comprehension. In the paper the rationale of advocating such an approach and the.advantages in following it are discussed.
E87-1013.txt,2,A prototype parser based on an original distributed problem solving architecture is presented.
E87-1013.txt,3,It encompasses a centralized declarative control module and a collection of decentralized_comma_ loosely coupled_comma_ heterogeneous problem solvers specialized in the vadous facets of the parsing task.
E87-1013.txt,4,The mechanisms of coordination and communication among the specialists are illustrated_comma_ and an example of the parser operation is given.
E87-1013.txt,5,The parser is implemented in LISP on a SUN workstation.
E87-1013.txt,7,The processes underlying text understanding involve a variety of complex_comma_ multifaceted activities which have not been yet completely understood from the cognitive point of view_comma_ and which still lack adequate computational models.
E87-1013.txt,8,Recent research trends in cognitive science and artificial intelligence_comma_ however_comma_ have put forward some ideas conoeming human cognition and automatic problem solving that offer promising tools for the design of text understanding systems.
E87-1013.txt,9,One of the key ideas emerged in the field of cognitive study of natural language comprehension is that text understanding constitutes in humans an interactive process_comma_ where bottom up_comma_ datadriven activities combine with top down_comma_ expectation driven ones to cooperatively determine the most I ely interpretation of the input Lesgoid and Perfetti_comma_ 1981 .
E87-1013.txt,10,Roughly speaking_comma_ humans begin with a set of expectations about what information is likely to be found in the text.
E87-1013.txt,11,These expectations are based both on linguistic knowledge about words_comma_ phrases_comma_ sentences_comma_ and larger pieces of discourse and on non linguistic world knowledge.
E87-1013.txt,12,As information from the text becomes available_comma_ the reader strengthens those hypotheses that are consistent with the input and weakens those that are inconsistent.
E87-1013.txt,13,The stronger hypotheses_comma_ in turn_comma_ make even more specific predictions about the information represented in the text_comma_ so as the initial expectations are successively corrected and refined until they eventually yield an adequate approximation of the meaning of the text.
E87-1013.txt,14,In one of the first and mere detailed descriptions of interactive processes in text understanding_comma_ Rumelhart 1977 has proposed a model comprising several knowledge sources_comma_ each one operating independently and in parallel with the others.
E87-1013.txt,15,These knowledge sources are processors operating at different levels of linguistic representation.
E87-1013.txt,16,The outputs of each of these knowledge sources are hypotheses or best guesses from the data available at that level.
E87-1013.txt,17,The hypotheses are transferred to a central device_comma_ called the message center_comma_ where they can be observed by all other knowledge sources_comma_ thus being available as evidence for or against hypotheses at other levels.
E87-1013.txt,18,In a more dynamic view of interaction_comma_ Levy 1981 suggests that the message center could modify the activity of each individual processor.
E87-1013.txt,19,That is_comma_ when a particular hypothesis has strong outside support_comma_ the analyzers of a particular knowledge source may change their own processing either to seek confirming evidence for it or to accept that view and therefore stop analyzing information that would otherwise have been tested.
E87-1013.txt,20,The idea of decomposing a difficult problem into a large number of functionally distinct subproblems_comma_ each one being tackled by a specialized problem solver_comma_ has been pursued with great interest in the last years also in the field of artificial intelligence_comma_ where the area of distributed problem solving has developed into a much researched and hot topic.
E87-1013.txt,21,Several computational paradigms have been proposed_comma_ such as blackboard systems for a review_comma_ see Nil_comma_ 1986a 1986b _comma_ contract net Davis and Smith_comma_ 1983 _comma_ the scientific community metaphor Komfeid and Hewitt_comma_ 1981 _comma_ FA C systems Lesser and Corkill_comma_ 1981 which proved appropriate to several tasks and application domains.
E87-1013.txt,22,As far as the field of text understanding is concerned_comma_ we mention here the work of Cullingford 1981 on DSAM_comma_ the distributed script applier_comma_ in which an arbitrary number of distinct_comma_ potentially distributed_comma_ processors are used to read and summarize newspaper stories.
E87-1013.txt,23,In this paper we present a novel approach to the problem of text understanding through a distributed processing paradigm_comma_ where different knowledge sources come into play and cooperate in the course of comprehension.
E87-1013.txt,24,In section two we deal with the rationale of advocating such an approach and the advantages and disadvantages in following it.
E87-1013.txt,25,Section three illustrates the general architecture of a prototype distributed parser_comma_ and describes the mechanisms of coordination and communication among the various knowledge sources.
E87-1013.txt,26,In section four we present an example of the parser operation through the tracing of the analysis of a sample sentence.
E87-1013.txt,27,Finally_comma_ section five deals with the current state of the implementation and highlights the novelty and originality of the approach.
E87-1013.txt,29,RATIONALE AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Several reasons recommend and support the choice of a distributed approach to text understanding.
E87-1013.txt,30,From a cognitive point of view_comma_ it is indubitable that humans perform such an activity incrementally.
E87-1013.txt,31,That is_comma_ not all what can be derived from a text becomes evident since the very beginning.
E87-1013.txt,32,Some features of the text are understood almost automatically and with minimum effort_comma_ others require more labor_comma_ whereas still others become clear only after a thoughtful process.
E87-1013.txt,33,This increasing depth of processing_comma_ which has differential effects about what is understood from the same piece of text 75 should be modeled also in an automatic system.
E87-1013.txt,34,A distributed architecture comprising a collection of specialized problem solvers specialists with different skill and competence_comma_ and working with different knowledge sources_comma_ seems a promising way to achieve incremsntallty.
E87-1013.txt,35,Such an architecture offers several advantages from a technical point of view_comma_ too.
E87-1013.txt,36,About these we mention the possibility to adopt different techniques and methodologies for each specialist_comma_ the fact that specialists can be developed in isolation independently from each other the possibility to change one or more specialists without implying a global restructuring of the whole system_comma_ the robustness that can be achieved by overlapping the capabilities of different specialists. the facility in designing and debugging_comma_ The main problem in adopting a distributed approach is that of control_comma_ i.e. making the specialists cooperate.
E87-1013.txt,37,As Cullingford 1981 52 puts it_comma_ ... In an ideal system each expert would become available only when needed_comma_ run only so long as it had something useful to do and communicate its findings to interested parties in an efficient manner.
E87-1013.txt,38,If an appropriate level of integration could be achieved_comma_ one could hope to improve the capabilities of an mderstanding system by adding new knowledge sources_comma_ to reuse experts in different problem domains and to investigate the relative performance degradation due to removing various knowledge sources. . In our approach we adopt a form of control based on the interaction of each individual specialist with a central manager_comma_ which super vises and directs the overall operation of the system by coordinating the autonomous activities of the specialists bottom up approach _comma_ and by exploiting its own general problem solving strategies top down approach _comma_ The prototype distributed parser which has been developed according to the ideas outlined above works in the domain of descriptive text understanding_comma_ more precisely computer science literature on operating systems.
E87-1013.txt,39,It receives in input a natural language text and produces in output a semantic representation of its meaning in the BLR ELR representation language Fum_comma_ Guida_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1984 .
E87-1013.txt,40,Three main objectivers have been taken into account in the design of the parser Incrementality of parsing and generation of the BLR ELR.
E87-1013.txt,41,AS the parser has to cover a large variety of linguistic features and must rely upon k number of different knowledge sources_comma_ it seems appropriate that both analysis of the input text and generation of the BLR ELR representation are carded out in a stepwise manner through successive additions and refinements.
E87-1013.txt,42,Also the structure itself of the BLR ELR formalism_comma_ made up of a collection of propositions appropriately connected together and supplemented with additional information e.g._comma_ about time_comma_ quantification_comma_ etc. _comma_ strongly suggests an incremental approach to parsing.
E87-1013.txt,44,The parser should not only produce a correct BLR ELR representation of the input text_comma_ but it should also show some degree of linguistic competence in the way it operates intemally.
E87-1013.txt,45,In other words_comma_ it should provide an acceptable approximation of the basic mental processes that occur in humans.
E87-1013.txt,47,The parser should be capable of operating in an efficient and correct way in non trivial cases.
E87-1013.txt,48,Moreover_comma_ the parser should be easy to design and debug.
E87-1013.txt,50,A DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE 3.1 Overall System Architecture As mentioned above_comma_ our distributed parser is constituted by a collection of individual specialists_comma_ each one expert in a facet of the parsing problem e.g._comma_ syntactic analysis_comma_ disambiguation_comma_ reference_comma_ semantics_comma_ time_comma_ quantification_comma_ BLR ELR construction_comma_ etc. .
E87-1013.txt,51,Each specialist is an autonomous problem solver_comma_ which has its own competence domain_comma_ where it can operate with certain and complete knowledge.
E87-1013.txt,52,However_comma_ it is assumed that no specialist has enough knowledge and competence to cover the whole parsing activity all or most of them are necessary to successfully complete the parsing of a complex text.
E87-1013.txt,53,Moreover_comma_ we assume that specialists may be heterogeneous_comma_ i.e._comma_ implemented using different technologies e.g._comma_ a deterministic algorithm_comma_ a knowledge based system_comma_ etc. .
E87-1013.txt,54,Also_comma_ they may have partially overlapping competence areas_comma_ and even be redundant_comma_ i.e. there may be several specialists for the same task e.g._comma_ for syntactic analysis .
E87-1013.txt,55,As we have stated that specialists are independent problem solvers_comma_ we also assume that they have no mutual knowledge they do not know about each other_comma_ they do not even know about the existence of other specialists.
E87-1013.txt,56,This assumption is very important to allow a fully independent design of an individual specialist_comma_ without bothering about the others.
E87-1013.txt,57,Each specialist can solve a well defined class of problems_comma_ and once a problem has been assigned to it_comma_ it can result in three different outcomes succeas_comma_ i.e. the problem assigned has been solved and its solution produced fail_comma_ i.e. the specialist has been unable to solve the problem and an alarm message is returned need help_comma_ i.e. the specialist has been successful in decomposing and partially solving the problem at hand_comma_ but it needs help from outside to proceed further in the solution process.
E87-1013.txt,58,In this case_comma_ the current problem is suspended_comma_ and sub problems are generated for which solutions are needed.
E87-1013.txt,59,The intemal operation of each specialist is not of interest here_comma_ as we have assumed that they may be heterogeneous.
E87-1013.txt,60,What is crucial is the interface they show towards the outside which is expected to be very simple.
E87-1013.txt,61,A specialist may receive a problem to solve_comma_ and issue a solution_comma_ other problems_comma_ or an alarm.
E87-1013.txt,62,It may also receive a solution to one of the sub problems it has previously generated_comma_ which will be used to resume the solution process of some suspended problem.
E87-1013.txt,63,3.2 Communication and Control Mechanisms Specialists are not allowed to directly communicate to each other_comma_ but can only communicate to a cooperation manager_comma_ which is in charge of organizing and controlling the overall activity of the parser.
E87-1013.txt,64,It embodies knowledge about the actual architecture of the system_comma_ i.e. how many and which specialists are available the competence of each individual specialist how to match problems to specialists in order to exploit in the best way their specific capabilities how to schedule the activity of the specialists_comma_ i.e. which specialists to activate first_comma_ taking into account priority and redundancy problems how to correctly switch messages among specialists.
E87-1013.txt,65,76 The communication between specialists and the cooperation manager occurs according to a fixed protocol which includes three basic types of messages_comma_ namely prob ems_comma_ solutions_comma_ and alarms. as already outlined above.
E87-1013.txt,66,The working memory of the parser is a partitioned shared memory_comma_ where each specialist can read and write in its own partition only_comma_ but has full visibility on the entire memory.
E87-1013.txt,67,Clearly_comma_ in order to allow specialists to work correctly on the shared memory_comma_ it is necessary that a common representation language is adopted_comma_ at least for information that may conoem more than one specialist.
E87-1013.txt,68,The operation of the cooperation manager is basically messagedriven it is all the time waiting for messages and_comma_ as soon as messages arrive from the specialists_comma_ they are stored in a buffer and later examined and treated according to some specific policy e.g._comma_ the pdority of the messages or their origin may be taken into account .
E87-1013.txt,69,The cooperation manager is in charge of three main activities it assigns problems to specialists according to their competence_comma_ current work load_comma_ etc. it passes solutions to the relevant specialists i.e._comma_ those who issued the sub problem to which the solution refers it manages alarms e.g._comma_ by resorting to alternative specialists with similar or overlapping competence .
E87-1013.txt,70,The cooperation manager_comma_ however_comma_ in addition to the above mentioned message handling capability_comma_ has also its own strategies that can override_comma_ when needed_comma_ the basic message driven style_comma_ thus affecting the overall operation of the parser.
E87-1013.txt,71,These strategies_comma_ that embed knowledge about how to manage the parsing task _comma_ are crucial to the successful activity of the parser H we really want to allow individual specialists to be designed and constructed independently from each other.
E87-1013.txt,72,In fact_comma_ as no global strategy is coded in the system_comma_ if must be explicitly assigned as an additional competence to the cooperation manager.
E87-1013.txt,73,3.3 The Specialists As illustrated above_comma_ our distn buted parser is well suited to host a large vadety of specialists.
E87-1013.txt,74,We will briefly list in the following some of those utilized in the current implementation of the system.
E87-1013.txt,75,The Morphology Specialist MS is devoted to perform the morphological analysis of each word_comma_ i.e. extracting from the Dictionary all the relevant information and determining the appropriate morphological types and variables.
E87-1013.txt,76,The Encyclopedia Specialist ES is able to access the Encyclopedia for extracting semantic information and world knowledge.
E87-1013.txt,77,The Syntax Specialist SYS is able to identify the constituents of a sentence and to build up a parse tree.
E87-1013.txt,78,The current version is implemented through a context froe grammar augmented with transformational rules.
E87-1013.txt,79,The Semantics Specialist SES is devoted to a semantic analysis of a sentence performed only through semantic information_comma_ discarding any syntactic processing.
E87-1013.txt,80,The Syntax Semantics Specialist SSS is able to complement semantic analysis with available syntactic information and viceversa in order_comma_ for example_comma_ to resolve ambiguities.
E87-1013.txt,81,The 77me Specialist TS is able to attach to each proposition of the BLR ELR the appropriate temporal information.
E87-1013.txt,82,The Reference Specialist RS is devoted to analyze pronominal and anaphoric .
E87-1006.txt,1,morphologic and morphosyntactic analyzer for the Italian language has been implemented in VM Prolog 131 at the IBM Romc Scientific Center as part of a project on text understanding. Aim of this project is the development of a prototype which analyzes short narrative texts press agency news and gives a formal representation of their meaning as a set of first order logic expressions.
E87-1006.txt,2,Question answering features are also provided.
E87-1006.txt,3,The morphologic analyzer processes every word by means of a context free grammar_comma_ in order to obtain its morphologic and syntactic characteristics.
E87-1006.txt,4,It also performs a morphosyntactic analysis to recognize fixed and variable sequences of words such as idioms_comma_ date cxpressi ns_comma_ compound tenses of verbs and comparative and superlative form of adjectives.
E87-1006.txt,7,Its task is to solve syntactic ambiguities and recognize semantic relations between the words of the sentence 191.
E87-1006.txt,8,This paper deals in particular with the structure of the lexicon adopted in tht system and with the morhologic and morhosynlactic analyzer.
E87-1006.txt,9,In this system the morphology and the lexicon are strictly combined for this reason this lexicon does not contain semanlic information.
E87-1006.txt,11,The lexicon realized by ZampoUi s working group containes morphologie hints in order to guide directly the analysis of every word_comma_ without the support of a morphologic p rser. in most of the works referring to English language morphology is considered onl as a part of the syntactic parser.
E87-1006.txt,12,On the contrary.
E87-1006.txt,13,Italian morpho ogy requires to be previously analyzed because it is more complex there are more rules than in English and these rides present many exceptions.
E87-1006.txt,15,The second one has been realized by Delmonte_comma_ Mian_comma_ Omologo and Satta_comma_ as part of a system for the development of a reading machine for blind people.
E87-1006.txt,17,In the first section of this paper there is a brief discussion atx_comma_ ut morphologic problems and about the possible approaches to their solution.
E87-1006.txt,18,The next section describes the structure adopted for the lexicon and the other sets of data.
E87-1006.txt,19,The third section deals with a preanalyzer_comma_ which simplifies the work of morphologie analysis by recognizing standard sequences of words_comma_ as idioms and date expressions.
E87-1006.txt,20,In the fourth section the morphologic analyzer is described and in the last one the morphosyntactic analyzer_comma_ both realized by means of context free grammars.
E87-1006.txt,21,The problem The aim of morphology is to retrieve from every analyzed word the lemma it derives from_comma_ its syntactic category e.g. verb_comma_ ..un_comma_ adjective_comma_ conjunction .... and its morphologic catego e.g. masculine_comma_ singular_comma_ indicative .... .
E87-1006.txt,22,A possible approach to the problem is to store in a data base a list of all the declined forms for every lemma of the language_comma_ as well as their morphologic_comma_ syntactic and semantic characteristics.
E87-1006.txt,23,The size of such a list would be enormous_comma_ because a common dictionary contains about 50000 100000 lemmata and each lemma gives rise to several derived words and each word may be declined in different ways.
E87-1006.txt,24,Such a large data base is hard to enter and to update_comma_ and it is limited by the fixed size of its words list.
E87-1006.txt,25,In Italian_comma_ the creation of words is a generative proces hat follows several roles like_comma_ for instance HANO hand  verbalization  HAN EGGIARE to hand le  composition  PALLA MANO hand ball  olitlcization  RI MAN EGGIARE to re hand le In English_comma_ rules like composition or cliticization are not strictly morphologlc_comma_ because they often involve more than a word.
E87-1006.txt,26,In Italian_comma_ on the contrary_comma_ they modify the single word_comma_ producing new words like_comma_ for instance  alteration  CART ACCIA waste paper CARTA  composition  CARTA MONETA paper paper money  cliticization  IN CART ARE to wrap in paper These rules make the set of Italian words potentially unlimiled_comma_ and sometimes make insufficient even a common dictionary.
E87-1006.txt,27,A different approach takes two different lists one containing the lemmata of the language and the other the logic rules of derivations_comma_ from which all the correct Italian words can be produced starting from the lemmata.
E87-1006.txt,28,These rules can be easily described by means of a context free grammar_comma_ in which every word results from the concatenation of the stem of a lemma with alterations_comma_ affixes_comma_ endings and enelities.
E87-1006.txt,29,This grammar can both generate from a given lemma all the current Italian words deriving from it and analyze a given word by giving all the possible lemmata it derives from.
E87-1006.txt,30,The backtracking mechanism of Prolog directly allows to obtain all the solutions.
E87-1006.txt,31,This morphologic analyzer can also provide further information about some linguistic peculiarities_comma_ like_comma_ for instance compound names modal verbs altered names pelle rossa red skin _comma_ which has as plural peUi rosse. which take another verb as object 1 can go foglia leaf can be altered in fogli olina leaf let _comma_ whose meaning is piccola foglia small leaf .
E87-1006.txt,32,Data structure A correct morphologie analysis requires not only knowledgc on the language lemmata_comma_ but also on the word components as alterations_comma_ affixes_comma_ endings and enclitics.
E87-1006.txt,33,This information might hc represented in form of Prolog facts.
E87-1006.txt,34,In this way_comma_ data mighl be directly accessed by the program_comma_ because the homogeneity of their structure.
E87-1006.txt,35,The disadvantage is a performance degradation when the size of data increases_comma_ since Prolog is not provided with efficient search algorithms.
E87-1006.txt,36,Hence it seemed convenient to draw a distinction between data on one hand the set of lemmata_comma_ and on the other the sets of affixes_comma_ alterations_comma_ endings and enclitics.
E87-1006.txt,37,The former which is the most relevant and needs to be continuously updated _comma_ has been struclurcd as a relational data base table_comma_ managed by the SQI_comma_ DS.
E87-1006.txt,38,The advantage is that this system is directly accessible from VM Prolog the string containing the query is processed by SQI._comma_ which returns the answer as a Prolog list .
E87-1006.txt,39,The latter which have fixed lenghl and are not so large _comma_ have been stored in the Prolog workspace i_comma_ f_comma_ rm of Prolog facts.
E87-1006.txt,40,The set of lemmata is a table with five attributes 1. the fu st is the lemma.
E87-1006.txt,41,2. the second is the stem the invariable part of the lemma this is the access key in the table.
E87-1006.txt,42,3. the third is the name of the class of endings associated with every lemma.
E87-1006.txt,43,A class of endings is the set of all the endings related to a given class of words.
E87-1006.txt,44,For example_comma_ each of the regular verbs of the first conjugation has the same endings hence there exists a class named dv_leonjug containing all and only these endings.
E87-1006.txt,45,Generally each irregular verb is related to different classes of endings andare to go _comma_ for example_comma_ admits two different stems_comma_ vad go and and went so there exist two subclasses of endings named respectively dvl andare and dr2 andare.

The affixes can be divided in la eflxcs preceding the stem of the lemma_comma_ and suffixes following the stem of the lemma. The prefixes are simply listed by means of a one attribute table. In this way it is not necessary to list the prefixed words in the lexicon they are obtained by chaining the prefix with the original word. For example_comma_ from the verb to handle with the prefix re we obtain the verb to rehandle. Morphologlc and syntactic characteristics remain the same for the verbs only_comma_ the prefixed verb differs sometimes from the previous one in the syntactic atlribules transitive intransitive_comma_ simple modal .
E87-1006.txt,52,The set of suffixes is a table with four attributes I.
E87-1006.txt,55,4. the first is the suffix itself the second is the stem of the suffix the access key to the table the third is the ending class of the suffix the fourth is the syntactic class of the suffix.

This paper focuses on a problem formulation activity in a dialogue module which interacts on one side with an expert problem solver for financial investing and on the other side with a natural language front end.
E87-1031.txt,2,Several strategies which reflect specific aspects of person machine advice giving dialogues are realized by incorporating planning at a high level of dialogue. .
E87-1031.txt,3,As performances and scope of intelligent systems increase and the interaction of a system with a user gains in complexity_comma_ it becomes desirable to provide an easy initial access to a system for the novice user.
E87-1031.txt,4,Natural language is a medium presumably known by most users.
E87-1031.txt,5,For the system however_comma_ it not only requires understanding natural language utterances on a keyboard but also recogni .ing the intentions behind these utterances.
E87-1031.txt,6,It leads to a full fledged dialogue involving much reasoning at the pragmatic level of the communication process.
E87-1031.txt,7,The competence of most intelligent systems is usually bound to a restricted application domain and we can imagine that part of a dialogue is domain dependent while another is domain independent.
E87-1031.txt,8,Our efforts aim at designing a dialogue module making these different aspects explicit and interacting with other knowledge based agents.
E87-1031.txt,9,This work contributes to Esprit Project 816 EsteamX An architecture for distributed problem solving by cooperating data and knowledge bases.
E87-1031.txt,10,Advice giving systems for financial investment have been chosen as a first testbed application.
E87-1031.txt,11,This paper describes preliminary research on the dialogue module of such a system and the resulting prototype.
E87-1031.txt,12,An advice giving dialogue comprises three main activities_comma_ which may overlap l wblsm form_comma_dug on_comma_ where the various needs and capabilities of the user are elicited reso uh on_comma_ in which a possible solution to the problem is determined ezpla tion_comma_ which aims at convincing the user that IThe project is supported in part by the Commission of the European Communities the solution is in fact what she he needs.
E87-1031.txt,13,Our work concentrates on a problem formulation activity in a dialogue module which cooperates with a problem solver and a natural language front end.
E87-1031.txt,16,Computational Aspects Dialogue and communication theory are a broad field of studies drawing on several disciplines_comma_ among them philosophy_comma_ cognitive science_comma_ and artificial intelligence.
E87-1031.txt,17,The flurry of research devoted to these topics in recent years is largely enough to convince us we could not seriously hope to tackle the general problem.
E87-1031.txt,18,We have therefore limited our interest to person machine advice giving dialogue and we focus on two essential characteristics of this kind of dialogue the system has intentions and extensive knowledge about the domain which are a pr or unknown to the user the user s intentions must be interpreted in terms of the system s abilities or inabilities.
E87-1031.txt,19,We can see the first point as a manifestation of the expertness of the system_comma_ and the second as a manifestation of the Unoviceness of the user.
E87-1031.txt,20,We briefly recall some other research issues connected to our work and then elaborate on the specific aspects of person machine advice giving dialogue.
E87-1031.txt,22,Recognizing the illocutionary force of a speech act allows the system to reason about the intentions of the user and to behave accordingly.
E87-1031.txt,23,Most work in this field addresses only isolated speech acts or sometimes single utterances and is not concerned with a possible dialogue setting.
E87-1031.txt,26,These dialogues often produce patterns of the type question from the user requiring adequate answer from the system and seldom consider a possible initiative on the system s behalf.
E87-1031.txt,28,In person machine advice giving dialogue the challenge we face is how to make the expertise of the system accessible to the user in order to satisfy her his needs the expertness of the system and the novicenees of the user force a compromise between the system controlling the dialogue and the user expressing her himself freely.
E87-1031.txt,29,We chose to rely on the system for conducting the dialogue without however ignoring the initiative of the user_comma_ which is to be examined within the intentional framework of the system.
E87-1031.txt,30,In the course of our research_comma_ we have derived a few general strategies which typify our approach. Whenever possible_comma_ the system should set a clear background to the conversation.
E87-1031.txt,31,This is particularly true of the beginning of a session_comma_ where the system should not leave the user in the dark but should at once define its own competence and suggest possible options to the user.
E87-1031.txt,32,This initial setting will reflect the global purpose of the dialogue and its expected unfolding. Each step of a dialogue takes place in a certain context.
E87-1031.txt,33,We must ensure a common perception of this context by the user and the system if we want a meaningful exchange between them. s It is worth taking advantage of what the system can expect from the user when the latter takes the floor to guide the search of a correct interpretation and quickly decide the best suited reaction.
E87-1031.txt,34,We should make these expectations of the system apparent in our model of dialogue.
E87-1031.txt,35,Nevertheless_comma_ we want the system to allow for user digressions_comma_ such as the .
E87-1014.txt,1,. An automatic speech recognition system for Italian language has been developed at IBM Italy Scientific Center in Rome.

E87-1014.txt,14,Clearly_comma_ the availability of corpus on different topics could be very useful in order to use the language model in different contexts.
E87-1014.txt,15,Nevertheless_comma_ some studies demonstrate that language model could be still fruitfully used for a matter different to the main one_comma_ if the collected data are enriched with a small corpus about 1 2 the dimension of the main one related to the new subject.
E87-1014.txt,16,This technique is used to allow the recognition of sentences not on finance and economy.
E87-1014.txt,17,Figure 3 shows the coverage of the corpus on texts of economy and finance as a function of the vocabulary size.
E87-1014.txt,18,SEARCH STRATEGY To find the word sequence W which maximizes the term P WIA _comma_ it is not feasible to consider all the sequences that can be built with words in the dictionary.
E87-1014.txt,19,For this reason an efficient search strategy is used that limits the investigation to a small fraction of the allowed word strings.

E87-1041.txt,1,paper presents a format for representing the linguistic form of utterances_comma_ called situation schemata_comma_ which is rooted in the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry. A treatment of locative prepositional phrases is given_comma_ thus illustrating the generation of the situation schemata and their interpretation in situation semantics. .
E87-1041.txt,2,A natural language system aims to provide an overall framework for relating the linguistic form of utterances and their semantic interpretation.
E87-1041.txt,3,And the relation between the two must be algorithmic.
E87-1041.txt,4,In this paper we pursue an approach which is based on an algorithm for converting linguistic form to a format which we call a situation schema.
E87-1041.txt,5,A situation schema has a well def med formal structure_comma_ suggestive of logical form.
E87-1041.txt,6,This is a structure which is different from the standard modeltheoretic one we will argue that it is a structure better adapted for the analysis of the meaning relation in natural languages.
E87-1041.txt,7,A situation schema is effectively calculable from the linguistic form and we believe that it provides a format usefull for further processing_comma_ e.g. in the construction of a natural language interface with a data system and also in connection with mechanical translation systems.
E87-1041.txt,8,The general structure of situation schemata We begin by explaining the general structure of the situation schemata and how they_comma_ are rooted in the situation semantics of Barwise and Perry Barwise and Perry 83 .
E87-1041.txt,9,Situation semantics is grounded in a set of prinutives S situations R relations L locations D individuals The format of a bas c located fact is at I r_comma_ al_comma_..._comma_an 1 at 1 r_comma_ al ..... an 0_comma_ the first expresses that at the location 1 in L the relation r in R holds of the individuals al ..... an in D the second expresses that it does not hold.
E87-1041.txt,10,A s mat an s in S determines a set of facts of the form in s at l r_comma_ al ..... an 1 or in s at l r_comma_ al ..... an 0.
E87-1041.txt,11,We can think of a situation s as a kind of restricted_comma_ partial model data base which classifies certain basic facts.
E87-1041.txt,12,The set of primitives S_comma_L_comma_R_comma_D may come with some internal structure_comma_ e.g. the set L of locations is or represents connected regions of space time and thus could be endowed with a rich geometric structure.
E87-1041.txt,13,We shall see how this can be exploited in our analysis of locative prepositional phrases.
E87-1041.txt,14,A situaion schema is a complex feature value structure computable from the linguistic form of the utterance and with a choise of features matching the primitives of situation semantics REL ARG1 AEEm LOC .POL Here the features REL ARG1_comma_..._comma_ARGn_comma_ arid LOC correspond to the primitives relation_comma_ individuals_comma_ 258 location.
E87-1041.txt,15,POL_comma_ abbreviating polarity_comma_ takes either the value 1 or 0.
E87-1041.txt,16,The values in the schemata can either be atomic or complex feature value structures.
E87-1041.txt,17,The value of the LOC feature is always complex.
E87-1041.txt,18,The interpretation of a situation schema is relative to an utterance situation u and a described situation s.
E87-1041.txt,19,The utterence situation decomposes into two parts d discourse situation c the speaker s connections The discourse situation contains information about who the speaker is_comma_ who the addressee is_comma_ the sentence uttered_comma_ and the discourse location.
E87-1041.txt,20,The latter information is necessary to account for the tense of a sentence.
E87-1041.txt,21,The speaker s connections is a map determining the speaker s meaning of lexical items.
E87-1041.txt,22,The meaning of a sentence 1 is a relation between the utterance situation u d_comma_c and a described situation s.
E87-1041.txt,25,In other works_comma_ e.g.
E87-1041.txt,26,Fenstad et. al. 87 _comma_ we have developed the mathematical study of the structures S_comma_L_comma_R_comma_D in particular_comma_ several axiomatization theoremes have been proved_comma_ providing a complete inference mechanism for a multi sorted logic based on a semantics of partial information.
E87-1041.txt,27,Since the model theory of these sU uctures seems to be a natural formalism for a relational data base theory_comma_ it would be interesting to build a PROLOGstyle system based on the proof theory which we have developed.
E87-1041.txt,28,Oblique objects and adjuncts In the next section the general theory will be illustrated by the analysis of a couple of sentences that contain locative prepositional phrases.
E87-1041.txt,29,In this section we make some preliminary remarks.
E87-1041.txt,30,See Colban 85 or Fenstad eL al. 87 for more details.
E87-1041.txt,31,The PP s we consider here are all attached to a verb not a noun phrase _comma_ and will be divided into two classes oblique objects and adjuncts Kaplan and Bresnan 82 .
E87-1041.txt,32,An oblique object fills one of the argument slots of the verb if one considers the verb to be a relation with a fixed number of arguments.
E87-1041.txt,33,In e.g. the sentence Tom handed the book to Anne the verb handed is a ternary relation with arguments Torn_comma_ the book and_comma_ one migth say_comma_ Anne.
E87-1041.txt,34,However_comma_ we will consider the third argument to be something that has to be in the relation to to Anne.
E87-1041.txt,35,An oblique object is thus a constraint on an unexpressed argument of the verb.
E87-1041.txt,36,This way a verb may have several oblique objects without the number of arguments necessarely increasing.
E87-1041.txt,37,In the sentence Tom sent a letter from Norway to France both from Norway and to France are constraints on the same argument.
E87-1041.txt,38,Adjuncts function normally by restricting or modifying the relation expressed by the verb.
E87-1041.txt,39,Examples are Tom played with Anne and Tom ate in a hurry. Sometimes the location where the relation takes place is modified and not the relation itself.
E87-1041.txt,41,Tom ran to the car the location will be restricted to be in the relation to to the car.
E87-1041.txt,42,This relation will hold if the location is a curve Izacing the trajectory in space time that ends at the location of the car.
E87-1041.txt,43,The situation schemata in the examples below have been produced by a parser for LFG grammars.
E87-1041.txt,44,Usually_comma_ f structures are produced by such a parser_comma_ but we have written a grammar that causes situation schemata to be produced instead.
E87-1041.txt,45,Examples Examvle 1 1 Peter ran to the car.
E87-1041.txt,47,The values of the ARGi in the schemata can either be direct .
E87-1032.txt,1,problem solving systems must be able to express their results in a coherent and flexible manner. One way this can be done is by eztemporaneous elaboration_comma_ the method of language production that underlies more skilled tasks such as explanation.
E87-1032.txt,2,This paper outlines a computational model for extemporaneous elaboration that is implemented in a computer model called Extemper_comma_ shows examples of its operation_comma_ and compares it with other models of language production.
E87-1032.txt,3,Extemper contains the four components minimally required for elaboration 1 an efficient method for linearizing a knowledge structure_comma_ 2 a translation selection mechanism for producing a conceptual textbase from the knowledge structure_comma_ 3 local coherence operators which provide local connections between textbase elements_comma_ and 4 a conceptual generator to translate the coherent textbase into English. .
E87-1032.txt,4,An intelligent problem solving system may be required to participate in a purposive discourse with a user.
E87-1032.txt,5,Purposive discourse is dialogue where a welbdefined goal is pursued in a stereotyped and efficient but not inflexible way.
E87-1032.txt,6,Many common types of purposive discourse that could occur with an intelligent system_comma_ such as tutoring_comma_ explaining_comma_ and advising_comma_ require lengthy elaborations.
E87-1032.txt,7,Automated reasoners or problem solvers_comma_ in particular_comma_ are often required to explain_comma_ describe_comma_ or justify_comma_ that is_comma_ to elaborate on_comma_ their solutions.
E87-1032.txt,8,The process of producing unrehearsed and unedited expositions during purposive discourse is called ezternporaneous or spontaneous elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,9,This paper describes a computational model for extemporaneous elaboration implemented in a computer model called Extemper.
E87-1032.txt,10,The model consists of four components.
E87-1032.txt,11,The first is a linearizer which provides the overall structure of the elaboration by either a following a trace of the processing of a problem solver rehashing or_comma_ b directing a rehearsal of the knowledge used by the system i.e._comma_ instantinting the knowledge structures normally used for problem solving for use in language production .
E87-1032.txt,12,The second component is a set of selectors which determine what will be expressed based on considering the type of discourse_comma_ the discourse goals of the listener_comma_ and the relevance of domainspecific items.
E87-1032.txt,13,The linearizer and selectors produce the overall conceptual form of the elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,14,It is given a coherent linguistic form by the combination of local coherence operators_comma_ which examine conceptual forms to track focus_comma_ add connective words_comma_ etc._comma_ and a sentence generator Cullingford_comma_ 1986 which renders it in English.
E87-1032.txt,15,Extemper s core model of elaboration_comma_ then_comma_ consists of four components a linearizer_comma_ selectors_comma_ local coherence operators_comma_ and a sentence generator.
E87-1032.txt,16,These constitute a minimal cognitive architecture for elaboration minimal because more may be needed for other elaboration types e.g._comma_ a component to build and maintain a listener model for tutoring _comma_ and cognitive because components like these have been proposed by psychologists for models of language production e.g._comma_ vanDijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1083 .
E87-1032.txt,17,In the next section_comma_ I discuss how Extemper s components cooperate to produce an elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,18,In Section 3_comma_ I describe the type of domain that Extemper s minimal architecture is sufficient for descriptions of the operations of a problem solver.
E87-1032.txt,19,That section also distinguishes rehearsal from rehashing these are different ways of obtaining the knowledge to be elaborated.
E87-1032.txt,20,Before concluding_comma_ I compare Extemper with other systems designed for text and discourse production.
E87-1032.txt,21,Extemper A Computational Model Extemper implements a four component_comma_ minimal cognitive architecture for elaboration to produce descriptions of the behavior of problem solving systems.
E87-1032.txt,22,The problem solving systems it interacts with are a route planner and an academic counseling system.
E87-1032.txt,23,1 Extemper s linearizer_comma_ in cooperation with one of these problem solvers_comma_ provides a succession of pieces of the knowledge source being elaborated to translators.
E87-1032.txt,24,These meaning preserving translators produce conceptual forms which are linked into a conceptual knowledge base and then processed by the selectors.
E87-1032.txt,25,The output of both the translators and selectors is represented using a version of the Eclectic Representations for Knowledge Structures ERKS frame representation system developed by Cullingford 1986 .
E87-1032.txt,26,The concept selection cycle builds a single ERKS meaning structure until meaning structure ms functions determine that a newly selected concept does not fit with the current one.
E87-1032.txt,27,The ms functions use a heuristic evaluation of the connectedness of propositions to determine when to generate a sentence.
E87-1032.txt,28,They rely on the semantic classes of concepts and the goal structure represented in the conceptual knowledge base.
E87-1032.txt,29,For example_comma_ concepts representing simple actions taken by the route planner are considered to be connected_comma_ and can be expressed in a single sentence if they occur consecutively.
E87-1032.txt,30,Actions that contribute directly to the same goal are also considered to be connected.
E87-1032.txt,31,Note that there may also be syntactic constraints on what may fit into one sentence e.g._comma_ Derr and McKeown_comma_ 1984_comma_ describe how considerations of focus may force complex sentences to be generated but those constraints would not apply at this level_comma_ since the syntactic form the meaning structure will take is not yet known.
E87-1032.txt,32,After concept selection_comma_ the local coherence operators mediate between the conceptual form of the elaboration and its syntactic form by annotating meaning structures with instructions for the sentence generator.
E87-1032.txt,33,These instructions increase the connectedness or local coherence of the sentences to be generated given and new information_comma_ for example_comma_ is computed at this level.
E87-1032.txt,34,The annotated meaning structures are stored in a textbase whose elements are translated into English by the sentence generator.
E87-1032.txt,35,The sentence generator operates by repeatedly looking up words to span conceptual forms and ordering the words and those concepts that were not spanned according to predicates stored with the words.
E87-1032.txt,36,Additionally_comma_ there are conceptual sketchifiers that alter or delete information to express a concept more succinctly.
E87-1032.txt,37,Two important contributions can be found in this computational model for language production in addition to its description of the minimal components needed for 1Extemper and the problem solving systems are implemented in Frans Lisp on a Pyramid 90x. 191 elaboration .
E87-1032.txt,38,One contribution is illustrated by Extemper s use of the knowledge embodied in an intelligent system for guiding an elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,39,Extemper follows the principle that if a natural ordering exists for a body of knowledge_comma_ it should be used to guide extemporaneous elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,40,A natural ordering is one that corresponds to some common sense use of the knowledge_comma_ such as a problem solver might exhibit.
E87-1032.txt,41,Another contribution of this elaboration model is that it demonstrates that a language production mechanism can be designed to operate primarily on conceptual_comma_ language free forms.
E87-1032.txt,42,Manipulations are performed on the conceptual form of an elaboration_comma_ not the linguistic form.
E87-1032.txt,43,This is possible in Extemper because information from the problem solver is converted into conceptual form by the meaning preserving translators_comma_ and the selectors_comma_ local coherence operators_comma_ and sentence generator operate only on these forms.
E87-1032.txt,44,Use of a conceptual representation throughout the elaboration process makes possible a blurring of the distinction traditionally made in language production systems between what to say and how to say it. Linearizatlon and Translation When a topic is chosen for elaboration_comma_ the concepts to be communicated must be selected in an appropriate order.
E87-1032.txt,45,Extemper s linearizer is responsible for presenting pieces of a knowledge structure for selection in an order that is derived in some fashion from information inherent in the structure itself.
E87-1032.txt,46,To gain access to this ordering information_comma_ the linearizer must cooperate closely with the intelligent system that is producing or manipulating the knowledge.
E87-1032.txt,47,I discuss this further in Section 3 while describing the problem solving systems whose behavior Extemper describes.
E87-1032.txt,48,Orderings can be achieved in three general ways exploiting a given ordering_comma_ imposing an ordering_comma_ or deriving an ordering.
E87-1032.txt,49,In exploiting a given ordering_comma_ the connections already present in the knowledge structure are followed to find the next piece of information to say.
E87-1032.txt,50,An ordering must be imposed if the knowledge structure contains no ordering information or if a different ordering is desired.
E87-1032.txt,51,An imposed ordering is usually something that is known to be an effective means of ordering e.g._comma_ describing visual scenes by salience .
E87-1032.txt,52,Deriving an ordering must be done in cases where the underlying knowledge does not contain ordering information and such information would be expensive to compute and no imposed ordering exists that can achieve the goals of the elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,53,The strategy Extemper uses is to exploit the common sense ordering inherent in a knowledge structure.
E87-1032.txt,54,The principle that knowledge should be elaborated in a manner similar to the way it is used is based on the observation that complex transformations of knowledge are not found in naturally occuring elaborations_comma_ presumably because they are too time consuming to produce.
E87-1032.txt,55,However_comma_ even though Extemper uses a common sense ordering as the primary ordering method_comma_ it can be overcome by other factors such as pragmatic goals and listener input although this has not been done for any of the implemented examples .
E87-1032.txt,56,Also_comma_ the design of Extemper s lineariser does not preclude the use of imposed structures for elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,57,In such cases_comma_ the linearizer follows an external structure instead of the one internal to the knowledge structure used by the reasoner.
E87-1032.txt,58,This flexibility is possible because Extemper s linearizer is implemented as a set of agenda based tasks.
E87-1032.txt,59,Because these tasks are preemptable_comma_ so is the operation of the linearizer_comma_ in keeping with Extemper s eventual use in a discourse processing system.
E87-1032.txt,60,Exploiting a given ordering does not guarantee a complete ordering.
E87-1032.txt,61,A planner_comma_ for example_comma_ may arbitrarily choose which parts of a plan should be pursued first if the parts independently achieve a goal.
E87-1032.txt,62,The linearizer must_comma_ in these cases_comma_ decide what parts to express first.
E87-1032.txt,63,This is done using rules that choose among several possible next things to say.
E87-1032.txt,64,For example_comma_ in the route planning domain_comma_ a goal may be shown to be true simply by reasoning about it_comma_ for example_comma_ I am on Olden Street because I am in E Quad and E Quad is on Olden Street. and I assumed you were at Green Hall because you wanted me to meet you there. These two reasoning chains may together contribute to the satisfaction of a goal.
E87-1032.txt,65,Neither one takes precedence over another_comma_ so the linearizer uses a rule which prefers the shorter of the two the second one .
E87-1032.txt,66,Another rule_comma_ given several subgoals for a goal_comma_ will choose the ones that are supported by reasoning chains over ones that are supported by further planning.
E87-1032.txt,67,Supplementing the ordering produced by the problem solver with common sense rules like these gives a complete ordering of concepts for the selectors.
E87-1032.txt,68,Selection Relevance is an important constraint on discourse production.
E87-1032.txt,69,Constraints on relevance may be imposed by the overall type of discourse_comma_ pragmatic goals_comma_ and the characteristics of the domain knowledge.
E87-1032.txt,70,Determining if a given piece of knowledge is relevant is considerably more difficult than selecting a correct ordering for a knowledge structure.
E87-1032.txt,71,Techniques that have been explored include annotations on perceptual level representations of scenes to indicate visual salience Conklin_comma_ et.ai._comma_ 1983 _comma_ and databases containing multiple indexes keyed on user point of view McKeown_comma_ et.ai._comma_ 1985 .
E87-1032.txt,72,However_comma_ these techniques involve supplementing static knowledge bases and do not readily apply to selecting pertinent information from traces of a problem solver which Extemper needs for both rehearsal and rehashing .
E87-1032.txt,73,Instead_comma_ Extemper uses selectors that rely on different relevance factors to assist in determining relevance Uon the fly. The selectors that Extemper uses are rules constrained by the overall discourse goal of the listener.
E87-1032.txt,74,This enables Extemper to produce elaborations that are tailored to a particular goal this is the only global relevance factor used in the current implementation .
E87-1032.txt,75,The operation of the selectors is based on the ERKS method for representing meaning_comma_ namely that meaning representations consist of a kernel main or core concept and nuances ancillary concepts that distinguish similar meaning structures .
E87-1032.txt,76,For example_comma_ I drove to Green Hall. is distinguished from I traveled to Green Hall. by the nuance that_comma_ in the second case_comma_ the vehicle of transportation was a car.
E87-1032.txt,77,Decomposing meaning in this way allows meaning structures to be built piecewise by the selectors.
E87-1032.txt,78,Selectors can only perform actions that influence the conceptual content of ERKS meaning structures.
E87-1032.txt,79,They can be divided into three categories 1 those that select information for inclusion in a meaning structure_comma_ 2 those that modify the selected information_comma_ and 3 those that add ancillary information to meaning structures.
E87-1032.txt,80,For example_comma_ a selector for the route planner might choose to include a concept representing a goal restatement_comma_ e.g._comma_ I determined that I could meet you at Green Hall if you and I were there. Another selector depending upon the overall discourse goal the listener is presumed to have might choose to modify the concept to omit mention of how this conclusion was arrived at i.e._comma_ omit I determined that . A selector that adds ancillary information might produce introductory sentences like the following from the academic counseling domain There are four major requirements you must meet for Liberal Arts and Sciences. The selectors add concepts to one meaning structure until the next concept to be added no longer fits with the ones already selected.
E87-1032.txt,81,In this way_comma_ complex sentences are built from separate concepts.
E87-1032.txt,82,The separate concepts are connected according to the relationships found in the knowledge structure e.g._comma_ consecutive actions are joined with a temporal connective .
E87-1032.txt,83,Prior to sentence generation_comma_ however_comma_ more in192 formation must be added to the ERKS meaning structure.
E87-1032.txt,84,Local Coherence Operators The local coherence operators annotate ERKS meaning structures to create ties between successive parts of the elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,85,Based on examination of the conceptual forms in the current and previous meaning structures_comma_ they make decisions that may influence the syntactic form of the sentence.
E87-1032.txt,86,The most common one is the computation of given and new information_comma_ which affects focus.
E87-1032.txt,87,For example_comma_ in the route planning domain_comma_ if a sentence mentions walking to a place_comma_ that given location may be the focus for the next sentence.
E87-1032.txt,88,I walked to Green Hall.
E87-1032.txt,89,At Green Hall_comma_ I checked my mail.
E87-1032.txt,90,Another common operation is adding connective words_comma_ e.g._comma_ using Ok to signal the end of a description of how a goal may be achieved in the academic counseling domain.
E87-1032.txt,91,Local coherence operators are also used to provide certain default values for the meaning structure by filling annotation nuances.
E87-1032.txt,92,The most useful of these nuances are shorthand forms for full concepts that express specifications that are extrinsic to the meaning of the kernel concept absolute time_comma_ relative time_comma_ and modals.
E87-1032.txt,93,These nuances should be filled by the problem solver_comma_ but are not because the problem solvers used do not reason about time or modal information.
E87-1032.txt,94,The English sentence generator needs this information_comma_ so it has to be added in this ad hoc manner.
E87-1032.txt,95,The result of the first three parts_comma_ linearization_comma_ selection_comma_ and local coherence operations_comma_ is a set of generation instructions represented as a conceptual form consisting of a kernel and major nuance concepts plus annotations on it.
E87-1032.txt,96,This ERKS meaning representation is entered into a teztbase_comma_ a representation of the contents of the discourse.
E87-1032.txt,97,After being added to the textbase_comma_ the sentence generator produces English text from it in the manner described in Section 1.
E87-1032.txt,98,Further details on the sentence generator can be found in Cullingford 1986 .
E87-1032.txt,99,The Problem Solving Domain The emphasis in Extemper s design has been on modeling elaborations of the knowledge and behavior of goal directed problem solving systems.
E87-1032.txt,100,These problem solvers are typified by systems such as route planners or spatial reasoners.
E87-1032.txt,101,They are of interest because they solve commonplace problems_comma_ and their solutions can be described by commonplace hence extemporaneous elaborations.
E87-1032.txt,102,Two basic categories of elaborations are needed for problem solvers_comma_ and Extemper produces both kinds.
E87-1032.txt,103,One provides a reAasAing of something the problem solver has done from a trace of its execution.
E87-1032.txt,104,Rehashed elaborations say what was done to solve the problem_comma_ why it was done_comma_ and what the results were.
E87-1032.txt,105,The other type of elaboration uses the problem solver s knowledge base directly to elaborate on reAear6ed knowledge.
E87-1032.txt,106,The elaborator controls a rehearsal instead of following an execution trace by alternately rehearsing knowledge and elaborating on it.
E87-1032.txt,107,Here_comma_ rehearsing means fleshing out knowledge structures_comma_ e.g._comma_ by filling in the value of variables. Rehearsal is useful for providing information without the overhead of running the problem solver.
E87-1032.txt,108,Extemper serves as a first step for investigations into methods for producing a variety of elaborations.
E87-1032.txt,109,The problem solving elaborations it produces are descriptions of processes or actions based on the domains of route planning rehashed elaborations and academic counseling rehearsed elaborations .
E87-1032.txt,110,These two domains use very different types of knowledge_comma_ from rigid and script like the curriculum knowledge in the academic counseling domain to a mixture of goals_comma_ rules and plans the route planning knowledge .
E87-1032.txt,111,Extemper s ability to interpret these different types of domain knowledge demonstrates its flexibility.
E87-1032.txt,112,Table 1 shows a sample elaboration produced by Extemper.
E87-1032.txt,113,This description of the route planner s behavior is intended for an operator or programmer of the route planner_comma_ and is highly detailed.
E87-1032.txt,114,It gives the justifications underlying the route planner s actions and the mental states e.g._comma_ determined_comma_ a 6umed of the planner.
E87-1032.txt,115,Extemper also produces two less verbose elaborations from the same knowledge structure_comma_ based on different views of the discourse goal of the listener.
E87-1032.txt,116,One of them is shown in Table 2 the other is simply the last sentence in the elaboration shown in Table 2 .
E87-1032.txt,117,In the first_comma_ the listener is assumed to be unfamiliar with the area being described_comma_ in the second_comma_ a high degree of familiarity is assumed.
E87-1032.txt,118,The output lacks fluency because the focus of this work was not on sentence generation. Some improvement in the output could be gained from more work on sentence generation and pronominalization. I determined that I could meet you at GreenHall if you and I were there.
E87-1032.txt,119,I assumed you were at GreenHall because you wanted me to meet you there.

E87-1032.txt,134,Related Work The focus of much current research on language production is on text and discourse planning.
E87-1032.txt,135,Even though Extemper models an extemporaneous process_comma_ it must generate lengthy text like text production systems_comma_ and be as flexible as discourse planning models in interacting with a user.
E87-1032.txt,136,HELPCON a precursor of Extemper used the conceptual generator CGEN to generate instructions for s computeraided design system Cullingford_comma_ 1982 Bienkowski_comma_ 1983 .

E87-1032.txt,145,In similar work_comma_ Vaughan 1986 has proposed to use a plan and critique cycle to produce text.
E87-1032.txt,146,For modeling extemporaneous language production_comma_ however_comma_ critiquing is too time consuming_comma_ and more reliable planning mechanisms are needed.
E87-1032.txt,147,Discourse planning systems treat language as the result of execution of speech acts that are designed to affect another s beliefs or knowledge.
E87-1032.txt,148,These speech acts are planned by modeling their effects on a model of the other s beliefs and knowledge.
E87-1032.txt,149,Appelt 1082 _comma_ for example_comma_ views language production as one of several modaiities for a planner of actions.
E87-1032.txt,150,His planner_comma_ KAMP_comma_ explicitly manipulates assertions involving intensional concepts such as believe and know.
E87-1032.txt,151,IIlocutionary acts such as inform are axiom tired to capture the intentionality behind them this enables KAMP to reason about how it can realize its intentions.
E87-1032.txt,152,Extemper_comma_ like discourse planners_comma_ integrates the general knowledge an intelligent system has with its language behavior.
E87-1032.txt,153,Discourse planning methods_comma_ however_comma_ are not applicable to this work because planning an entire elaboration by reasoning about how to affect another s knowledge would overwhelm any planner.
E87-1032.txt,154,Also_comma_ reasoning about speech acts does not solve basic problems in elaboration production_comma_ since the main relevant speech act for elaboration is only inform. A planner_comma_ rather_comma_ would have to reason about how to achieve ordering_comma_ relevance and coherence goals in an elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,155,Previous planning systems_comma_ then_comma_ have operated on a different planning level than is needed for elaborators like Zxtemper.
E87-1032.txt,156,The alternative to planning from scratch methods is to use schemata or scripts for lengthy discourse production.
E87-1032.txt,157,While these certainly are part of an expert speaker s bag of tricks_comma_ there are several problems with relying on them exclusively for a process like elaboration.
E87-1032.txt,158,One problem is that some elaborations_comma_ such as those involving close interaction with a problem solver that is dynamically computing the knowledge structure to be elaborated_comma_ cannot be described by schemata.
E87-1032.txt,159,Another is that schema may not be needed for some tasks_comma_ if the knowledge structure is sufficiently wellstructured.
E87-1032.txt,160,Extemper does not offer a complete solution to either the problem of making elaboration as flexible as discourse or the problem of finding efficient ways to generate long texts.
E87-1032.txt,161,However_comma_ by making use of the knowledge that a problem solving system has_comma_ Extemper can guide an elaboration_comma_ and its reliance on a flexible task execution methodology described in Bienkowski_comma_ 1986 to do this leaves open the possibility that a method for reasoning about discourse goals can be added in future revisions.
E87-1032.txt,162,Summary and Conclusions Extemper s reliance on a reasoning system to guide its processing has been emphasized.
E87-1032.txt,163,In promoting a tight integration between language processing and reasoning components_comma_ this work is similar to the work on integrating parsing and memory described by Schank_comma_ 1980.
E87-1032.txt,164,Interfacing to a reasoning system requires a translation capability_comma_ however_comma_ so Extemper does not in general generate directly from the structures that the reasoner uses.
E87-1032.txt,165,But it cooperates closely enough so that_comma_ if the actions of the reasoner are regarded as the thoughts of the machine_comma_ Extemper serves as a window on those thoughts.
E87-1032.txt,166,Extemper relies entirely on conceptual forms throughout its processing cycle.
E87-1032.txt,167,The exclusive use of conceptual forms has been pushed as far as possible to see if the semantics or pragmatics of a sentence could justify its syntax. Sometimes this works other times_comma_ nothing in a conceptual form suggests why a particular syntactic form should be needed.
E87-1032.txt,168,This results in non fluent English.
E87-1032.txt,169,This is not to say that there is no reason for using the forms that could increase fluency_comma_ but that the reasons are to be found elsewhere.
E87-1032.txt,170,The work of McKeown 1985 on how tracking focus can affect syntactic structures_comma_ is an example of this.
E87-1032.txt,171,Extemper represents a minimal architecture for extemporaneous elaboration as purposive discourse.
E87-1032.txt,172,The four components it uses are necessary for any elaboration system.
E87-1032.txt,173,They are also sufficient for a certain class of knowledge sources.
E87-1032.txt,174,This work contributes to research on language production by both identifying extemporaneous elaboration as a naturalistic ability that is worthy of study_comma_ and by proposing a computational model for it.
E87-1021.txt,1,project of machine translation of Czech computer manuals into Russian is described_comma_ presenting first a description of the overall system structure and concentrating then mainly on input text preparation and a parsing algorithm based on bottom up parser programmed in Colmerauer s Q systems. . In mid 1985_comma_ a project of machine translation of Czech computer manuals into Russian was started_comma_ thus constituting a second MT project of the group of mathematical linguistics at Charles University for a full description of the first project_comma_ see Kirschner_comma_ 1982 and Kirschner_comma_ in press .
E87-1021.txt,2,Our goals are both practical translation or re translation of new or re edited manuals for export purposes within the COMECON countries_comma_ of an estimated amount of 500 to I000 pages a year and theoretical we wish to verify our approach to the analysis of Czech and to develop a theoretical background for translation between closely related languages such as Czech and Russian .
E87-1021.txt,3,The project is carried out by V S_comma_ Prague Research Institute for Computing Machinery at the Department of Software in cooperation with the Department of Mathematical Linguistics_comma_ Faculty of Mathematics and Physics_comma_ Charles University_comma_ Prague.
E87-1021.txt,4,Input texts The texts our system should translate are software manuals to V MS developed DOS 4 operating system which is an advanced extension to the common DOS.
E87-1021.txt,5,The texts are currently maintained on tapes under the editing and formatting system PES Programmed Editing System .
E87-1021.txt,6,This system allows for preparation_comma_ editing and binding ready printout using national printer chain s .
E87-1021.txt,7,Texts are stored on tapes using an internal format containing upper lowercase letters_comma_ editing formatting commands_comma_ version number identification_comma_ info on last changed pages etc. most of this can be used to improve the overall translation quality.
E87-1021.txt,8,On the other hand_comma_ part of it is somewhat confusing and must be handled carefully.
E87-1021.txt,9,By now_comma_ we have access to 65 manuals on tapes_comma_ containing about 12.000 pages approx. 1.500.000 running words 53.000 different word fomrs .
E87-1021.txt,10,The complete documentation covers 78 manuals and is still growing.
E87-1021.txt,11,113 The overall structure RUSLAN is a unidirectional system dealing with one pair of languages SL Czech_comma_ TL Russian .
E87-1021.txt,12,We adopt a transfer llke translation scheme in the sense we do not use any intermediate pilot language _comma_ but with many simplifications due to the close relationship between Czech and Russian_comma_ so that it belongs to the so called direct method in the sense of Slocum_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1021.txt,13,The translation process itself is to be carried out in batch we have to respect the hardware available .
E87-1021.txt,14,This means that no human intervention is possible during the process.
E87-1021.txt,15,Nevertheless_comma_ our aim is to obtain high quallty results which would require usual post editing only.
E87-1021.txt,16,No human pre editing is contained in the system design.
E87-1021.txt,17,The translation unit is constituted by a single sentence.
E87-1021.txt,18,Thus_comma_ the recognition of sentence boundaries is a part of the preprocessing.
E87-1021.txt,19,For the time being_comma_ a treatment of ellipsis is not provided for_comma_ but a modification of the analysis is being prepared to account for cases not very frequent in the translated manuals where information necessary for an appropriate translation should be looked for in the previous sentence s .
E87-1021.txt,20,Translation steps RUSLAN performs following steps to obtain the translation of a given part of a manual 1 The text is punched from a tape_comma_ to visualize all embedded editing formatting commands 2 Fully automatic preprocessing follows_comma_ which includes national special characters conversion coding sentence boundaries recognition 3 The Czech morphological analysis HA is performed_comma_ followed by 4 the syntactico semantic analysis SSA with respect to Russian sentence structure_comma_ for each input sentence separately.
E87-1021.txt,21,5 The representation obtained in the previous step is converted into Russian surface word llst in an appropriate order simultaneously performing some TL dependent changes.
E87-1021.txt,22,6 Then_comma_ morphological synthesis of Russian MSR is performed and at the same time synthesized words are decoded and put out along with preserved editing formatting commands_comma_ and at last 7 the output is saved onto a tape under the PES system again.
E87-1021.txt,23,The resulting text can be then easily printed and corrected using PES editing facilities.
E87-1021.txt,24,Some gore details Since the overall structure of RUSLAN does not differ considerably from the existing MT systems_comma_ we will concentrate ourselves in our paper on some interesting details. ad 1 Getting a text out of the tape This function is performed by means of PES punch command only.
E87-1021.txt,25,Internally 114 coded words and commands are converted to card like character format_comma_ so they can be read easily by other programs.
E87-1021.txt,26,This step is processed separatelly because we want to achieve the maximal hardware and operating syste independence possible. ad 2 Preproceaslng True words and punctuation are recognized and coded using alphanumeric characters only.
E87-1021.txt,27,Special characters such as _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ greek chars_comma_ etc. and YES commands are coded similarly_comma_ but they are handled as word attributes rather than as separate words.
E87-1021.txt,28,The recognition of sentence boundaries proved to be the hardest problem of this stage.
E87-1021.txt,29,We have developed a special algorithm for sentence boundaries recognition_comma_ which takes editing commands and punctuation into consideration_comma_ as well as upper lowercase letters in special positions.
E87-1021.txt,30,This algorithm is based on frames and features.
E87-1021.txt,31,Text is cut whenever the End Of Sentence condition is met.
E87-1021.txt,32,Such a condition is raised when one of the features of the next text element is found in the frame of the current text element.
E87-1021.txt,33,Features assigned to each element are e. g. beginning of sentence unconditional sentence boundary assigned to some PES commands_comma_ or capitalized this one is assigned to the word starting with exactly one uppercase letter.
E87-1021.txt,34,Among other features we use there are common word _comma_ uppercase only _comma_ number and some other classifying PES commands.
E87-1021.txt,35,Frames contain beginning of sentence in most cases a more complicated situation arises when evaluating punctuation frames.
E87-1021.txt,36,Frames for . _comma_ _comma_  are created using quite complicated algorithms.
E87-1021.txt,37,Clearly_comma_ it is not possible to obtain 100 correctness without a deeper analysis_comma_ so we prefer isolated missing cuts to incomplete sentences.
E87-1021.txt,38,Tests showed only one missing cut every 100 pages of continuous text introductory manuals _comma_ and every 30 50 pages in reference manuals no incomplete sentences appeared anywhere in the sample.
E87-1021.txt,39,This looks promising_comma_ because missing cuts result in slowdown of analysis only. ad S Morphological analysis Since Czech is a highly inflectional language_comma_ this part is a little more complicated task than a MA for English.
E87-1021.txt,40,However_comma_ in the stage of MA of Czech we obtain much more useful information for the syntactico semantic analysis.
E87-1021.txt,41,MA is based on pattern unification.
E87-1021.txt,42,During the MA_comma_ the main dictionary is searched through to find all possible stems ambiguities are treated in parallel during the next phase of processing. ad 4 Syntactico semantic analysis SSA is the most important part of RUSLAN.
E87-1021.txt,43,Using Sgall s FGD as the theoretical starting point for the most recent formulation_comma_ see Sgall et al._comma_ 1986 _comma_ the dependency approach and data driven parsing are the corner stones and valency frames are the tools of SSA.
E87-1021.txt,44,To control the combinatoric expansion_comma_ semantic features are used as additional constraints to the syntactic ones for a more detailed account of 115 SSA_comma_ see Oliva_comma_ in prep. .
E87-1021.txt,45,The result of SSA is affected by the TL syntax so there is no true separate transfer component in our system.
E87-1021.txt,46,In most cases_comma_ the need for changes can be resolved on the basis of the Czec sentence.
E87-1021.txt,47,A module is being prepared carrying out some minor restructuring necessary e. g. for determining the word order and some instances of negation _comma_ which will be performed before the synthesis.
E87-1021.txt,48,The close relationship between Czech and Russian helps us to leave many ambiguities unresolved and to allow the output to be as ambiguous as the input.
E87-1021.txt,49,We must resolve such ambiguities that would create multiple outputs in the TL_comma_ and select only one of them_comma_ but this is the case of only limited number of sentences. ad 5 Generation For the time being_comma_ no true TL restructuring is being performed.
E87-1021.txt,50,During the dependency tree decomposition_comma_ morphological information is transferred from the governor to its dependent modifications according to agreement.
E87-1021.txt,51,The original word order is slightly changed when needed.
E87-1021.txt,52,An ordered list of words with morphological information and editing formatting attributes restored is the output of this phase. ad 6 Morphological synthesis True words are processed by the MSR module to obtain their inflected forms.
E87-1021.txt,53,This module is capable of doing some word derivation such as verbal adjectives .
E87-1021.txt,54,It is also responsible for orthographical changes concerning prepositions and some pronouns forced by the adjacent word s .
E87-1021.txt,55,After MSR_comma_ each word is decoded including its attributes to the FEB acceptable format and punched out.
E87-1021.txt,56,This is an inverse operation to step 2 . ad 7 Catalogization Handled by YES solely_comma_ this is an inverse operation to step 1 .
E87-1021.txt,57,Implementation All the testing is performed on the EC 1027 or IBM 370 systems at V MS under DOS 4 .
E87-1021.txt,58,The base of the system steps 3_comma_ 4 and 5 is capable to run under the OS operating system as well.
E87-1021.txt,59,Steps 1 and 7 are handled by special software_comma_ which is a part of the DOS 4 operating system.
E87-1021.txt,60,Steps 2 and 8 are written in standard Pascal including the MSR module .
E87-1021.txt,61,Steps 3 to 5 are programmed in the well known Q systems_comma_ implemented through Fortran IV G or H level .
E87-1021.txt,62,We use the Q language compiler with the kind permission of its original author_comma_ prof. B.
E87-1021.txt,63,Thouin some marginal changes were made in the Q language interpreter due to the practical needs of our system.
E87-1021.txt,64,The only noticeable change is that complete graphs deleted formerly due to the CUL DE SAC mechanism are passed now unchanged to the next Q system for further processing.
E87-1021.txt,65,Maximal core requirement is estimated to 840KB step 3 dictionary _comma_ so it is possible to use even real memory based systems.
E87-1021.txt,66,Secondary storage volume will be determined mainly by the dictionary 116 size_comma_ since an average entry occupies i000 bytes for the first operational version.
E87-1021.txt,67,We suppose that i0.000 entries will be sufficient for the first prototype.
E87-1021.txt,68,Dictionary search is performed using extended hashing scheme incorporated in the Q language interpreter.
E87-1021.txt,69,Elapsed time needed for translation depends on hardware and the time sharing coefficient.
E87-1021.txt,70,First test showed_comma_ that the widely published speed of 1.5 mipw will not be exceeded.
E87-1021.txt,71,This converts to 3 sec CPU on our fastest EC I027 computer_comma_ which will clearly suffice to translate up to the desired 50 pages a day.
E87-1021.txt,72,Conclusion In March 1987_comma_ steps I_comma_ 2_comma_ 3 and 7 are fully developed and implemented_comma_ step 8 is implemented partially morphological synthesis of Russian it will be finished in mid 87.
E87-1021.txt,73,Steps 4 and 5 are under development.
E87-1021.txt,74,They have been separately tested since last summer_comma_ the manual on General Description of DOS 4 being the testing material.
E87-1021.txt,75,Translation of the first three pages is available now performed by steps 3_comma_ 4 and 5 .
E87-1021.txt,76,Simultaneously_comma_ dictionary entries cca 7500 for the first_comma_ 87 version are being prepared by external co workers. .
E87-1015.txt,1,our institute a speech understanding and dialog system is developed. As an example we model an information system for timetables and other information about intercity trains.
E87-1015.txt,2,In understanding spoken utterances_comma_ additional problems arise due to pronunciation variabilities and vagueness of the word recognition process.
E87-1015.txt,3,Experiments so far have also shown that the syntactical analysis produces a lot more hypotheses instead of reducing the number of word hypotheses.
E87-1015.txt,4,The reason for that is the possibility o combining nearly every group of word hypotheses which are adjacent with respect to the speech signal to a syntactically correct constituent.
E87-1015.txt,5,Also_comma_ the domain independent semantic analysis cannot be used for filtering_comma_ because a syntactic sentence hypothesis normally can be interp.reted in several different ways_comma_ respectively a set of syntactic hypotheses for constituents can be combined to a lot of semantically interpretible sentences.
E87-1015.txt,6,Because of this combinatorial explcaiun it seems to be reasonable to introduce domain dependent and contextual knowledge as early as possible_comma_ also for the semantic analysis.
E87-1015.txt,7,On the other hand it would be more efficient prior to the whole semantic interpretation of each syntactic hypothesis or combination of syntactic hypotheses to find possible candidates with less effort and interpret only the more probable Ones.
E87-1015.txt,9,In the speech understanding and dialog system EVAR Niemann et al. 1985 developed at our institute there are four different modules for understanding an utterance of the user Brietzmaun 1984 the syntactic analysis_comma_ the task independent semantic analysis_comma_ the domain dependent pcagmatic analysis_comma_ and another module for dialog specific aspects.
E87-1015.txt,10,The semantic module disregards nearly all of the thematic and situational context.
E87-1015.txt,11,Only isolated utterances are analyzed.
E87-1015.txt,12,So the main points of interests are the semantic consistency of words and the underlying relational structure of the sentence.
E87-1015.txt,13,The analysis of the functional relations is based on the valency and case theory Tesniero 1966_comma_ Fillmore 1967 .
E87-1015.txt,14,In this theory the head verb of the sentence determines how many noun groups or prel csitional groups are needed for building up a syntactically correct and semantically consistent sentence.
E87-1015.txt,15,For these slots in a verb frame further syntactic and semantic restrictions can also be given.
E87-1015.txt,17,Semtntic and Progmstic Consistency Semantic Consistency The semantic knowledge of the module consists of lexical meanings of words and selectional restrictior between them.
E87-1015.txt,18,These restrictions are possible for a special word_comma_ fur example the preposition nach to Hamburg requires a noun with the meamng LOCation.
E87-1015.txt,19,In the case of a frame they are for a whole constituent for example_comma_ the verb wchnen to live in Hamburg needs a preposition l group also with the me ning LOCation.
E87-1015.txt,20,The selectional restrictions are expressed in the dictionary by the feature SELECTION.
E87-1015.txt,21,The semantic classes features are hierarchically organized in a way_comma_ so that all subclasses of a class also are accepted as compatible.
E87-1015.txt,22,For example_comma_ if a word with the semantic class CONcrete is required_comma_ also a word with the class ANimate a subclass of CONcrete or with the class HUman a subclass of ANimate is accepted.
E87-1015.txt,24,For each prepo tiun or adjective there can be determined with which nouns they could be combined.
E87-1015.txt,25,That is done by selecting the semantic class of the head noun of a noun group or prepositional group.
E87-1015.txt,26,For example in in its temporal meaning can be used with nouns as Fig. 2 shows_comma_ how this system could be used to solve ambiguities.
E87-1015.txt,27,84 For example coach coach.l.l . railway carriage CLAS TRAnsport_comma_ LOCation coach.l.2 privat tutor_comma_ trainer in athletics CLASS ACtingPerson in in.l.l in the evening CLASS DURation SELECTION TIMe in.l.2 in the room CLASS PLAce SELECTION LOCation Fig. 2 Semantic Interpretation of in the coech Although there are 4 possibilities for combining the words in their different meanings only one possibility in.l.2 I coach.l.l is semantic consistent.
E87-1015.txt,28,At this time no sooting is provided for how compatible a group of words is_comma_ only if it is semantically consistent or not.
E87-1015.txt,29,Pragmatic Consistency Because of the above mentioned combinatorial explosion it seems to be useful to integrate also at this task independent stage of the analysis some domain dependent information.
E87-1015.txt,30,This pragmatic inforn tion should be handled with as few effort as possible.
E87-1015.txt,31,On the other side the effect as a filter should also be as good as possible.
E87-1015.txt,32,What is not intended is to introduce here a first structural analysis but to decide whether a group of words pragmatically fit together or not_comma_ only dependent on special features of the words itself.
E87-1015.txt,33,For this reason here it is tried to check the pragmatic consistency of groups of words or constituents and give them a pragmatic priority.
E87-1015.txt,34,This priority is not a measure for correctness of the hypothesis_comma_ but determines in which order pragmatically checked hypotheses should be further analyzed.
E87-1015.txt,35,It indicates_comma_ whether all words of such a group can be interpreted in the same pragmatic concept_comma_ and how much the set of possible pragmatic concepts could be restricted.
E87-1015.txt,36,In our system the pragmatic task specific knowledge is represented in a semantic network Brielzmarm 1984 as is the knowledge of the semantic module.
E87-1015.txt,37,The network scheme is influenced by the formalism of Stuetured Inheritance Networks Brachman 1978 .
E87-1015.txt,38,In this pragmatic network at the time six types of information inquiries are modelled.
E87-1015.txt,39,Each of these concepts for an inforrmtion type has as attributes the information that is needed to find an answer for an inquiry of the user.
E87-1015.txt,40,For example_comma_ the concept timetable information has an attribute From time which specifies the range of time during which the departure of the train should be see Fig. 3 .
E87-1015.txt,42,It is even possible to predict a set of nuclei.
E87-1015.txt,43,These could he used as top down hypotheses for the syntax module or the word recognition module.
E87-1015.txt,44,For example for to leave INSTRUMENT NG Tra GOAL  PNG Loc OBJECT  NG Con The combinations are then NG Tra NG Tra PNG Loe NG Tra NG Con NG Tra PNG Loe NG Con PNG Loe NG Con These combinations do not say anything about sequential order_comma_ for_comma_ in German_comma_ word order is relatively free.
E87-1015.txt,45,The last possibility is regarded although such a sentence would he grammatically incomplete the I UMENT slot is obligatory to cope with the fact that not all uttered words are recognized by the word recognition module.
E87-1015.txt,46,To reduce the number of combinations the second combination will be eliminated because the class TRAnsport is a specialization of CONcrete see Fig. 1 and the combination is then also represented by the last possibility.
E87-1015.txt,47,So there arise ambiguities that have to be solved in the last step of the analysis_comma_ the instantiation of frames.
E87-1015.txt,48,If this method is applied to a dictionary that cont in all of the words used in the above example the result is the following list of combinations instead of 14 possibilities_comma_ if nothing is drawn together NG Con  go_comma_ cost_comma_ leave NG Abs  cost_comma_ there._is PNG Loe  ticket_comma_ train_comma_ go PNG Loe NG Con  go_comma_ leave PNG Loe NG Tra NG Lo  leave NG Wor Ng Thi  cost During the first stage of the analysis the serramtic consistent constituents are sorted to the above used classes see Fig. 9 so that a constituent is attached to all classes with which it is semantically compatible and agrees with respect to the constituent type.
E87-1015.txt,49,So the problem of finding instances for the above combinations reduces to combining each element of the set of hypotheses attached to one class to each element of the set of hypotheses attached to the second class of the combination_comma_ and so on.
E87-1015.txt,50,If one combination comprises another_comma_ for example PNG Lcx and PNG Loe NGCon _comma_ the earlier result is used the seek is organized as a tree .
E87-1015.txt,51,Restrictions for combining are given by the fact that two hypotheses cannot he competing with regard to the speech signal and by the fact that the found group of words has to he pragmatically consistent.
E87-1015.txt,52,To complete these groups there is also tried to f md temporal adjuncts to each of them out of the original group and the so found new groups only the best will be furthermore treated as hypotheses .
E87-1015.txt,53,As temporal adjuncts there will be used all constituents which are compatibal with the semantic class l INte and chains of such constituents with length of not more than 3 for example tomorrow I morning _comma_ tomorrow I morning I at 9 o clock .
E87-1015.txt,54,Up to now no more inforn ation is used but in the future there will be a module that chooses only in the dialog context interpretable chains of temporal adjuncts.
E87-1015.txt,55,With this second step of semantic analysis in Fig. 8 all sentences but 3_comma_ 11 and 18 are hypothesized.
E87-1015.txt,56,3 and 17 are rejected because the constituent type is not correct_comma_ 11 is not pragmatically compatibal.
E87-1015.txt,57,All sententces in Fig. 8 satisfy the semantic restrictions.
E87-1015.txt,58,There have been made also experiments that consider in addition simple rules of word order.
E87-1015.txt,59,They cannot he very specific because in German nearly each word order is allowed_comma_ especially in spoken 88 NG Abs NG Con NG l.xx NG Thi NG Tra what a connection a first class coach what the next train I Hamburg a ticket what Hamburg a first class coach what the next train a ticket a first class coach NG Wor PNG Loc what what the next train to Hamburg for Hamburg Fig. 9 .
E87-1015.txt,60,Constituents sorted to actant classes speech.
E87-1015.txt,61,But nethertheless the experiments so far indicate that about a third of all groups are rejecmd with this criterion for example the sentence 15 in Fig. 8 .
E87-1015.txt,62,All found groups of hypotheses get the above mentioned scores and are ordered with regard to it.
E87-1015.txt,63,Results The results here presented are based on the following utterances for the conditions of the experiments see also section 4.1 246a Welche Verbindung kann ich nelmmn
E87-1015.txt,64,Which connection should I choose 246b Hat dieser Zug auch einen Speisewagen
E87-1015.txt,65,Has this train also a dining car 0250 Ich moechte am Freitng moeglichst frueh in Bonn sein.
E87-1015.txt,66,I want to be at Bonn on Friday as early as possible. 5518 Er kostet z.elm Mark.
E87-1015.txt,67,It costs ten marks .
E87-1015.txt,68,5520 Wit mcechten am Wochenende nach Mainz fahren.
E87-1015.txt,69,We want to go to Mainz at the weekend. Fig. 10 shows how many groups Of hypotheses were found dependent on the number of word hypotheses per segment in the speech signal each segment represents one phon .
E87-1015.txt,70,The experiments here have been made by using as restrictions for the combinations Legend 1 without pbv ...with pbv .. word order o00 1 I00 1. the semantic classes and the type of the constituents without pbv 2. the semantic classes_comma_ the type of the constituents and pragmatic attributes using the pragmatic bitvectors with pbv 3. the same conditions as in 2._comma_ but in addition some word order restrictions are checked word order .
E87-1015.txt,71,The really spoken utterances are always found but in soma cases with a very bad score with respect to competing hypotheses.
E87-1015.txt,72,The main reasons for this result and the often high number of hypotheses are The analysis of the time adjuncts is too less restrictive.
E87-1015.txt,73,Therefore in the future there will be only used constituents or chains of constituents that can really be interpreted in the dialog context as a time intervall or a special moment.
E87-1015.txt,74,So hypotheses as yesterday I then I tommorow or at nine o clock I next year no longer are accepted.
E87-1015.txt,75,The referred tirae should also lie in the near future because of our application . Anaphora could fill nearly each slot in each frame similar as the constituent what in Fig. 9 .
E87-1015.txt,76,On the other hand they are often very short.
E87-1015.txt,77,So they appear in many combinations with other constituents.
E87-1015.txt,78,For an anaphoric constituent must have a referent which it represents for example the constituent it in 5518 could possibly refer to ticket _comma_ such constituents should I0 I _comma_ I I I 1.5 2 2. 3 3.5 4 4 5.5 8.5 Fig. 10 Results of the pre selection 89 obtain the semantic and pragmatic attributes of the possible referents or_comma_ if there are none_comma_ should not be regarded for future analysis.
E87-1015.txt,79,This method will first reduce the number of hypotheses and second will improve the score of a sentence with anaphoric constituents if it was really spoken or also if it is well interpretable .
E87-1015.txt,80,4.3 Structural Interpretation The last step consists in trying to instantiate the found candidates in the semantic network of the module Briel2mann 1984 and 1986 .
E87-1015.txt,81,Here all other selectionfl restrictions i.e. especially the syntactic ones are checked and thus the amount of hypotheses can be reduced a little bit more.
E87-1015.txt,82,Also the ambiguities have to be solved see above .
E87-1015.txt,83,As a result there are gained instances of frame concepts which are the input for further domain dependent analysis by the pragmatic module.
E87-1015.txt,84,This step the instantiation now is in work.
E87-1015.txt,85,All others are runnable.
E87-1015.txt,87,Conclusion In this paper a semantic analysis for spoken speech is presented.
E87-1015.txt,88,The most important additional problem which arises in comparison to a written input is the combinatorial explosion due to the many word hypotheses produced by the word recognition module.
E87-1015.txt,89,Because of this problem one has to cope with many word ambiguities.
E87-1015.txt,90,For solving these problems we need scores.
E87-1015.txt,91,Problems arise with time adjuncts and anaphora.
E87-1015.txt,92,Also hierarchically structured sentences cannot be analyzed with the method of pre selection of groups_comma_ for exampl Could you please look for the best connection to Hamburg could look J J I J you for the best connection I I to Hamburg Until now two combinations are found but they have bad scores because they cover too 1 of the speech signal.
E87-1015.txt,93,They cannot be combined together.
E87-1015.txt,94,Could I you I look I for the best connection and for the best connection I to Hamburg It is planned to expand the pre selection in a way that also this problem could be solved.
E87-1015.txt,95,The semantic analysis is implemented in LISP at a VAX 11 730. .
E87-1039.txt,1,information systems specifications from natural language description is presented as a problem class that requires a different treatment of semantics when compared with other applied NL systems such as database and operating system interfaces. Within this problem class_comma_ the specific task of obtaining explicit conceptual data models from natural language text or dialogue is being investigated.
E87-1039.txt,2,The knowledge brought to bear on this task is classified into syntactic_comma_ semantic and systems analysis knowledge.
E87-1039.txt,3,Investigations with a simple syntactic parse and with a semantic analysis using McCorcl s Slot Grammar are reported_comma_ and the structure of the systems analysis knowledge is considered.
E87-1039.txt,5,This section introduces the application of computer based tools for information systems requirements analysis_comma_ design. and implementation_comma_ and outlines a motivation for endowing such tools with natural language interfaces.
E87-1039.txt,6,It concludes with the structure of the remainder of the paper.
E87-1039.txt,7,Information systems development suffers from two widely acknowledged problems an applications backlog_comma_ whereby demand for applications exceeds resources available for its satisfaction. a requirements analysis problem.
E87-1039.txt,8,This is often manifested as a maintenance problem_comma_ whereby resources that could be put into reducing the applications backlog are instead devoted to correcting faults in delivered systems.
E87-1039.txt,9,Most such faults are traceable to erroneous specifications_comma_ resulting from a failure to establish user requirements correctly.
E87-1039.txt,10,The industry has provided solutions to each of these problems The problem of productivity has been addressed by the provision of more powerful higher level languages known as application generators or fourth generation languages 4GLs _comma_ in which the same functionality can be achieved in a tenth or less of the instructions needed in a conventional procedural computer language.
E87-1039.txt,11,A general feature of such software tools is that they do away with the need for much procedural programming by employing declarative notations in which requirements can be expressed in sufficient detail for the software to provide procedures to meet them.
E87-1039.txt,12,Naturally_comma_ the sophistication of these declarative notations varies according to the breadth of their application coverage. The requirements analysis problem has been addressed since the mid nineteen seventies by a range of prescriptive development methods providing working procedures and graphical representation languages_comma_ in place of traditional approaches which rely heavily on natural language narrative to specify prooessing requirements.
E87-1039.txt,13,A typical representation or conceptual modelling language is described in section 2.
E87-1039.txt,14,A problem with both the high level application generators and the development methods is that they have been established independently by a variety of manufacturers_comma_ software houses_comma_ consultants and academics_comma_ resulting in a multitude of competing products and methods_comma_ with no standard accepted by the industry.
E87-1039.txt,15,Suppliers and users therefore face considerable training and consultancy costs due to staff mobility.
E87-1039.txt,16,A more recent trend is to combine the two approaches to produce a more powerful software tool environment or analyst s workbench which enables the analyst to edit diagrams that formally represent the requirements_comma_ and using these specifications to automatically generate computer programs.
E87-1039.txt,17,Such tools represent an improvement on previous practice in two ways firstly by bringing forward the use of precise formal languages from the coding to the specification phase in the software life cycle_comma_ and secondly by automating the coding phase.
E87-1039.txt,18,However_comma_ they do not similarly automate the analysis phase that must precede the formal expression of requirements in a specification_comma_ although they may mechanize the process of recording and revising a specification.
E87-1039.txt,19,The nature of such tools is described in section 3.
E87-1039.txt,20,It is proposed that a natural language interface to tools provided to mechanize such methods would provide several benefits It is possible to develop a specification using a representation language with which the analyst is not 241 familiar_comma_ by hiding the representation language from the analyst.
E87-1039.txt,21,It can alternatively help the analyst learn the specification language by displaying the graphical representation of a given description.
E87-1039.txt,22,With a natural language generation facility it is possible for an analyst to informally verify that a graphical representation of some aspect of a system expresses the desired meaning.
E87-1039.txt,23,A natural language generator can be used to translate a specification developed by someone else using a representation that the reader is not familiar with.
E87-1039.txt,24,In addition to facilitating communication between analysts ained on different methods_comma_ this technique could facilitate communication between analysts and their users or expert informants.
E87-1039.txt,25,A further motivation is that increasingly_comma_ the 4GLs described above are in the hands of end users who develop applications directly.
E87-1039.txt,26,4GLs typically make straightforward applications easy to develop_comma_ often prompting the users for the parameters that specialize the application as an instance of the stereotype systems that lie within the tool s application bandwidth.
E87-1039.txt,27,However_comma_ they are often poor at enabling more elaborate requirements to be met where there are interdependencies between data Ides and complex integrity and validation rules.
E87-1039.txt,28,A tool built on the lines described below cart help end users inexpert in analysis to articulate their own requirements and then to convert those requirements into executable code.
E87-1039.txt,29,The architecture of an information systems development workbench with an integrated natural language and graphics interface is described in section 4.
E87-1039.txt,30,An approach to knowledge representation within this system is discussed in section 5.
E87-1039.txt,31,Approaches to natural language analysis and generation and the results of some prototyping work are discussed in section 6.
E87-1039.txt,32,Conceptual Data Models Within system development methods_comma_ there exist several notations for the representation of aspects of the information processing systems.
E87-1039.txt,33,A comprehensive method will be able to represent a conceptual model of the real and .
E87-1022.txt,1,paper discusses a recent extension of the linguistic framework of the Rosetta system. The original framework is elegant and has proved its value in practice_comma_ but it also has a number of deficiencies_comma_ of which the most salient is the impossibility to assign an explicit structure to the grammars.
E87-1022.txt,2,This may cause problems_comma_ especially in a situation where large grammars have to be written by a group of people.
E87-1022.txt,3,The newly developed framework enables us to divide a grammar into subgrammars in a linguistically motivated way and to control explicitly the application of rules in a subgrammar.
E87-1022.txt,4,On the other hand it enables us to divide the set of grammar rules into rule classes in such a way that we get hold of the more difficult translation relations.
E87-1022.txt,5,The use of both these divisions naturally leads to a highly modular structure of the system_comma_ which helps in controlling its complexity.
E87-1022.txt,6,We will show that these divisions also give insight into a class of difficult translation problems in which there is a mismatch of categories.
E87-1022.txt,7,1 The Rosetta Framework In this section we will give an outline of the approach to machine translation pursued in the Rosetta project_comma_ which takes place at Philips Research Laboratories.
E87-1022.txt,8,The linguistic framework of Rosetta can be characterized by a number of principles.
E87-1022.txt,9,These are working principles _comma_ intended to be helpful for systematic research on translation and for the actual construction of translation systems.
E87-1022.txt,10,The principles are discussed here to the extent in which they are relevant to this paper. rhis paper is the merger of two complementary papers on the Rosetta translation system that were submitted to the European ACL Conference 1987_comma_ i.e.
E87-1022.txt,11,Subgrammars and Rule Classes in the Rosetta Translation System by Appelo and Fellinger and Controlled M Grammars in the Rosetta System by Landsbergen.
E87-1022.txt,12,This research was partially sponsered by Nehem Nederlandse Herst ruct ureringsmaatschappij .
E87-1022.txt,13,Principle of Explicit Grammars There is an explicit grammar for both the source and the target language.
E87-1022.txt,14,In most translation systems the target language is defined indirectly by means of contrastive transfer rules that specify the differences with the source language.
E87-1022.txt,15,We think it important to have an independent criterion for correctness of the target text.
E87-1022.txt,16,Compositionalit Principle. The meaning of an expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the way in which they are syntactically combined.
E87-1022.txt,17,This principle was adopted from Montague Grammar cf. Thomason_comma_ 1974 .
E87-1022.txt,18,Obviously_comma_ this principle will lead to an organlsation of the syntax that is strongly i nfiuenced by semantic considerations.
E87-1022.txt,19,But as it is an important criterion of a correct translation that it is meaning preserving_comma_ this seems to be a useful guideline in machine translation.
E87-1022.txt,20,The compositional grammars of Rosetta_comma_ called M grammars_comma_ consist of three components a syntactic_comma_ a semantic and a morphological component.
E87-1022.txt,21,The syntactic component defines surface trees of sentences.
E87-1022.txt,22,The surface trees used in Rosetta_comma_ called S trees_comma_ are ordered trees of which the nodes are labelled with syntactic categories and attribute value pairs that bear other morphosyntactic information.
E87-1022.txt,23,The branches are labelled with syntactic relations.
E87-1022.txt,24,S trees are used as intermediate representations as well.
E87-1022.txt,25,The syntactic component defines the set of correct S trees by specifying 1. a set of basic expressions.
E87-1022.txt,26,2. a set of compositional syntactic rules.
E87-1022.txt,27,These rules make it possible to derive new S trees and ultimately surface trees of sentences from the basic expressions.
E87-1022.txt,28,The rules have transforms. tional power _comma_ they may perform various operations on S trees.
E87-1022.txt,29,The process of deriving a surface 118 tree starting from basic expressions by applying syntactic rules recursively_comma_ in a bottom up way_comma_ can be represented in a syntactic derivation tree with the basic expressions at the terminals and the names of the applied rules at the nonterminals.
E87-1022.txt,30,With each node of the derivation tree an intermediate resulting S tree can be associated_comma_ i.e. the S tree that is the result of the application of the rule of that node on the resulting S trees of its daughters see figure I . the donkey is eating applesthe donkey the donkey eat apples donkey R_comma_ eat zl z2 R4 Ra R2 zt eat apples apples apple Figure I syntactic derivation tree_comma_ the derived S trees are paraphrased by strings The leaves of a complete surface tree correspond to the words of the sentence_comma_ but they have the form of categories and attribute value pairs.
E87-1022.txt,31,The morphological component relates these leaves to actual symbol strings.
E87-1022.txt,32,In this paper we will ignore this morphological component and the Strees will be paraphrased by strings most of the time to enhance the readability of these trees.
E87-1022.txt,33,The M grammars have a semantic component that specifies 1. the meaning of the basic expressions basic meanings .
E87-1022.txt,34,2. the meaning of the rules rule meanings .
E87-1022.txt,35,In Montague Grammar these meanings are expressed in intensional logic.
E87-1022.txt,36,In the Rosetta system the meanings of rules and basic expressions are not elaborated on in a logical language_comma_ but they are represented by means of unique names.
E87-1022.txt,37,The consequence is that a meaning of a sentence can be represented as a so called semantic derivation tree a tree with the same geometry as the syntactic derivation tree but labelled with names of rule meanings and basic meanings instead of syntactic rules and basic expressions.
E87-1022.txt,38,In figure 2 an example of a semantic derivation tree is given_comma_ corresponding to the syntactic derivation tree of figure 1.
E87-1022.txt,39,As basic expressions may have various meanings_comma_ there is in general a set of semantic derivation trees corresponding to a syntactic derivation tree.
E87-1022.txt,40,There is in general a set of syntactic derivation trees corresponding to each semantic derivation tree_comma_ because a basic meaning may correspond to various basic expressions and a meaning rule may correspond to various syntactic rules.
E87-1022.txt,41,M6 I Ms M Ma B Mt M2 i B2 X X2 Bt Figure 2 semantic derivation tree corresponding to the syntacticderivatlon tree of figure 1 One Grammar Principle The analysis and generation components for one language are based on the same grammar.
E87-1022.txt,42,In other terms_comma_ we require the compositional grammar defined above to be reversible .
E87-1022.txt,43,The analysis component maps sentences onto derivation trees_comma_ the generation component maps derivation trees onto sentences.
E87-1022.txt,44,Because of this principle M grammars have to obey certain conditions.
E87-1022.txt,45,The most important condition is that for each generative syntactic rule there must be a reverse analytical rule.
E87-1022.txt,46,For a more extensive discussion of these conditions we refer to Landsbergen 1984 .
E87-1022.txt,47,Thanks to these conditions analysis algorithms can be defined which yield for any input sentence the set of syntactic derivation trees of that sentence see section 6 for the formal definitions .
E87-1022.txt,48,In addition to theoretical motives_comma_ there are economic motives for adopting the One Grammar Principle.
E87-1022.txt,49,If we plan to make translation systems that translate both from and into a particular language_comma_ it is efficient if these systems can be based on one grammar.
E87-1022.txt,50,Because of this principle it suffices most of the time to discuss the grammars from a compositional_comma_ generative point of view only.
E87-1022.txt,51,119 Isomorphy Principle Two sentences are translations of each other if their meanings are derived from the same basic meRnings in the same way_comma_ i.e. if they have the same semantic derivation tree.
E87-1022.txt,52,So this principle says that the information that has to be conveyed during translation is not only the meaning_comma_ but also the way in which the meaning is derived.
E87-1022.txt,53,This implies that we have to attune the grammars of the system in the following way 1. each basic expression in one grammar corresponds to at least one basic expression in the other grammar with the same meaning i.e. corresponding to the same basic meaning .
E87-1022.txt,54,2. each syntactic rule of one grammar corresponds to at least one rule in the other grammar with the same meaning i.e. corresponding to the same rule meaning .
E87-1022.txt,55,So_comma_ two sentences are translations of each other if they have corresponding_comma_ isomorphic syntactic derivation trees_comma_ i.e. trees with the same geometry and corresponding basic expressions and corresponding rules at the leaves and at the nodes respectively see figure 3 .
E87-1022.txt,56,Following this principle there are corresponding sets of rules_comma_ related to the same meaning rule_comma_ and corresponding sets of basic expressions_comma_ related to the same basic meaning.
E87-1022.txt,57,We call the grammars isomorphic if these corresponding sets of rules obey certain applicability conditions.
E87-1022.txt,58,The Isomorphy Principle is the most characteristic principle of the Rosetta system_comma_ as it expresses our compositional theory of translation.
E87-1022.txt,59,In this approach complex structural transfer rules are avoided_comma_ as rules and basic expressions of the source language are related locally to rules and basic expressions of the target language_comma_ although_comma_ of course_comma_ the individual grammars may be complicated because of the attuning. Principle of Interllnguality There is an intermediate language into which analysis components of various languages translate and from which the generation components of these languages are able to translate.
E87-1022.txt,60,If we combine this principle with the Isomorphy Principle_comma_ the main consequence is that the semantic derivation trees constitute the intermediate language and that the attuning of the grammars is done for possibly more than two grammars.
E87-1022.txt,61,It should be stressed that the isomorphy and not the interlinguality is the primary characteristic of the Rosetta framework.
E87-1022.txt,62,For a more extensive discussion of these principles and more interesting examples we refer to Appelo and Landsbergen 1986 .
E87-1022.txt,63,Leermakers and Rous 1986 give an . to the Rosetta method along different lines.
E87-1022.txt,64,The global design of the Rosetta system_comma_ which follows from these principles is sketched in figure 4.
E87-1022.txt,65,For each M grammar the following system components are defined an analytical and a generative morphological component_comma_ A MORPH and G MORPH.
E87-1022.txt,66,They account for the relation between strings and lexical S trees i.e. S trees corresponding to words . an analytical and a generative syntactic component_comma_ M PARSER and M GENERATOR.
E87-1022.txt,67,They account for the relation between surface trees and syntactic derivation trees.
E87-1022.txt,68,These system components follow directly from the syntactic component of an M grammar.
E87-1022.txt,69,Their formal definition is given in subsection 6.1. an analytical and a generative semantic component_comma_ A TRANSFER and G TRANSFER.
E87-1022.txt,70,They account for the relation between syntactic and semantic derivation trees.
E87-1022.txt,71,M PARSER is preceded by a component called SPARSER for surface parser which maps a sequence of lexical S trees which is the output of A MORPH onto a set of surface trees of which the lexical S trees are the leaves.
E87-1022.txt,72,This set should contain the correct surface trees_comma_ but may contain also incorrect ones.
E87-1022.txt,73,The generative counterpart_comma_ LEAVES_comma_ is trivial it maps the surface tree onto the sequence of its leaves.
E87-1022.txt,74,2 Problems with the Rosetta framework The framework outlined above has been worked out in a way that is simple and mathematically elegant_comma_ as the formal definitions in subsection 6.1 will illustrate.
E87-1022.txt,75,This formalism has also proved its value in practice the implemented systems Rosettal and Rosetta2 have been written in this framework.
E87-1022.txt,76,In the sequel we will refer to it as the Rosetta2 framework.
E87-1022.txt,77,However_comma_ it also has a number of deficiencies_comma_ which may cause problems_comma_ especially in a situation where large grammars have to be written by a group of people.
E87-1022.txt,78,Three kinds of problems can be distinguished.
E87-1022.txt,80,Lack of structure in M grammaars Grammars for natural languages are very large and inherently complex.
E87-1022.txt,81,In an M grammar the syntactic component specifies a set of rules without any internal structure.
E87-1022.txt,82,Although the mathematical elegance of free production systems is appealing_comma_ they are less suited for large grammars.
E87-1022.txt,83,As the number of rules grows_comma_ it becomes more and more desirable that the syntax be subdivided into parts with well defined tasks and well defined interfaces with other parts.
E87-1022.txt,85,This holds in particular if the grammars are developed by a group of people.
E87-1022.txt,86,It is necessary to have an explicit division of tasks and to coordinate the work of the individuals in a flexible way so that the system will be easy to modify_comma_ maintain and extend.
E87-1022.txt,87,In computer science it is common practice to divide a large task into subtasks with well defined interfaces.
E87-1022.txt,88,This is known as the modular approach.
E87-1022.txt,89,This approach has gained recognition in the field of natural language processing too cf. Isabelle and Macklovitch_comma_ 1986 and Vauquols and Boitet_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1022.txt,90,The question is how such a modular approach can be applied in a compositional grammar_comma_ in an insightful and linguistically motivated way.
E87-1022.txt,91,Lack of control on rule applications In many cases the grammar writer has a certain ordering of the rules in mind_comma_ e.g. he may want to express that the rules for inserting determiners during NP formation should be applied after the rules for inserting adjectives.
E87-1022.txt,92,In the M grammar formalism explicit ordering is impossible_comma_ but the rules can be ordered implicitly by characterizing the S trees in a specific way_comma_ e.g. by splitting up a syntactic category into several categories_comma_ and by giving the rules applicability conditions which guarantee that the aspired ordering is achieved.
E87-1022.txt,93,For example_comma_ if one wishes to order two rules that both operate on an NP_comma_ this can be achieved by creating categories NP1_comma_ NP2 and NP3 and to let the first rule transform an NP1 into an NP2 and the second rule an NP2 into an NP3.
E87-1022.txt,94,This approach w followed in Rosetta2.
E87-1022.txt,95,One of its 121 disadvantages is that it leads to a proliferation of rather unnatural categories.
E87-1022.txt,96,It is hard to find an elegant and transparent way of specifying rule order in a compositional grammar the situation is more complicated than in transformational systems llke ROBRA Vauquois and Boitet_comma_ 1985 _comma_ because rules may have more than one argument.
E87-1022.txt,97,In addition to linear ordering one may want to add other means of controlling the application of rules_comma_ e.g. one may want to make a distinction between obligatory_comma_ optional and recursive rules.
E87-1022.txt,98,In M grammars all rules are optional and potentially recursive.
E87-1022.txt,99,It is not clear how to add obligatory rules to such a free production system in fact it is hard to understand what that would mean.
E87-1022.txt,100,There is also a problem with the reversibility of obligatory rules a rule that is obligatory during generation is not necessarily obligatory during analysis.
E87-1022.txt,102,Lack of structure In the translation relation As we have explained in section 1_comma_ the translation relation between languages is defined by attuning the grammars to each other.
E87-1022.txt,103,In this way complex structural transfer as discussed in Nagao and Tsujii_comma_ 1986 can be avoided_comma_ but in some cases the dependency between the grammars may complicate individual grammars.
E87-1022.txt,104,Category mismatch is one of these translation problems_comma_ e.g. the graag iilce case_comma_ where a Dutch adverb corresponds to an English verb.
E87-1022.txt,105,In cases like this there is a mismatch of syntactic categories coupled with different behaviour with respect to_comma_ e.g._comma_ tense a verb has tense_comma_ whereas an adverb has not.
E87-1022.txt,106,In Landsbergen 1984 a solution of the graag like problem by means of isomorphic grammars w discussed_comma_ for small example grammars.
E87-1022.txt,107,For larger grammars a more systematic and structured treatment of these translation problems is needed_comma_ but this is not supported by the Rosetta2 formalism.
E87-1022.txt,108,Another problem is caused by the fact that in the isomorphic grammar framework each syntactic rule of one grammar must correspond to at least one rule of another grammar.
E87-1022.txt,109,For rules that contribute to the meaning this is exactly what we want_comma_ because what h to be conveyed during translation is not only the meaning_comma_ but also the way in which the meaning is derived.
E87-1022.txt,110,However_comma_ there is a problem with rules that are only relevant to the form of the sentence and that carry no translation relevant information_comma_ especially if they are language specific.
E87-1022.txt,111,A purely syntactic transformation as Verb Second in an SOV language like Dutch does not correspond in a natural way to a syntax rule of English.
E87-1022.txt,112,In Rosetta2 this problem could be solved in one of the following two ways by adding a corresponding rule to the English syntax that did nothing more than change the syntactic category or by merging the Dutch transformation rule with a meaningful rule.
E87-1022.txt,113,These solutions are not very elegant and complicate the grammars unnecessarily.
E87-1022.txt,114,It would be better if the correspondence between rules as required by the Isomorphy Principle must hold for meaningful rules only.
E87-1022.txt,115,The translation relation would then be defined in terms of a reduced derivation tree_comma_ which is labelled with meaningful rules.
E87-1022.txt,116,The generation component M GENERATOR will operate on such a reduced tree and will have to decide what syntactic transformations are applicable at what point of the derivation.
E87-1022.txt,117,This requires some way of controlling the applicability of the transformation rules.
E87-1022.txt,118,In the next sections we will describe the modular approach chosen for the development of Rosetta3_comma_ which may help to solve the above mentioned problems.
E87-1022.txt,119,We will discuss a syntax oriented dlvlslon into subgrammars in section 3 and a translation oriented division into rule classes in section 4.
E87-1022.txt,120,In section S we will argue that a combination of the two divisions is needed.
E87-1022.txt,121,In section 6 the newly introduced notions will get a formal treatment.
E87-1022.txt,122,It will turn out that the way in which subgrammars are defined enables us to define the control of rule applications in a transparent way.
E87-1022.txt,123,The proposed modifications are completely in accordance with the basic principles mentioned in section 1.
E87-1022.txt,124,3 Subgrammars_comma_ a Syntax Oriented Division From the computer language Modula2 cf. Wlrth_comma_ 1985 we learned the essentials of the modular approach I. divide the total into smaller parts modules with a well defined task_comma_ 2. define explicitly what is used from other parts Import and what may be used by other parts export _comma_ 3. separate the definition from the implementation.
E87-1022.txt,125,The explicit definition of import and export and the strict separation of implementation and definition makes it possible to prove the correctness of a module in terms of its imports_comma_ without having to look at the implementation of the imported modules.
E87-1022.txt,126,This tackles the above mentioned complexity problem and the coordination problem caused by the lack of structure in the M grammars nicely.
E87-1022.txt,127,In our view_comma_ applying the modular approach to grammars comes down to the following requirements 1. dividing the grammar into subgrammars with a well defined linguistic task_comma_ 22 2. defining explicitly what is visible to other subgrammars export and what is used from other subgrammars Import _comma_ 3. ensuring that the actual implementation i.e. the rules is of local significance only.
E87-1022.txt,128,Dividing grammars into subgrammars with a linguistic task has been done before_comma_ e.g. in the GETA systems cf. Vauquois and Boitet_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1022.txt,129,However_comma_ to our knowledge_comma_ they do not meet requirement 2 and 3 The actual subdivision chosen for the development of Rosetta3 was inspired by the notion projection from the X. theory of Transformational Generative Grammar cf. e.g. Chomsky_comma_ 1970 every major category X is said to have a maximal projection X z_comma_ e.g.
E87-1022.txt,130,NOUN has the maximal projection NP.
E87-1022.txt,131,Such projections provide a syntactic division of the constituents of language and appear to be a useful choice for modular units in a natural language system.
E87-1022.txt,132,Applying this idea to the compositional grammars of Rosetta implies that basic expressions have a major category X and that there are syntactic rules that will ultimately compose S trees of category X  .
E87-1022.txt,133,For each maximal projection a subgrammar can now be defined that expresses how X can be derived from X and other imported categories.
E87-1022.txt,134,We will call a possible derivation process of the projection from X to X maz a projection path see figure 5. The most important major categories and their projections in use in the Rosetta systems are NOUN NP _comma_ VERB VP _comma_ ADJ ADJP _comma_ ADV ADVP and PREP PP .
E87-1022.txt,135,R .... X z R S I 41 R X Figure 5 A projection path from X to X naz X theory also states that all projections have a similar syntactic structure i.e. phrase marker _comma_ which is represented in the schema of figure 6_comma_ but this aspect is less relevant for the Rosetta grammars.
E87-1022.txt,136,For us_comma_ it is of more interest whether they are the result of similar derivations.
E87-1022.txt,137,We will come back to this point in section 5.
E87-1022.txt,138,A sentence is usually seen as a subject predicate relation_comma_ i.e. a combination of an NP and a VP.
E87-1022.txt,139,But other speci Z ..  complement X complement Figure 6 The projection of X to X naz XP i.e. X maz categories than VP_comma_ together with an NP_comma_ can express a subject predlcate relationship as well cf. Stowell_comma_ 1981 .
E87-1022.txt,140,Such subject predlcate relations are called small clauses.
E87-1022.txt,142,This means that_comma_ starting from a basic expression of category X_comma_ in principle three S trees with a different top category X P can be derived XP_comma_ XPPROP and CLAUSE.
E87-1022.txt,143,Figure 7 shows some of the resulting derivation trees and S trees of the examples given above.
E87-1022.txt,144,Defining subgrammars in accordance with these projection paths provides a natural way of expressing the application order of the rules within a subgrammar the order is defined with respect to the projection path only.
E87-1022.txt,145,A side effect of this explicit ordering of rule application is that it enables us to use a more efficient parse algorithm M PARSER .
E87-1022.txt,146,A subgrammar can now be characterized as follows 1. export S tree of category X t p XP_comma_ XPPROP or CLAUSE 2. import S tree with a special category_comma_ the Xcategory_comma_ also called the head category. S trees with categories that are exported by other subgrammars and that can be taken as an argument by rules with more than one argument.
E87-1022.txt,147,3. rules a set of rules that take care of the projection from X to X p.
E87-1022.txt,148,Every rule has one argument_comma_ which is called the head argument_comma_ i.e. the S tree with the head category or one of the intermediate results during its projection.
E87-1022.txt,149,123 R2 NP A he CLAUSE he is sleeping Rl CLAUSE xl VP _comma__comma__comma_ sleep xL VERB A sleep R4 NP A him ADJPPROP him funny R3 ADJPPROP x2 ADJP _comma_. funny x2 ADJ funny NPPROP him a fool R6_comma_ A NP Rs him x3 NOUN ol NPPROP x NP N a fool Figure 7 The derivation trees with the resulting S trees of the projection of VERB to CLAUSE_comma_ ADJ to ADJPPROP and NOUN to NPPROP 4. control expression a definition of the possible application sequences of the rules_comma_ ordered with respect to their head arguments.
E87-1022.txt,150,Neither the rules nor the intermediate results are known to other subgrammars.
E87-1022.txt,151,They can be considered local to the subgrammar.
E87-1022.txt,152,So 1 and 2 define the relation with other subgrammars_comma_ whereas 3 and 4 are only of local significance_comma_ thus meeting our requirements for the modular approach.
E87-1022.txt,153,An example of a subgrammar is the NP subgrammar with a NOUN as head and exporting an NP.
E87-1022.txt,154,Other categories that are imported by this subgrammar are DETP_comma_ ADJPPROP_comma_ etc. the set of rules contains modification rules and determiner rules_comma_ the control expression indicates that the modification rules can be applied recursively and that they precede the determiner rules.
E87-1022.txt,155,Obviously_comma_ there will now be subgrammars that contain the same rules_comma_ e.g. the subgrammars for NOUN to NP and PRONOUN to NP.
E87-1022.txt,156,For efficiency reasons_comma_ it is allowed to merge such subgrammars by defining a set of heads as import and a set of top categories as export.
E87-1022.txt,157,For an elaboration of the notion control expression and a formalisation of subgrammars we refer to section 6.
E87-1022.txt,158,The advantages of this division into subgrammars are 1 that the structure of the grammar has become more transparent_comma_ 2 that we now have units with welldefined interfaces which enables us to divide the work over several people_comma_ 3 that we can work at and test smaller parts of a grammar.
E87-1022.txt,159,4 Rule Classes_comma_ a Translation Oriented Division In the Rosetta framework as sketched in section 1_comma_ the translation relation is defined at the level of rules and basic expressions.
E87-1022.txt,160,If there is a rule or basic expression in one grammar_comma_ there must be at least one rule or basic expression in the other grammar with the same meaning the Isomorphy Principle .
E87-1022.txt,161,It is hard to get hold of the translation relation as a whole in terms of these primitives alone.
E87-1022.txt,162,What we need is some structure of a higher order.
E87-1022.txt,164,We distinguish purely syntactic rules called transformations and meaningful rules.
E87-1022.txt,165,Some rules in the Rosetta grammars do not carry meaning _comma_ but serve only a syntactic_comma_ transformational purpose.
E87-1022.txt,166,In the Rosetta2 framework these meaningless rules_comma_ which are often of a highly language specific character_comma_ sometimes required rules in other languages that were of no use there.
E87-1022.txt,167,124 This point was already mentioned in section 2.
E87-1022.txt,168,Such rules are now no longer considered to be part of the translation relation that is expressed by the isomorphy relation between the grammars.
E87-1022.txt,169,Therefore_comma_ they can be added freely to a grammar.
E87-1022.txt,170,In this way a better distinction can be made between purely syntactic and hence languagespecific knowledge and translation relevant knowledge.
E87-1022.txt,171,The translation relation now can be freed from improper elements_comma_ which is highly desirable.
E87-1022.txt,172,In section 2 it was noticed that the .
E87-1048.txt,1,topic of the paper is the problem how to define case relations by semantic predicates. A general principle is outlined_comma_ which renders it possible to calculate case relations for a given representation of a verb sememe by means of expressions.
E87-1048.txt,2,This principle is based on an assignment of case relations to primitive predicates and modification rules for nested expressions.
E87-1048.txt,3,Contrary to the traditional case grammar it turns out ha one needs mixed case relations_comma_ especially for two reasons Arguments occur at too different places in an expression or arguments iave combined case relations.
E87-1048.txt,4,The consequence is that case relations don t form a set of isolated elements but a structured system.
E87-1048.txt,6,The paper is not intended for defending case relations in general.
E87-1048.txt,7,I want to s e ch only some problems connected with the definition of case relations ud will demonstrate consequences_comma_ which seem partly a oit unconventional .
E87-1048.txt,8,I will not enter into the terminological discussion on deep cases_comma_ case relations etc. and subsume all these variants under the label case relation .
E87-1048.txt,9,This is justified by the obvious fact that there are more proposals and systems than authors.
E87-1048.txt,10,So one will not overcome this chaos by neat terminological distinctions.
E87-1048.txt,11,It is rather typical for publications on deep cases that proposals are presented without sufficient motivation or justification e. g. Nilsen 1973 .
E87-1048.txt,12,It has turned out tha in the matter of case relations as a field of linguistic and fundamental research intuition and language competence cannot show the right way how to solve the problems of defining them.
E87-1048.txt,13,This is my first conclusion from the general scene.
E87-1048.txt,14,Without doubt it is inevitable to work out some principles on the basis of which case relations may be defined.
E87-1048.txt,15,This would enable us to discuss a rather clear object some principles instead of tens or hundreds of proposals _comma_ to evaluate and compare existing proposals_comma_ to connect case relations with other essential notions.
E87-1048.txt,16,Quite another question is What are case relations good for .
E87-1048.txt,17,One cannot ignore the fact that a lot of serious objections against case relations have been advanced_comma_ covering a whole range from they are redundant till the swamp of lacking plausible or even formal definitions resulting in the conclusion that case relations are useless especially for computational linguistics Mellema 1974_comma_ Luckhardt 1985 .
E87-1048.txt,18,On the other hand many authors are advocates pro case relations_comma_ even in MT e. g. Nagao 1986_comma_ Somers 1986 .
E87-1048.txt,19,Here the character of case relations as a link or pivot is stressed between surface and deep level or between nguages.
E87-1048.txt,20,For sucA situations one can cept the use of case relations without exact definitions having an experimental system as a touchstone.
E87-1048.txt,21,Case rela ion are considered here as names or labels of arguments in semantic redicates used for the description of verb sememes.
E87-1048.txt,22,This is only one side of the coin
E87-1048.txt,23,The second important aspect are the means by which deep cases are expressed at the surface grammatical cases_comma_ prepositions_comma_ linear order_comma_ ... .
E87-1048.txt,24,They have to be taken into account as well_comma_ and only both aspects together will yield an adequate picture.
E87-1048.txt,26,Case relations and semantic predicates One possibility to grasp the whole problem seems to be the definition of case relations on the basis of semantic predicates.
E87-1048.txt,27,Sememes of vero lexemes are represented by expressions containing primitive semantic predicates.
E87-1048.txt,28,The following expression may be assigned to a verb like to convey a conveys b from c to d 1 MOVE ACTION a_comma_b_comma_c_comma_d ACAUSE a_comma_CHANGE POSITION b_comma_c_comma_d cf. Allen 1984 .
E87-1048.txt,29,I will not discuss the question whether ACAUSE  agent causation and CH GE POSITTON are indeed 302 primitive predicates.
E87-1048.txt,30,I consider them here as that.
E87-1048.txt,31,Furthermore one may discuss whether 5 sufficiently describes the meaning of to convey .
E87-1048.txt,32,The idea of extracting case relations from representations lige 1 can be bases on the following principles A For each primitlve predicate P there is an assignment of exactly one case relation to every argument place zi P r i th argument of P h s case relation ri B There are modification rules for case relations which render it possible to calculate the case relations for nested expressions.
E87-1048.txt,33,A means e. g. that for a primitive predicate like CHANGE POSITION w know the case relations of the argument places b_comma_ c and d 2 zi C JdIGE POSITION  r i for 1 i 3 In this sense one can state without doubt 3 Zl ACAUSE agent  z3 CHANGE POSTTION goal B may be interpreted in the following way If we know MOVE ACtION has the form given in 1 _comma_ the value of z2 ACAUSE _comma_ second place of ACAUSE is filled in by CHA2 E POSITION_comma_ the value of Zl CHANGE POSITION _comma_ then we know the value of z2 EOVE ACTION _comma_ i. e. the case relation of b in the whole expression 1 .
E87-1048.txt,34,Formally this may be expressed by a four place modification mapping m 5 zg MOVE ACTION m ACAUSE_comma_ z2 ACAUSE _comma_ CHANGE POSIT ON_comma_ z I CHANGE POSITION One may speculate whether all four arguments are indeed necessary_comma_ they are surely no .
E87-1048.txt,35,A similar idea is presented in Thiel 1982 p. 84 ff. _comma_ where the mechanism of modification is applied_comma_ tOO.
E87-1048.txt,36,A general scheme for B is the following Assume one has 6 .._comma_ s ..._comma_x_comma_... _comma_... where x is the j th argument in Q_comma_ S ... the k th argument in R and x the 1 th argument in S.
E87-1048.txt,37,Then zg Q is a function of R_comma_ Zk R _comma_ S an Zl S .
E87-1048.txt,38,Thiel s proposal_comma_ namely zj Q m R_comma_ Zl S _comma_ would cause some dlfficulties_comma_ if R is a many place predicate and there are in R arguments S and S with z I_comma_ S Zl_comma__comma_ S cf. the FEED example below .
E87-1048.txt,39,Thiel himself excludes this case explicitely.
E87-1048.txt,40,The principles A and B form a recursive scheme A provides the results for certain predicates_comma_ B renders it ossible to determine the results for verb sememes in general.
E87-1048.txt,41,At arj rage one would get a nice formalism for calculating case frames if A and B are fulfilled.
E87-1048.txt,42,Unfortunately_comma_ there are some additional problems I will deal with below.
E87-1044.txt,1,work concerns integration between syntax and semantics. Syntactic and semantic activities rely on separate bodies of knowledges.
E87-1044.txt,2,Integration is obtained by exploiting the isomorphism between grammatical relations among immediate constitu errs and conceptual relations_comma_ thanks to a limited set of formal mapping rules.
E87-1044.txt,3,Syntactic analysis does not construct all the explicit parse trees but just a graph that represents all the plausible grammatical relations among immediate constituents.
E87-1044.txt,4,Such graph gives the semantic interpreter_comma_ based on Conceptual Graphs formalism_comma_ the discriminative power required to establish conceptual relations.
E87-1044.txt,6,In the field of automatic natural language understanding_comma_ the problem of connecting syntax and semantics has been faced in three different ways.
E87-1044.txt,7,Some authors are persuaded that understanding natural language requires no use of syntactic knowledge.
E87-1044.txt,8,They claim that semantic representation can be built directly from the surface string_comma_ without the help of almost any syntactic source 1 .
E87-1044.txt,9,Other authors proposed highly syntactic systems_comma_ starting from the idea that the representation of the syntactic structure is preliminary to the understanding process 2 .
E87-1044.txt,10,While the work of this second group of researchers was concerned mainly with the understanding of individual sentences_comma_ the work of the partisans of semantics was about the understanding of whole texts.
E87-1044.txt,11,This shifting of attention substained the idea that syntax and semantics should be used in an integrated way.
E87-1044.txt,12,Most researchers have thought that semantics and syntax should be integrated with respect to both the representation and the processing 3 others have claimed that it is more efficient to build a full blooded syntactic representation during the parsing process 4 .
E87-1044.txt,17,We reckon that semantic and syntactic processes should rely on separate knowledge bodies.
E87-1044.txt,18,Uur effort is mainly focused on the realization of the integration by exploiting the isomorphism between syntactic structures and semantic representations_comma_ rather than by making syntactic and semantic processes interact_comma_ as it happens in previous integrated parsers 5 .
E87-1044.txt,19,The idea of isomorphism is not carried out through one to one correspondence between syntactic rules and semantic ones as in Montague inspired parsers 6 _comma_ but by mapping in a formal way grammatical and conceptual relations.
E87-1044.txt,20,The use of grammatical relations as intermediate level between syntax and semantics was also adopted in the KING KONG parser 7 _comma_ but this system is still more near to the position which wants the representation of syntax and semantics as well as their processes to interact_comma_ while our choice is to maintain separate these different sources of knowledge.
E87-1044.txt,21,The subsequent paragraphs describe how this hypothesis works in SHEZLA Syntax Helping Expectations In Language Analysis _comma_ a prototype developed at CSELT laboratories Turin_comma_ Italy .
E87-1044.txt,22,The aim of SHEILA is to analyze and to extract relevant information from news coming from the Italian news agency ANSA .
E87-1044.txt,23,The system is initially being applied to texts describing variations in the topmanagement of commercial societies it has been fully implemented on a Symbolics Lisp machine.
E87-1044.txt,24,SHEILA takes advantage both from the use of expectations and from the combination of the results of a non conventional syntactic analysis with the activity of a surface semantic analysis_comma_ based on the formalism of conceptual graphs 8 .
E87-1044.txt,25,In this paper we describe just the principles which guide the integration between syntax and semantics.
E87-1044.txt,26,SHEILA correctly analyzes a set of thirty news_comma_ generating for each of them a set of records for a relational data base.
E87-1044.txt,28,THE PROBLEM AND OUR PROPOSAL In text understanding systems syntax and semantics have almost always been dealt with integration of their processing.
E87-1044.txt,32,278 systems are semantic driven and they do only local syntactic checks during analysis.
E87-1044.txt,33,Doing local syntactic checks only involves little amount of syntactic knowledge and that is misleading in solving problems as anaphoric reference_comma_ prepositional attachment_comma_ conjunction and so on.
E87-1044.txt,34,In a different approach the integration has been realized during the syntactic structure representation construction the syntactic parser makes use of semantic information to handle structural ambiguities.
E87-1044.txt,35,The questioning done by the syntactic analyzer to the semantic component a ms to cut down the number of parse trees_comma_ but very many rules are required for this questioning_comma_ which has always been the most domain dependent part of natural language understanding systems.
E87-1044.txt,36,In designing SHEILA we chose another way of integrating syntax with semantics.
E87-1044.txt,37,The basic schema may look rather classic the system produces a syntactic analysis of the text_comma_ driven on the basis of purely syntactic knowledge.
E87-1044.txt,38,The semantic analyzer checks the syntactic output to see if the semantic relations among words are supported by it.
E87-1044.txt,39,But a classical syntax first analysis is highly inefficient.
E87-1044.txt,40,It cannot solve structural ambiguities without the help of any semantic source and that leads to an explosion of the number of syntactic parse trees_comma_ some of them representing artificial syntactic ambiguities.
E87-1044.txt,41,So there are two problems reducing the explosion of ambiguities and determining how semantic patterns for each word interact with syntax.
E87-1044.txt,42,Our proposal faces these problems through the original combination of two key ideas_comma_ i.e. I a flexible syntactic analysis_comma_ which is performed by constructing not all the explicit parse trees but just a graph_comma_ representing all the plausible grammatical relations among immediate constituents 2 a formal way of interaction between syntax and semantics exploiting the isomorphism between syntactic structures grammatical relations among immediate constituents and semantic ones conceptual relations .
E87-1044.txt,43,Such flexible syntactic analysis gains a discriminative power sufficient for aiding semantics in solving ambiguities and avoids the explosion in the parse trees number.
E87-1044.txt,44,Furthermore_comma_ the mapping between grammatical and conceptual relations can be defined through a limited set of formal rules.
E87-1044.txt,46,THE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS Our system has the goal of generating a semantic structure that has to be consistent with the syntactic form used to convey it in the text.
E87-1044.txt,47,The aim of syntactic analysis is to support semantics.
E87-1044.txt,48,A first activity performed by the syntactic nalyzer is the recognition of constituents of the phrase structure of text.
E87-1044.txt,49,This is done by applying a set of rewriting phrase structure rules for Italian language.
E87-1044.txt,50,These rules utilize the output of a previous morphological analysis that assigns to words morphological and lexical features gender_comma_ number_comma_ lexical category and so on .
E87-1044.txt,51,In this analysis phase the application of the syntactic rules is limited to the recognition of the basic constituents of the phrase structure of the sentences.
E87-1044.txt,52,A basic constituent BC_comma_ henceforth is a NP_comma_ a PP or a VP described at a minimal level of complexity.
E87-1044.txt,53,At this level the grammar does not include rules of the form S  NP VP or NP  NP PP _comma_ but it does include all the rules which describe the internal structures of BCs at the lowest level of recursion.
E87-1044.txt,54,Every BC has a head and may have one or more modifier.
E87-1044.txt,55,The head of a BC is the characteristic word_comma_ the word without which a group of words would fail to be an instance of that particular BC.
E87-1044.txt,56,So the head of a NP is a noun_comma_ that of a PP is a preposition_comma_ that of a VP is a verb_comma_ etc. g .
E87-1044.txt,57,The head of a BC carries on all the morphological_comma_ syntactical and lexical features of the BC itself 10 .
E87-1044.txt,58,Let us consider the sentence I Arturo vide una commedia con Meryl Streep. . which may be interpreted both 1.a Arthur and Meryl Streep saw a play together and 1.b Arthur saw Meryl Streep while she was working in a play.
E87-1044.txt,60,In fact while for syntax is sufficient to know all the relevant information concerning the preposition_comma_ semantics also need to know the information concerning the head of the NP which forms the PP.
E87-1044.txt,63,279 The output of this first step of syntactic analysis is a structure that includes the syntactic ambiguities which will be properly treated at the second level of analysis 11 .
E87-1044.txt,64,The second level of syntactic analysis has the goal of solving the problems about prepositional phrase attachment_comma_ noun phrase modification and conjunction and that of establishing grammatical relations among BCs 12 .
E87-1044.txt,65,In the usual syntactic approach this activity_comma_ performed among more complex constituents_comma_ leads to the explosion of structural ambiguities.
E87-1044.txt,66,In our case the problem of handling ambiguity strongly arises in fact the syntactic analyzer has been designed in order to treat a large variety of real texts which contain words out of their preferred grammatical order or which present elliptical constructions or_comma_ finally_comma_ which present very complex grammatical constructs.
E87-1044.txt,67,To reach such an adequacy we relax the grammar constraints_comma_ but that may cause the generation of artificial structural ambiguities 13 .
E87-1044.txt,68,In order to solve this problem_comma_ we see all the groups of BCs having the same head as belonging to an equivalence class of constituents.
E87-1044.txt,69,Let us consider an example concerning this important point.
E87-1044.txt,70,In Italian the phrase I1 sindaco Rossi di Torino The major Rossi of Turin may involve some structural ambiguity if it has to be parsed without the help of semantic hints.
E87-1044.txt,71,In fact_comma_ this noun phrase can mean both that Rossi is the major of Turin and that Rossi is a major who comes from Turin.
E87-1044.txt,72,Performing a classical analysis this ambiguity generates two different structural descriptions.
E87-1044.txt,73,The first interpretation can be described as NP NP pp f A A IL SINDACO ROSSI Ol TORINO 11 At this level we have not so many ambiguities because the linguis tic phenomena which cause them are still not faced.
E87-1044.txt,74,In this phase of analysis lexical ambiguity involving uncertainty about the lexical category of a given word only arises this kind of ambiguity is treated by taking into account the syntagmatic relationships of the words in question the analyzer keeps different interpretations for the ambiguity which can not be solved without semantics.
E87-1044.txt,75,12 Grammatical relations are primitive notions such as subject_comma_ object_comma_ complement and so on.
E87-1044.txt,76,13 The constraining power is provided setting up a structural homology between syntactic and semantic levels and performing the formal mapping between grammatical relations and conceptual relations. while the second interpretation can be described as NP NP NP A A I1 SINDACO ROSSI PP f DI TORINO In our analysis we handle this problem starting from the consideration that in both the interpretations the NP Rossi is the head of the resulting structural unit.
E87-1044.txt,77,So the analyzer generates only one representation for the new construction in this way SPECIFICATION NP NP PP A A IL SINDACO R SSI Ol TORINO Now_comma_ let us consider this construction as being part of a sentence 2 Il sindaco Rossi di Torino parte per Roma. The major Rossi of Turin is leaving for Rome. The ascription of grammatical relations among the phrases of this sentence requires the recognition of the NP ll sindaco Rossi di Torino as subject of the sentence and the PP per Roma as modifier of the VP.
E87-1044.txt,78,The detection of the subject relation does not necessarily involve the problem of structural ambiguity because this is limited at the relations between the two NPs and the first PP.
E87-1044.txt,79,So the analyzer gives the following description of the sentence SPECIFIC.
E87-1044.txt,80,SUBJECT P V COMPLEM.
E87-1044.txt,81,N P  pp IL SINDACO C13 3 Ol TORINO PARTE PER ROMA Thanks to this treatment of ambiguity_comma_ the syntactic structure of this sentence can be described by only one representation_comma_ while a classical syntactic analysis would generate at least two repre280 sentations.
E87-1044.txt,82,Our single representation consists of a graph of BCs connected by grammatical relations_comma_ which are established unless syntactic knowledge guarantees that no constituent in the two classes can be connected by such relations.
E87-1044.txt,83,In this way the processing is efficient almost as in the case of complete parallelism between syntax and semantics and_comma_ in addition_comma_ there is complete compatibility with a parallel implementation.
E87-1044.txt,84,Note that none of the possible interpretations has been lost all them are passed to the semantic interpreter which operates the resolution of ambiguity taking into account both the connections between the BCs pointed out by syntactic analysis and the semantic plausibility of the proposed connections.
E87-1044.txt,85,The resulting discriminative power of syntax is still sufficient for helping semantics in establishing the correct semantic relations among concepts denoted by words.
E87-1044.txt,87,THE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS Our working hypothesis is that we can represent the meaning of a text starting from the meanings of words and from the syntactic structure of the text.
E87-1044.txt,88,We represent the surface semantic structure by conceptual graphs 14 .
E87-1044.txt,89,A conceptual graph is an oriented bipartite graph with two kinds of nodes concept nodes representing entities and conceptual relation nodes representing semantic relations among concepts .
E87-1044.txt,90,A Type Hierarchy is defined over concepts.
E87-1044.txt,91,The semantic information is distributed on words by means of canonical graphs_comma_ which describe concepts connoted by the words of the domain in terms of their semantic context they represent the implicit pattern of relationships necessary for a semantically well formed text.
E87-1044.txt,92,In each canonical graph we can distinguish a head the main concept node of the canonical graph itself and a semantic context see figure I .
E87-1044.txt,93,The Type Hierarchy is a taxonomy of domain concepts used to inherit semantic contexts and guide graph joins.
E87-1044.txt,94,The aim of surface semantic analysis is to establish semantic relations among the head nodes of canonical graphs connoted by the words of text.
E87-1044.txt,95,First_comma_ the canonical graphs are activated copied in the working memory then the activated graphs are joined_comma_ superimposing context nodes on head nodes according with the Type Hierarchy so relations are established among head concepts.
E87-1044.txt,97,This formalism is a generalization of various previous approaches to the representation of the semantic relations holding among words such as frames_comma_ semantic networks and conceptual dependency. is checked to see if a grammatical relation supports the proposed semantic one.
E87-1044.txt,98,Otherwise the semantic relation is not established.
E87-1044.txt,100,INTEGRATING SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS During semantic analysis relations between concept nodes are established only if they are supported by the result of syntactic analysis.
E87-1044.txt,101,Given a semantic relation_comma_ it is necessary to see if there is a corresponding grammatical relation.
E87-1044.txt,102,The correspondence between grammatical relations and semantic relations mapping is solved through the notion of head which has been introduced both in syntax heads of BCs and in semantics heads of canonical graphs .
E87-1044.txt,103,The semantic relations and the grammatical relations must relate to the same couple of lexical items in other words such lexical items must be both the heads of the BCs involved by the grammatical relation and the heads of the conceptual graphs involved by the semantic relation .
E87-1044.txt,104,A semantic relation SR between two head nodes HNi and HNj_comma_ having as heads the words Wi and Wj_comma_ can only be established if I there is a grammatical relation GR between two BCs_comma_ BCi and BCj_comma_ whose heads are Wi and Wj respectively.
E87-1044.txt,105,2 semantic relation SR is compatible with the grammatical relation GR and with the set of features Fi and Fj associated to BCi and BCj.
E87-1044.txt,106,Conditions are verified through the application of a mapping rule among a limited set.
E87-1044.txt,107,Each semantic relation inside a semantic context of a canonical conceptual graph is augmented with the indication of a mapping rule.
E87-1044.txt,108,A mapping rule is a list of plausible grammatical relations that can correspond to the semantic relation.
E87-1044.txt,109,In a mapping rule each grammatical relation can be constrained by an activation condition that relates to the morphologic and syntactic features of the involved BC classes.
E87-1044.txt,110,5.1 An example Let us consider the example of the figure 2.
E87-1044.txt,111,The join J1 of the head conceptual node HNI with the context node CN2_comma_1 of the head node HN2 causes a conceptual relation AGENT to be established between concept nodes HNI and HN2.
E87-1044.txt,112,Such head concept nodes correspond to words WI John and W2 eats at the lexical level.
E87-1044.txt,113,Such conceptual relation has an associated mapping rule which requires a grammatical relation of a certain kind e.g. subject .
E87-1044.txt,114,Such grammatical relation must have been established by syntactic analysis between two BCs having WI and W2 as their heads.
E87-1044.txt,115,As that is the case of figure 2_comma_ the join J1 can be made.
E87-1044.txt,116,281 Differently_comma_ join J4 between HN3 and CN2_comma_1 can not be established as it would cause an AGENT relation between conceptual nodes HN2 eat and HN3 chicken such semantic relation is not supported by a suitable grammatical relation.
E87-1044.txt,117,In fact there is a grammatical relation between BC2 and BC3_comma_ but it is not the correct one because the grammatical relation object can not correspond to the semantic relation AGENT.
E87-1044.txt,118,To give an idea of the mapping rules_comma_ the MR AGENT mapping rule is sketched.
E87-1044.txt,119,It is used to map the conceptual relation AGENT on the grammatical relation subject if the analyzed sentence is active or on the grammatical relation agentive if the sentence is passive MR AGENT subject if BC1 is ACTIVE and BCl and BC2 agree. agentive if BC1 is PASSIVE and BC2 is a by phrase 6.
E87-1044.txt,120,CONCLUSION The SHEILA system has been presented as an attempt to solve the problem of integrating syntax and semantics.
E87-1044.txt,121,The authors propose that syntactic and semantic processes should rely on distinct bodies of knowledge and that the interaction between syntax and semantics should be obtained by exploiting_comma_ in a formal way_comma_ the isomorphism between syntactic and semantic structures.
E87-1044.txt,122,In order to avoid the lack of efficiency characterizing a syntax first parser_comma_ the authors have designed a flexible syntax which_comma_ without exploding the structural ambiguities_comma_ supplies semantic interpreter with knowledge about syntactic connections between the words occurring in the text.
E87-1044.txt,123,The isomorphism between syntax and semantics is accounted into a limited set of formal mapping rules and conditions.
E87-1044.txt,124,Prepositional phrase attachment_comma_ apposition_comma_ determination of conjunction s scope and modification of a NP through other NPs are dealt in a satisfactory way both from a syntactical and from a semantical point of view.
E87-1044.txt,125,Other complex linguistic phenomena as anaphora_comma_ quantification and ellipsis requires a more extensive use of heuristics.
E87-1044.txt,126,The future work will concentrate on these specific aspects in order to check the adequacy of the hypothesis of isomorphism between syntactic and semantic structures to larger fragments of the Italian language. .
E87-1024.txt,1,paper reports work on the design of a natural language interface with a limited dialogue capability. It is argued that i The interpretation of the input is preferably represented as a structure of Discourse Object Descriptions DODs ii The DODs must be determined on the basis of different types of knowledge such as grammatical knowledge_comma_ object type deirmitions and knowledge about existing discourse objects and their discourse status iii The different types of knowledge are stored separately but integrated in the interpretation process which is based on constraints. .
E87-1024.txt,2,The LINLIN project is concerned with the development of general purpose natural language interfaces NLIs to computer software with special emphasis on communication in Swedish.
E87-1024.txt,3,A useful general purpose NLI must meet a var ety of requirements_comma_ a number of which concern communicative ability.
E87-1024.txt,4,The communicative abilities of as NLI are necessarily restricted by the limitations of existing techniques_comma_ but can also be purposely restricted to enhance transparency.
E87-1024.txt,5,It is not certain that the linguistically more competent NLI is the most useful one_comma_ e.g. if its behaviour appears idiosyncratic to the user.
E87-1024.txt,6,In any case_comma_ the language of an NLI is a language designed and is in that respect not a natural language so there are many questions to be answered about how it should be designed_comma_ both in terms of how it should function as a vehicle of communication and in terms of internal representations and procedures.
E87-1024.txt,7,As for the first aspect we are conducting a series of simulations to fred out what communicative abilities an NLI should have Dahlb k J neson_comma_ 1986 _comma_ but meanwhile we are assuming that LINLIN should meet the following demands it should have a fair knowledge of the structure of Swedish words_comma_ clauses and utterances_comma_ an s This work is part of the project Analysis and Generation of Natural Lan _comma_ruage Texts supported by the National Swedish Board of Technical Development. extendable lexicon_comma_ an extendable knowledge of object types_comma_ an ability to cope with directives_comma_ questions and assertions as they relate to the current background system s and a restricted ability to engage in a dialogue with the user.
E87-1024.txt,8,The dialogue capabilities of LINLIN are primarily designed for the following purposes a to enable the user to make explicit and implicit cross .
E87-1009.txt,1,other than English have received little attention as far as the application of natural language processing techniques to text composition is concerned. The present paper describes briefly work under development aiming at the design of an integrated environment for the construction and verification of documents written in Spanish. in a first phase_comma_ a dictionary of Spanish has been implemented_comma_ together with a synonym dictionary.
E87-1009.txt,2,The main features of both dictionaries will be summarised_comma_ and how they are applied in an environment for document verification and composition. .
E87-1009.txt,3,In the field of document processing many tools exist today which allow the user to introduce a text in storage_comma_ format it_comma_ and even_comma_ for a few languages_comma_ verify the spelling_comma_ punctuation and style il_comma_ 2_comma_ 3_comma_ 41.
E87-1009.txt,4,English has been for a long time TIIE Natural Language_comma_ object of a large number of research and development work in Computational Linguistics.
E87-1009.txt,5,Other languages_comma_ however Spanish among them _comma_ have received little attention as far as the application of natural language processing techniques to text composition is concerned.
E87-1009.txt,6,The present paper describes briefly work under development aiming at the design of an integrated environment for the construction and verification of documents written in Spanish_comma_ for which no similar tools exist at the moment.
E87-1009.txt,7,In a first phase_comma_ a dictionary of Spanish was implemented.
E87-1009.txt,8,This is a task of multiple interest_comma_ a dictionary being the one of the basic tools for any application to systems where Natural Language is involved.
E87-1009.txt,9,Thus its development was undertaken with two guidelines_comma_ completeness and generality.
E87-1009.txt,10,At present_comma_ the dictionary is finished in a version including about 35_comma_000 stems_comma_ which_comma_ inflected_comma_ give rise to more than 400_comma_000 different words.
E87-1009.txt,11,Together with this inflected forms lexicon_comma_ a synonym dictionary was also built as a second step in the text processing system this dictionary has about 15_comma_000 entries.
E87-1009.txt,12,In this paper we summarise the main features of both dictionaries and how they are applied in an environment for document verification and composition.
E87-1009.txt,13,Present and planned enhancements will be also described_comma_ including the use of a parser of Spanish and the addition of other features.
E87-1009.txt,15,The information so obtained was classified and filtered_comma_ taking into account the objective and first set up application the corpus had to cover ttrual written iangltage_comma_ and in this field should account for as much of the vocabulary as possible.
E87-1009.txt,16,The dictionary consists of a list of inflected words_comma_ without associated definitions.
E87-1009.txt,17,Every word has additionally a number of other information gender_comma_ number_comma_ lime_comma_ person_comma_ mode_comma_ etc. In general_comma_ words belonging to restricted or specialised domains medicine_comma_ law_comma_ poetry_comma_ linguistics_comma_ etc. are not listed.
E87-1009.txt,18,Neither are colloquial terms_comma_ including rude or slang words.
E87-1009.txt,19,Very specific regional uses of Spanish have also not been considered like Argentina s voseo ten s_comma_ querY.s _comma_ nor the form of subjunctive future tuviere_comma_ quisiere _comma_ restricted today to legal writings.
E87-1009.txt,20,Many derived forms have also been excluded_comma_ like diminutives_comma_ pejoratives_comma_ superlatives but not Ihe irregulars as for adverbs finishing inmenle_comma_ only the most usual ones have been listed. lnfi rnlation on the lexicon is contained in two main files the base forms file_comma_ and the inflective morphemes file_comma_ which are described in the following sections.
E87-1009.txt,21,Base furms file It includes tile complete list of terms just described_comma_ specifying the base form on which they inflect.
E87-1009.txt,22,They have pointers referring to the derivative morphemes file.
E87-1009.txt,23,I ach entry has the following specifications .
E87-1009.txt,24,Functional category_comma_ i.e._comma_ verb_comma_ noun_comma_ adjective_comma_ adverb_comma_ preposition_comma_ conjunction_comma_ article_comma_ pronoun_comma_ interjection words with more than one 52 associated part of speech will have as many marks as categories.
E87-1009.txt,26,Verbs_comma_ very complex because of the large number of irregularities and difficult classification_comma_ are qualified as transitive_comma_ intransitive or auxiliary.
E87-1009.txt,27,Further slots are foreseen to code their behaviour in the language and their usage at the surface level complements_comma_ adverbials_comma_ etc. Possible combinations of verbs and ciitic pronouns are also marked.
E87-1009.txt,29,There are additional marks for hyphenation points for later use by a formatter performing automatic syllable partition _comma_ and several other for foreign and Latin words_comma_ geographical terms_comma_ etc. Inflective morphemes file It specifies the derivative morphemes used in the generation of inflected forms starting from the previous base forms.
E87-1009.txt,30,A list of paradigms has been built for each category of nouns_comma_ adjectives and verbs_comma_ to account for the different models of inflection.
E87-1009.txt,31,The classification takes into account the problems arising from the automatic processing of inflections_comma_ i.e._comma_ it considers as irregularities some behaviours not considered as such in the literature_comma_ for example_comma_ some purely phonetic cases_comma_ like z _comma_ e before e_comma_ i e.g. eazar _comma_ cace _comma_ and cases related with diacritic signs_comma_ both dieresis e.g. avergonzar _comma_ avergi enzo _comma_ and accents e.g. joven _comma_ j venes_comma_ carcicter caracteres .
E87-1009.txt,32,Additionally_comma_ it is necessary to consider cases of incomplete inflections e.g. in adjectives_comma_ avizor only exists in masculine singular_comma_ and alisios only in masculine plural in names_comma_ alicates exists only in masculine plural_comma_ afueras only in feminine plural .
E87-1009.txt,33,As for verbs_comma_ this kind of irregularity is present in the socalled defectives e.g. llover_comma_ abolir_comma_ pudrir_comma_ etc. .
E87-1009.txt,34,Finally_comma_ there are words with more than one realisation in one of their forms e.g. variz varice_comma_ both correct in feminine singular .
E87-1009.txt,35,In some adjectives_comma_ a similar problem arises depending on their position if they come in front of the noun their apocopated form appears_comma_ but not if they come after e.g. buen bueno_comma_ mal malo _comma_ and in verbs_comma_ in all subjunctive imperfect forms e.g. saliera saliese _comma_ and in a few other isolated cases e.g. the imperative satisfaz satisface .
E87-1009.txt,36,Together with adjectives marked for gender e.g. rojo_comma_ roja _comma_ there are others unmarked e.g. amable _comma_ and their gender is defined according to the noun they modify.
E87-1009.txt,37,Among them_comma_ some work in fixed and restricted contexts_comma_ and are defined because they only modify masculine or feminine nouns e.g. tnrcaz_comma_ avizor .
E87-1009.txt,38,It must be noted that the large number of irregularities in the inflection mechanism has obliged to detail each one of them_comma_ as they could not be included in any of the general models.
E87-1009.txt,39,This means that many paradigms have been defined which just comprise a little number of cases.
E87-1009.txt,42,This has allowed to develop a thorough study on synonymy together with a complete critique of one of the best known synonym dictionaries of the Spanish language.
E87-1009.txt,43,First of all_comma_ the coherence of both dictionaries has been kept_comma_ so that words included in the synonym base are also present in the main lexicon.
E87-1009.txt,44,The need to keep the semantic consistency in the dictionary contents was a first objective.
E87-1009.txt,45,It showed the little rigor with which printed dictionaries are constructed and allowed for the application of systematic tests and modifications to our version in order to keep symmetry_comma_ to cater for hyperonymy_comma_ to bind cross referencing into semantically reasonable limits_comma_ etc. A forthcoming paper will describe the problems met and the main tasks performed.
E87-1009.txt,46,Starling from syntactic marks in the inflected forms dictionary_comma_ an entry in the synonym dictionary will appear as many times as parts of speech it is assigned.
E87-1009.txt,47,For example_comma_ the word circular can be an adjective marked as j_comma_ meaning circular _comma_ a feminine noun marked as nf_comma_ meaning note _comma_ and a verb marked as v_comma_ meaning move _comma_ circulate .
E87-1009.txt,48,The corresponding entries would be circular i redondo_comma_ curvo_comma_ curvado. circular nf orden_comma_ aviso _comma_ notificacitn_comma_ carta_comma_ nota. circular v andar_comma_ moverse_comma_ transitar _comma_ pasear_comma_ deambular divulgarse_comma_ propagarse_comma_ expandirse_comma_ difundirse.
E87-1009.txt,49,Additionally_comma_ inside a part of speech_comma_ synonyms are grouped according to the different semantic sense or nuance.
E87-1009.txt,50,Also allowed are cross .
E87-1029.txt,1,auxilliaries and clitics have been analysed in the flame of U.C.G. Unification Categorial Grammar .
E87-1029.txt,2,Concatenation of a functor sign and an adjacent argument sign is the basic operation of the model unification allows a to verify ff constraints on concatenation are respected b to produce a flow of information between the functor sign and the argument sign.
E87-1029.txt,3,The rules of the grammar and the design structure of the sign allows to express a the concatenation between French auxilliaries are and avoir and the participle verb form within a single pattern_comma_ b transitions between clitics in a systematic way.
E87-1029.txt,4,Two complex questions of French syntax are thus covered in a fairly simple way.
E87-1029.txt,5,The UCG Model U nification .
E87-1029.txt,8,Functional application applies in UCG as in categorial grammars it allows for concatenation of a functor with an adjacent argument.
E87-1029.txt,9,Unification is a basic operation which allows a to verify if constraints on concatenation are respected b to produce a flow of information between functor and argument.
E87-1029.txt,10,This information together with some defined aspects of the information carried by the functor_comma_ will be finally inscribed in the resulting concatenated sign.
E87-1029.txt,16,Mutadis mutandis_comma_ analogous interpretations must be given to 5 through 7 .
E87-1029.txt,17,By definition 3 HA CA in HF CF HA CA of 4 must be a sign it is the active part of the functor.
E87-1029.txt,18,The final concatenated sign is obtained by stripping the active part of the functor as instantiated by the argument.
E87-1029.txt,20,To resume The whole model is based on  one unique operation concatenation between adjacent constituauts. one unique process to control the flow of information and to verify conditions unification. similar ways to combine a functor and its argument to give a resulting sign.
E87-1029.txt,21,The French sentence simple verbs They accept left placed arguments as clitics and rigth placed ones as lexical ones . composed verbal forms No argument can be inserted between the auxiniary and the participle form.
E87-1029.txt,22,Whereas in English only one auxiliary is used to construct perfect tenses_comma_ French uses avo r and tre depending on the main verb.
E87-1029.txt,23,Furthermore_comma_ tre is also used for passive constructions.
E87-1029.txt,24,The most important problem_comma_ however_comma_ is due to the agreement of the past participle with the subject of the main verb when used with tre_comma_ but with the objectonly if it precedes the auxiliary when used with avoir.
E87-1029.txt,25,However_comma_ we succeeded to maintain a single lexical entry for a verb_comma_ allowing for the different order of arguments.
E87-1029.txt,26,This is made possible by the .
E87-1034.txt,1,paper discusses the consequences of allowing discontinuous constituents in syntactic representions and phrase structure rules_comma_ and the resulting complications for a standard parser of phrase structure grammar. It is argued_comma_ first_comma_ that discontinuous constituents seem inevitable in a phrase structure grammar which is acceptable from a semantic point of view.
E87-1034.txt,2,It is shown that tree like constituent structures with discontinuities can be given a precise definition which makes them just as acceptable for syntactic representation as ordinary trees.
E87-1034.txt,3,However_comma_ the formulation of phrase structure rules that generate such structures entails quite intricate problems.
E87-1034.txt,4,The notions .of linear precedence and adjacency are reexamined_comma_ and the concept of n place adjacency sequence is introduced.
E87-1034.txt,5,Finally _comma_ the resulting form of phrase structure grammar_comma_ called Discontinuous Phrase Structure Grammar is shown to be parsable by an algorithm for context free parsing with relatively minor adaptations.
E87-1034.txt,6,The paper describes the adaptations in the chart parser which was implemented as part of the TENDUM dialogue system.
E87-1034.txt,8,Phrase structure discontinuity grammar and Context free phrase structure grammars PSGs have always been popular in computational linguistics and in the theory of programming languages because of their technical and conceptual simplicity and their well established efficient parsability Shell_comma_ 1976 Tomita_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1034.txt,9,In theoretical linguistics_comma_ it was generally believed until recently that natural language competence cannot be characterized adequately by a context free grammar_comma_ especially in view of agreement phenomena and discontinuities see e.g. Postal_comma_ 1964 .
E87-1034.txt,10,However_comma_ in the early eighties Gazdar and others revived an idea_comma_ due to Harman 1963 _comma_ of formulating phrase structure rules not in terms of monadic category symbols_comma_ but in terms of feature bundles.
E87-1034.txt,11,With this richer conception of PSG it is not at all obvious whether natural languages can be described by context free grammars see e .g . Pullum_comma_ 1984 .
E87-1034.txt,12,Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar GPSG Gazdar et al._comma_ 1985 _comma_ represents a recent attempt to provide a theoretically acceptable account of natural language syntax in the form of a phrase structure grammar.
E87-1034.txt,13,Apart from being important in its own right_comma_ phrase structure grammar also plays an important part in more complex grammar formalisms that have been developed in linguistics in classical Transformational Generative Grammar the base component was assumed to be a PSG in Lexical Functional Grammar a PSG is supposed to generate c structures_comma_ and in Functional Uni f ication Grammar context free rules generate the input structures for the unification operation Kay_comma_ 1979 .
E87-1034.txt,14,Phrase structure grammar has one more attractive side_comma_ apart from its technical conceptual simplicity and its computational efficiency_comma_ namely that it seems to fit the semantic requirement of compositionality very well.
E87-1034.txt,15,The compositionality principle is the thesis that the meaning of a natural language expression is determined by the combination of a the meanings of its parts b its syntactic structure.
E87-1034.txt,16,This entails_comma_ for a grammar which associates meanings with the expressions of the language_comma_ the requirement that the syntactic rules should characterize the internal structure of every expression in a meaningful way_comma_ which allows the computation of its meaning.
E87-1034.txt,17,In this way_comma_ semantic considerations can be used to prefer one syntactic analysis to another.
E87-1034.txt,18,PSGs area useful tool for the formulation of syntactic rules that meet this requirement_comma_ as phrase structure rules by their very nature provide a recursive description of the constituent structure 203 I 2 3 4 5 6 Leo is harder gegaan dan ooit tevoren Leo has been going faster than ever before 7 Ik hob een auto gekocht met 5 deuren I have bought a car with 5 doors 8 Ik hoot dat Jan Marie de kinderen de hond heeft helpen leren uitlaten I hear that John has helped Mary to teach the kids to walk the dog John talked_comma_ of course_comma_ about politics Which children did Anne expect to get a present from
E87-1034.txt,19,This was a better movie than I expected Wake me up at seven thirty i il one of your cousins come who moved to Denmark
E87-1034.txt,20,These examples do not represent a single class of linguistic phenomena_comma_ and it is doubtful whether they should all be handled by means of the same techniques.
E87-1034.txt,21,1o Sentence I _comma_ which has been discussed extensively in the literature_comma_ presents a problem for any analysis in terms of adjacent constituents_comma_ since the parenthetical of course divides the verb phrase talked about politics into non adjacent parts.
E87-1034.txt,22,This means that we are forc e d to e i the r consider the parenthetical as part of the VP_comma_ as Ross 1973 has suggested_comma_ or as a constituent at sentence level_comma_ as has been suggested by Emonds 1976 1979 .
E87-1034.txt,23,In the latter case_comma_ the sentence is analysed as consisting of the embedded sentence John talked _comma_ with of course and about politics as specifiers at sentence level.
E87-1034.txt,24,McCawley 1982 provides detailed arguments showing that both suggestions are inadequate which seems intuitively obvious_comma_ from a semantic point of view _comma_ and suggests_comma_ instead_comma_ the syntactic representation 9 .
E87-1034.txt,25,9 John talked This is of course no longer an ordinary tree structure_comma_ but should that be a reason to reject it
E87-1034.txt,26,McCawley takes the view that we should simply not be afraid of constituent structures like 9 .
E87-1034.txt,27,We will return to this suggestion below.
E87-1034.txt,28,Example 2 represents a different c l a s s o f phenomena_comma_ which are conveniently thought of in terms of movements of parts of phrases.
E87-1034.txt,29,In this example_comma_ the NP which children can be thought of as having moved out of the PP from which children _comma_ of which only the preposition has been left behind.
E87-1034.txt,30,In order to deal with such cases_comma_ in GPSG a special type of syntactic categories have be e n i n t rod uced_comma_ called slash categories For instance_comma_ the category PP NP is assigned to a prepositional phrase which misses an NP.
E87-1034.txt,31,In the present example_comma_ this category would be assigned to from .
E87-1034.txt,32,The assumption that an NP is missing propagates to higher nodes in the syntactic tree which the phrase structure rules construct for the sentence_comma_ until it is acknowledged at the top level.
E87-1034.txt,33,Diagram 10 illustrates this.
E87-1034.txt,34,S of complex expressions down to their smallest meaningful parts.
E87-1034.txt,35,However_comma_ PSG has one property that limits its applicability in describing constituent structure in natural language_comma_ namely that phrase structure rules assume the constituents of an expression to correspond to adjacent substrings.
E87-1034.txt,36,In natural language it happens quite often_comma_ however_comma_ that the constituents of an expression are not adjacent.
E87-1034.txt,37,The English and Dutch example sentences I 8 illustrate this.
E87-1034.txt,38,In 2 7 we see examples of major phrases_comma_ made up of parts that are not adjacent so called discontinuous constituents.
E87-1034.txt,39,We have discontinuous noun phrases in 5 and 7 _comma_ a discontinuous adjective phrase in 3 _comma_ discontinuous verb phrases in 1 and 4 _comma_ and a discontinuous adverb phrase in 6 .
E87-1034.txt,41,204 11 S which children did nn get ifts fr m The technique of using phrases that miss some constituent cannot be used for at least some of the examples 3 8 _comma_ such as 5 and 7 .
E87-1034.txt,42,In both these sentences the discontinuous NP contains a full fledged NP_comma_ which cannot sensibly be said to miss the relative clause or prepositional phrase that occurs later in the sentence.
E87-1034.txt,43,Whatever techniques may be invented to deal with such cases_comma_ it seems obvious that a grammar which recognizes and describes discontinuities in natural language sentences is a more suitable basis for semantic interpretation than one that squeezes constituent structures in a form in which they cannot be represented.
E87-1034.txt,44,It therefore seems worth investigating the viability of tree like structures with discontinuities_comma_ like 9 and 11 .
E87-1034.txt,46,Trees with discontinuities If we want to represent the situation that a phrase P has constituents A and C_comma_ while there is an intervening phrase B_comma_ we must allow the node corresponding to P to dominate the A and C nodes without dominating the B_comma_ even though this node is located between the A and C nodes 12 P A B C One consequence of allowing such discontinuities is that our structures get crossing branches_comma_ if we still want all nodes to be connected to the top node 10 and 11 illustrate this.
E87-1034.txt,47,In what respects exactly do these structures differ from ordinary trees
E87-1034.txt,48,McCawley 1982 has tried to answer this question_comma_ suggesting a formal definition for trees with discontinuities by amending the definition of a tree.
E87-1034.txt,49,A tree is often defined as a set of elements_comma_ called nodes _comma_ on which two relations are defined_comma_ immediate dominance D and linear precedence _comma_ which are required to have certain properties to the effect that a tree has exactly one root node_comma_ which dominates every other node immediately or indirectly that every node in a tree has exactly one mother node_comma_ etc. see e.g. Wall_comma_ 1972 .
E87-1034.txt,50,Given the relations of immediate dominance and linear precedence_comma_ dominance is defined as the reflexive and transitive closure D of D_comma_ and adjacency as linear precedence without intervening nodes.
E87-1034.txt,51,A node in a tree is called terminal if it does not dominate any other node the terminal nodes in a tree are totally ordered by the relation.
E87-1034.txt,52,For nonterminal nodes the precedence relation satisfies the requirement that x y if and only if every node dominated by x precedes every node dominated by y.
E87-1034.txt,53,Formally 13 for any two nodes x and y in the node set of a tree_comma_ x y if and only if for all nodes u and v_comma_ if x dominates u and y dominates v_comma_ then u v.
E87-1034.txt,54,Part of the definition of a tree is also the stipulation that any two nodes either dominate or precede one another 14 for any two nodes x and y in the node set of a tree_comma_ either x D y_comma_ or y D x_comma_ or x y_comma_ or y x.
E87-1034.txt,55,This stipulation has the effect of excluding discontinuities in a tree_comma_ for suppose a node x would dominate nodes y and z without having a dominance relation with node w_comma_ where y w z.
E87-1034.txt,56,By 14 _comma_ either x w or w x.
E87-1034.txt,57,But x dominates a node to the right of w_comma_ so by 13 x does not precede w and w is to the right of a node dominated by x_comma_ so w does not precede x either.
E87-1034.txt,58,McCawley s definition of trees with discontinuities comes down to dropping the condition that any two nodes should either dominate one another or have a left right relation.
E87-1034.txt,59,Instead_comma_ he proposes the weaker condition that a node has no precedence relation to any node that it dominates 15 for any two nodes x and y in the node set of a tree_comma_ if x D y then neither x y nor y x.
E87-1034.txt,60,We shall call a node u_comma_ situated between daughters of a node x without being dominated by x_comma_ internal context of X.
E87-1034.txt,61,205 McCawley s definition of trees with discontinuities is inaccurate in several respects however_comma_ his general idea is certainly correct trees with discontinuities can be defined essentially by relaxing condition 14 in the definition of trees.
E87-1034.txt,62,However_comma_ this is only the beginning of what needs to be done.
E87-1034.txt,63,The next question is how discontinuous trees can be produced by phrase structure rules.
E87-1034.txt,64,This question_comma_ which is not addressed by McCawley_comma_ is far from trivial and turns out to have interesting consequences for the notion of adjacency in discontinuous tre es.
E87-1034.txt,66,Adjacency in phrase structure rules for discontinuous constituents A phrase structure rule rewrites a constituent into a sequence of pairwise adjacent constituents.
E87-1034.txt,67,This means that we need a notion of adjacency in discontinuous trees_comma_ for which the obvious definition_comma_ given the relation_comma_ would seem to be 16 two nodes x and y in the node set of a tree are adjacent if and only if x y and there is no z such that x z y.
E87-1034.txt,68,We shall write x y to indicate that x and y are adjacent or neighbours .
E87-1034.txt,69,A moment s reflection shows that this notion of adjacency unfortunately does not help us in formulating rules that could do a n y thi n g w i t h in t e rnal context constituents.
E87-1034.txt,70,The following example illustrates this.
E87-1034.txt,71,Suppose we want to generate the discontinuous tree structure 17 VP k Wake your friend up To generate the top node_comma_ we need a rule combining the V and the NP_comma_ like 18 VP  V NP Since the V dominates nodes at either side of the NP_comma_ however_comma_ there is no left right order between the NP and V nodes_comma_ leave alone a neighbour relation.
E87-1034.txt,72,For the same reason there would be no left right relation between overlapping discontinuous constituents_comma_ as in 19 .
E87-1034.txt,73,These deficiencies can be remedied by replacing clause 14 in the definition of a tree by the more general clause 20 .
E87-1034.txt,74,19 VP g NP Wake the man up who lives next door.
E87-1034.txt,75,20 A nonterminal node x in a tree is to the left of a node y in the tree if and only if x s leftmost daughter is left of y s leftmost daughter.
E87-1034.txt,76,We refrain here from a formal definition of leftmost daughter node_comma_ which is intuitively obvious. Note that 20 is indeed a generalization of the usual notion of precedence in trees_comma_ which could also be defined by 20 .
E87-1034.txt,77,The recursion in 20 comes to an end since the terminal nodes are required to be totally ordered.
E87-1034.txt,78,It should also be noted that 20 is not consistent with clause 14 by 2 _comma_ we do get a precedence relation between a node and its daughter nodes except the leftmost one and internal context nodes.
E87-1034.txt,79,This is not quite unreasonable.
E87-1034.txt,80,In 21 _comma_ for example_comma_ we do want that X Y_comma_ and 21 X A B Y C since Y C_comma_ that X C_comma_ but not that X B.
E87-1034.txt,81,We therefore adapt clause 14 to the effect that a mother node only precedes internal context nodes and daughter nodes which have internal context nodes to their left.
E87-1034.txt,82,Formally 22 For any nodes x and z in the node set N of a tree_comma_ if x D z and there are no nodes u_comma_v in N such that x D u_comma_ not x D v_comma_ and u v z_comma_ then neither x z nor z x.
E87-1034.txt,84,The  symbol represents the notion of adjacency_comma_ defined as before but now on the basis of te revised precedence relation  206 24 Two nodes x and y in a tree are adjacent if and only if x y and there is no node z in the tree such that x z y.
E87-1034.txt,85,Upon closer inspection_comma_ the neighbour relation defined in this way is unsatisfactory_comma_ however_comma_ as the following example illustrates.
E87-1034.txt,86,Suppose we want to generate the following part of a tree structure 25 S A B C D E To generate the S node_comma_ we would like to write a phrase structure rule that rewrites S into its constituents_comma_ like 26 26 S  P Q E However_comma_ this rule would be of no help here_comma_ since P_comma_ Q and E do not form a sequence of adjacency pairs_comma_ as Q and E are not adjacent according to our definition.
E87-1034.txt,88,Moreover_comma_ there seems to be something fundamentally wrong_comma_ since the C and D nodes are on the one hand internal context for the S node_comma_ according to rule 27 _comma_ while on the other hand they are also dominated by S.
E87-1034.txt,89,That is_comma_ these nodes are both real constituents of S and internal context of S.
E87-1034.txt,90,To remedy this_comma_ we introduce a new concept of adjacency sequence_comma_ which generalizes the traditional notion of a sequence of adjacency pairs.
E87-1034.txt,91,The definition goes as follows 28 A sequence a_comma_ b_comma_ ..._comma_ n is an n place adjacency sequence if and only if i every pair i_comma_j in the sequence is either an adjacency pair or is connected by a sequence of adjacency pairs of which all members are a constituent of some element in the subsequence a_comma_ b_comma_..._comma_ i ii the elements in the sequenc do not share any constituents. . For example_comma_ in the structure 25 the triple P_comma_ Q_comma_ E is an adjacency sequence since P_comma_ Q is an adjacency pair and Q and E are connected by the sequence of adjacency pairs Q C D E_comma_ with C and D constituents of P and Q_comma_ respectively.
E87-1034.txt,92,Another example of an adjacency sequence in 25 is the triple P_comma_ B_comma_ D .
E87-1034.txt,93,The triple P_comma_ B_comma_ C _comma_ on the other hand_comma_ is not an adjacency sequence_comma_ since P and C share the constituent C.
E87-1034.txt,94,The use of this notion of adjacency sequence is now that the sequence of constituents_comma_ into which a nonterminal is rewritten by a phrase structure rule_comma_ forms an adjacency sequence in this sense.
E87-1034.txt,95,The phrase structure grammar consisting of rules of this kind we call Discontinuous Phrase Structure Grammar or DPSG. j It may be worth emphasizing that this notion of phrase structure rule is a generalization of the usual notion_comma_ since an adjacency sequence as defined by 28 subsumes the usual notion of sequence of adjacency pairs.
E87-1034.txt,96,We have also seen that trees with discontinuities are a generalization of the traditional tree concept.
E87-1034.txt,97,Therefore_comma_ phrase structure rules of the familiar sort coincide with DPSG rules without discontinuous constituents_comma_ and they produce the familiar sort of trees without discontinuities .
E87-1034.txt,98,In other words_comma_ DPSG rules can simply be added to a classical PSG including GPSG _comma_  ith the result that the grammar generates trees with discontinuities for sentences with discontinuous constituents_comma_ while doing everything else as before. 4. DPSG and parsing From a parser s point of view_comma_ a definition of adjacency as given in 24 is not sufficient_comma_ since it only applies to nodes within the context of a tree.
E87-1034.txt,99,A parser has the job of constructing such a set from a collection of substructures that may or may not fit together to form one or more trees for the entire sentence.
E87-1034.txt,100,Whether a number of subtrees fit together is not so easy if the end product may be a tree with discontinuities_comma_ since the adjacency relation defined by 20 and 24 allows neighbouring nodes to have common daughters.
E87-1034.txt,101,This is clearly undesirable.
E87-1034.txt,102,We therefore modify the definition 20 of adjacency by adding the requirement that two substructures or their top nodes can only have a precedence relation if they do not share any constituents 207 29 A node x in a collection of substructures for a potential tree possibly with discontinuities is to the left of a node y in the same qollection if and only if x s leftmost daughter is left of y s leftmost daughter_comma_ and there is no node z which is shared by x and y.
E87-1034.txt,103,If the nodes x and y in this definition belong to the same tree_comma_ the additional requirement that x and y do not share any constituent is automatically satisfied_comma_ due to the single mother condition.
E87-1034.txt,104,A parser for DPSG meets certain complications which do not arise in context free parsing.
E87-1034.txt,105,To see these complications_comma_ we consider what would happen when a chart parser for context free parsing see Winograd_comma_ 1983 is applied to DPSG.
E87-1034.txt,106,Context free chart parsing is a matter of fitting adjoining pieces together in a chart.
E87-1034.txt,107,For example_comma_ consider the grammar 30 S  VP NP NP  DET N VP  V For the input V DET N _comma_ a chart parser begins by initializing the chart as follows 31 1 2 3 4 Given the arc V 1_comma_2 in the chart_comma_ we look up all those rules which have a free V as the first constituent.
E87-1034.txt,108,These rules are placed in a separate list_comma_ the activerule list .
E87-1034.txt,109,We bind the V s in these rules to the V 1_comma_2 arc_comma_ i.e. we establish links between them.
E87-1034.txt,110,When all constituents in a rule are bound_comma_ the rule is applied.
E87-1034.txt,111,In this case_comma_ the VP I_comma_2 will be built.
E87-1034.txt,112,This procedure is repeated for the new VP node.
E87-1034.txt,113,When nothing more can be done_comma_ we move on in the chart.
E87-1034.txt,114,The final result in this example is the chart 32 .
E87-1034.txt,115,32 VP NP I 2 3 4 When we use DPSG rules and follow the same procedure_comma_ we run into difficulties.
E87-1034.txt,116,Consider the example grammar 33 .
E87-1034.txt,118,The VP will activate the S rule_comma_ but this rule will not be applied since the NP does not have a binding.
E87-1034.txt,119,And even if it did_comma_ the rule would not be applicable as the VP I_comma_5 and the NP 2_comma_4 are not adjoining in the traditional sense.
E87-1034.txt,120,In the next section we describe the provisions_comma_ added to a standard chart parser in order to deal with these difficulties.
E87-1034.txt,122,A modified chart parser for DPSG 5.1 Finding all applicable rules To make sure that the parser finds all applicable rules of a DPSG_comma_ the following addition was made to the parsing algorithm.
E87-1034.txt,123,If a rule with internal context is applied_comma_ we first follow the standard procedure subsequently we go through all those rules that appear on the activerule list as the result of applying the standard procedure_comma_ giving bindings to those free constituents that correspond in category to the context element s in the rule that was applied.
E87-1034.txt,124,In the case of 33 _comma_ this means that just before application of the VP rule after the PART has been bound _comma_ we have the active rule list 34 .
E87-1034.txt,125,Underlining indicates that a constituent is bound .
E87-1034.txt,127,The standard procedure will add one rule to this list_comma_ namely S  VP NP.
E87-1034.txt,129,The S arc is now built in the chart_comma_ which does not cause any new rules to be added to the active rule list.
E87-1034.txt,130,There are no free S s 208 in the old active rule list either_comma_ which should be given a binding.
E87-1034.txt,131,So_comma_ we can look for other rules containing a free NP.
E87-1034.txt,132,There is one such rule_comma_ the second in 35 _comma_ but this one will be neglected because it was already present in the rule list before see 34 .
E87-1034.txt,133,Note that it is essential that this rule is neglected_comma_ as there is already a version of the VP rule on the active rule list containing an NP with the s a me binding as the context element.
E87-1034.txt,134,It may also be noted that we have combined constituents in this example that are not adjoining in the traditional sense i.e._comma_ in the sense of successive vertex numbers .
E87-1034.txt,135,In particular_comma_ we have applied the rule S  VP I_comma_5 NP 2_comma_4 .
E87-1034.txt,136,In a case like this_comma_ where the vertex numbers indicate that the constituents in a rule are overlapping_comma_ we must test whether these constituents form an adjacency sequence.
E87-1034.txt,137,This test is described below.
E87-1034.txt,138,5.2 The adjacency sequence test In order to make sure that only consituents are combined that form an adjacency sequence_comma_ the parser keeps track of daughter nodes and internal context in a so called construction list _comma_ which is added to each arc in the chart internal context nodes are marked as such in these lists.
E87-1034.txt,139,Whether two or more nodes share a constituent_comma_ in the sense of common domination_comma_ is easily detected with the help of these lists.
E87-1034.txt,140,By organizing these lists in a particular way_comma_ moreover_comma_ they can also be used to determine whether a sequence of constituents is an adjacency sequence in the sense of definition 28 .
E87-1034.txt,141,This is achieved by ordering the elements in construction lists in such a way that an element is always either dominated by its predecessor in the list_comma_ or is internal context of it_comma_ or is a right neighbour of it.
E87-1034.txt,143,The rule S  P Q E is now applicable_comma_ since the construction list for S would be the result of merging P s and Q s lists with that of E_comma_ which is simply E _comma_ with the result S A_comma_ B_comma_ C_comma_ D_comma_ E .
E87-1034.txt,144,From this list_comma_ it can be concluded that the triple P_comma_ Q_comma_ E is an adjacency sequence_comma_ since P_comma_ Q is an adjacency pair since P s leftmost daughter_comma_ i.e. A_comma_ is adjacent to Q s leftmost daughter_comma_ i.e. B_comma_ as can be seen also in the construction lists _comma_ and Q and E are separated in S s construction list by the adjacency pair C_comma_ D _comma_ whose elemehts are both daughters of P.
E87-1034.txt,148,The currently implemented version of the DPSG parser is in fact based on a more restricted notion of adjacency sequence_comma_ where two constituents are viewed as sharing a constituent z not only if they both dominate z_comma_ but also if one of them dominates z and the other has an internal context node that dominates z see note I .
E87-1034.txt,149,This means that structures like 38 are not generated_comma_ since P and T would share node B_comma_ and T and R would share node C.
E87-1034.txt,150,38 T A B C D E Note that a structure like 38 would be an ill formed tree_comma_ since the nodes B and C violate the single mother condition_comma_ and the nodes Q and R_comma_ moreover_comma_ are not connected to the root node.
E87-1034.txt,151,To deal with this more restricted notion of adjacency sequence_comma_ the administration in the construction lists is actually slightly more complicated than described above.
E87-1034.txt,153,Conclusions Our findings concerning the use of discontinuous constituents in syntactic representations_comma_ phrase structure rule_comma_ and parsers may be summarized as follows.
E87-1034.txt,155,Tr e e 1 i ke s t r uctures with discontinuities can be given a precise definition_comma_ which makes them formally as acceptable for use in syntactic 209 representation as the familiar ord tree structures.
E87-1034.txt,157,Discontinuous constituents can be allowed in phrase structure rules generating trees with discontinuities_comma_ provided we give a suitable generalization to the notion of adjacency.
E87-1034.txt,159,Trees with discontinuities are generalizations of ordinary tree structures_comma_ and phrase structure rules with discontinuous constituents are generalizations of ordinary phrase structure rules.
E87-1034.txt,160,Both concepts can be added to ordinary phrase structure grammars_comma_ including GPSG_comma_ with the effect that such grammars generate trees with discontinuities for sentences with discontinuous constituents_comma_ while everything else remains the same.
E87-1034.txt,162,Phrase structure rules with discontinuities can be handled by a chart parser for context free grammar by making two additions in the administration one in the active rule list for rules containing a discontinuous element to make sure that no parse is overlooked_comma_ and one in the arcs in the chart to check the generalized adjacency relation.
E87-1034.txt,163,NOTES I In this paper_comma_ sharing a constituent has been taken simply as common domination of that constituent.
E87-1034.txt,164,An interesting issue is whether we should take sharing a constituent to include the following situation.
E87-1034.txt,165,A node x dominates a constituent z_comma_ while another node y is related to z in such a way that z is dominated by a node w which is internal context for y.
E87-1034.txt,166,And still more complex definitions of constituent sharing are conceivable within the framework of DPSG. Decisions on this point turn out to have far reaching consequences for the generative capacity of DPSG.
E87-1034.txt,167,With the simple notion of sharing used in this paper_comma_ it is easily proved that DPSG is more powerful than context free PSG_comma_ while further restrictions on the precedence relation in terms of constituent sharing may have the effect of making DPSG weakly equivalent to context free grammar.

E87-1038.txt,1,environment built around WEDNESDAY 2_comma_ a chart based parser is introduced. The environment is in particular oriented towards exploring dynamic aspects of parsing.
E87-1038.txt,2,It includses a number of specialized tools that consent an easy_comma_ graphics based interaction with the parser.
E87-1038.txt,3,It is shown in particular how a combination of the characteristics of the parser based on the lexicon and on dynamic unification and of the environment allow a nonspecialized user to explore heuristics that may alter the basica control of the system.
E87-1038.txt,4,In this way_comma_ for instance_comma_ a psycholinguist may explore ideas on human parsing strategies_comma_ or a language engineer may find useful heuristics for parsing within a particular application.
E87-1038.txt,6,Computer based environments for the linguist are conceived as sophisticated workbenches_comma_ built on AI workstations around a specific parser_comma_ where the linguist can try out his her ideas about a grammar for a certain natural language.
E87-1038.txt,7,In doing so_comma_ he she can take advantage of rich and easy to use graphic interfaces that know about linguistics.
E87-1038.txt,8,Of course behind all this lies the idea that cooperation with linguists will provide better results in NLP.
E87-1038.txt,9,To substantiate this assumption it may be recalled that some of the most interesting recent ideas on syntax have been developed by means of joint contributions from linguists and computational linguists.
E87-1038.txt,11,Instances of the tools introduced above are the LFG environment_comma_ which was probably the first of its kind_comma_ an environment built by Ron Kaplan for LexicalFunctional Grammars_comma_ DPATR_comma_ built by Lauri Karttunen and conceived as an environment that would suit linguists of a number of different schools all committed to a view of parsing as a process that makes use of an unification algorithm.
E87-1038.txt,12,We have developed an environment with a somewhat different purpose.
E87-1038.txt,13,Besides a number of tools for entering data in graphic mode and inspecting resulting structures_comma_ it provides a means for experimenting with strategies in the course of the parsing process.
E87-1038.txt,14,We think that this can be a valuable tool for gaining insight in the cognitive aspects of language processing as well as for tailoring the behaviour of the processor when used with a particular sub language.
E87-1038.txt,15,In this way an attempt can be made to answer basic questions when following a nondeterministic approach what heuristics to apply when facing a certain choice point_comma_ what to do when facing a failure point_comma_ i.e. which of the pending processes to activate_comma_ taking account of information resulting from the failure
E87-1038.txt,16,Of course this kind of environment makes sense only because the parser it works on has some characteristics that make it a psychologically interesting realization.
E87-1038.txt,18,Motivation of the parser We shall classify psychologically motivated parsers in three main categories.
E87-1038.txt,19,First those that embody a strong claim on the specification of the general control structure of the human parsing mechanism.
E87-1038.txt,20,The authors usually consider the level of basic control of the system as the level they are simulating and are not concerned with more particular heuristics.
E87-1038.txt,22,234 Connectionist parsers are also instances of this category.
E87-1038.txt,24,Our parser lies between the second and the third of the above categories.
E87-1038.txt,25,The parser is seen as a nondeterministic apparatus that disambiguates and gives a shallow interpretation and an incremental functional representation of each processed fragment of the sentence.
E87-1038.txt,26,The state of the parser is supposed to be cognitively meaningful at every moment ofthe process.
E87-1038.txt,27,Furthermore_comma_ in particular_comma_ we are concerned with aspects of flexible word ordering.
E87-1038.txt,28,This phenomenon is specially relevant in Italian_comma_ where_comma_ for declarative sentences_comma_ Subject Verb Object is only the most likely order the other five permutations of Subject Verb and Object may occur as well.
E87-1038.txt,29,We shall briefly describe the parser and its environment and_comma_ by way of example_comma_ illustrate its behaviour in analyzing oscillating sentences_comma_ i.e. sentences in which one first perceives a fragment in one way_comma_ then changes one s mind and takes it in a different way_comma_ then_comma_ as further input comes in_comma_ going back to the previous pattern and posssibly continuing like this till the end of the sentence .
E87-1038.txt,32,A word reading includes a semantic representation of the word_comma_ in the form of a semantic net shred static syntactic information_comma_ including the category_comma_ features_comma_ indication of linguistic functions that are bound to particular nodes in the net.
E87-1038.txt,33,One particular specification is the Main node_comma_ head of the syntactic constituent the word occurs in dynamic syntactic information_comma_ including impulses to connect pieces of semantic information_comma_ guided by syntactic constraints.
E87-1038.txt,34,Impulses look for fillers on a given search space usually a substring .
E87-1038.txt,35,They have alternatives_comma_ for instance the word TELL has an impulse to merge its object node with the main of either an NP or a subordinate clause .
E87-1038.txt,36,An alternative includes a contextual condition of applicability_comma_ a category_comma_ features_comma_ marking_comma_ side effects through which_comma_ for example_comma_ coreference between subject of a subordinate clause and a function of the main clause can be indicated .
E87-1038.txt,37,Impulses may also be directed to a different search space than the normal one see below measures of likelihood.
E87-1038.txt,38,These are measures that are used for deriving an overall measure of likelihood of a partial analysis.
E87-1038.txt,39,Measures are included for the likelihood of that particular reading of the word and for aspects attached to an impulse a for one particular alternative b for the relative position the filler c for the overall necessity of finding a filler. a characterization of idioms involving that word.
E87-1038.txt,41,The only other data are in the form of simple non augmented transition networks that only provide restrictions on search spaces where impulses can look for fillers.
E87-1038.txt,42,In more traditional words it deals with the distribution of constituents.
E87-1038.txt,43,A distinguishing symbol_comma_ EXP_comma_ indicates that only the occurrence of something expected by preceding words i.e. for which an impulse was set up will allow the transition.
E87-1038.txt,45,What is relevant here is the fact that edges correspond to search spaces.
E87-1038.txt,46,Edges are complex data structures provided with a rich amount of information including a semantic interpretation of the fragment_comma_ syntactic data_comma_ pending impulses_comma_ an overall measure of likelihood_comma_ etc. Data on an edge are unified dynamieally as indicated below An agenda is provided which includes four kinds of tasks lexical tasks_comma_ traoersal tasks_comma_ insertion tasks_comma_ virtual tasks.
E87-1038.txt,47,A lexieal task specifies a possible reading of a word to be inserted in the chart.
E87-1038.txt,48,A traversal task specifies an active edge and an inactive edge that can extend it.
E87-1038.txt,49,An insertion task specifies a nondeterministie unification act_comma_ and a virtual task involves extension of an edge to include an inactive edge far away in the string used for long distance dependencies .
E87-1038.txt,52,This modality of scheduling by hand is complemented by a series of counters that provide control over the penetrance of these strategies.
E87-1038.txt,53,The penetrance of a nondeterministic algorithm is the ratio between the steps that lead to the solution and the steps that are carried out as a whole in trying to obtain the solution. Of course this measure is included between 0 and 1. Dynamically_comma_ one tries to find sensible strategies_comma_ by interacting with the agenda.
E87-1038.txt,54,When_comma_ after experimenting formalizable heuristics have been tried out_comma_ they can be introduced permanently into the system through a given specialized function.
E87-1038.txt,55,This is the only place where some knowledge of LISP and of the internal structure ofWEDNESAY 2 is required.
E87-1038.txt,57,An example of exploration oscillating sentences We shall now briefly discuss a processing example that we have been able to understand using the environment mentioned above.
E87-1038.txt,58,The following example is a good instance of flexibility and parsing problems present in Italian a Napoli preferisco Romaa Milano.
E87-1038.txt,59,The complete sentence reads while in Naples I prefer Rome to Milan .
E87-1038.txt,60,The problem arises during the parsing process with the fact that the to argument of prefer in Italian may occur before the verb_comma_ and the locative preposition in is a_comma_ the same word as the marking preposition corresponding to to .
E87-1038.txt,61,238 The reader hearer first takes a Napoli as an adverbial location _comma_ then_comma_ as the verb preferisc9 is perceived_comma_ a Napoli is clearly reinterpreted as an argument of the verb_comma_ with a sense of surprise .
E87-1038.txt,62,As the sentence proceeds after the object Rorna_comma_ the new word a_ causes things to change again and we go back with a sense of surprise to the first hypothesis.
E87-1038.txt,63,The following things should be noted when this second reconsideration takes place_comma_ we feel the surprise_comma_ but this does not cause us to reconsider the sentence_comma_ we only go back adding more to an hypothesis that we were already working at the surprise seems to be caused not by a heavy computational load_comma_ but by a sudden readjustment of the weights of the hypotheses.
E87-1038.txt,64,In a sense it is a matter of memory_comma_ rather than computation.
E87-1038.txt,65,We have been in a position to get WEDNESDAY 2 to perform naturally in such situations_comma_ taking advantage of the environment.
E87-1038.txt,66,The following simple heuristics were found a try solutions that satisfy the impulses if there are alternatives consider likelihoods b maintain viscosity prefer the path you are already following and c follow the alternative that yields the edge with the greatest likelihood_comma_ among edges of comparable lengths.
E87-1038.txt,67,The likelihood of an edge depends on 1 the likelihood of the included edges 2 the level ofobligatoriness of the filled impulses 3 the likelihood of a particular relative position of an argument in the string 4 the likelihood of that transition in the network_comma_ given the previous transition.
E87-1038.txt,68,The critical points in the sentence are the following note that we distinguish between a PP and a marked NP possible argument of a verb_comma_ where the preposition has no semantics asociated i At the beginning only the PP edge is expanded_comma_ not the one including a marked NP _comma_ because of static preference for the former expressed in the lexicon and in the transition network. ii After the verb is detected on the one hand there is an edge that_comma_ if extended_comma_ would not satisfy an obligatory impulse_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ one that would possibly satisfy one .
E87-1038.txt,69,The marked NP alternative is chosen because of a of the above heuristics.
E87-1038.txt,70,iii After the object Roma when the preposition a_ comes in_comma_ the edge that may extend the sentence with a PP on the one hand_comma_ and on the other hand a cycling active edge that is a promising satisfaction for an impulse are compared.
E87-1038.txt,72,The object is already there_comma_ analyzed for the other reading and does not need to be reanalyzed.
E87-1038.txt,73,So a Milano is taken as the filler for the impulse and the analysis is concluded properly.
E87-1038.txt,76,Conclusions We have introduced an environment built around WEDNESDAY 2_comma_ a nondeterministic parser_comma_ oriented towards experimenting with dynamic strategies.
E87-1038.txt,77,The combination of interesting theories and such tools realizes both meanings of the word experimental 1 something that implements new ideas in a prototype 2 something built for the sake of making experiments.
E87-1038.txt,78,We think that this approach_comma_ possibly integrated with experiments in psycholinguistics_comma_ can help increase our understanding of parsing.
E87-1038.txt,79,Acknowledgements Federico Cecconi s help in the graphic aspects and lexicon management has been precious. .
E87-1033.txt,1,this paper we present an efficient context free CF bottom up_comma_ non deterministic parser. It is an extension of the ICA Immediate Constituent Analysis parser proposed by Grishman 1976 _comma_ and its major improvements are described.
E87-1033.txt,2,It has been designed to run Augmented Phrase Structure Grammars APSG and performs semantic interpretation in parallel with syntactic analysis.
E87-1033.txt,3,It has been implemented in Franz Lisp and runs on VAX 11 780 and_comma_ recently_comma_ also on a SUN workstation_comma_ as the main component of a transportable Natural Language Interface SAIL Sistema per I Analisi e I lnterpretazione del Linguaggio .
E87-1033.txt,4,Subsets of grammars of italian written in different formalisms and for different applications have been experimented with SAIL.
E87-1033.txt,5,In particular_comma_ a toy application has been developed in which SAIL has been used as interface to build a knowledge base in MRS Genesereth et al. 1980_comma_ Genesereth 1981 about ski paths in a ski environment_comma_ and to ask for advice about the best touristic path under specific weather and physical conditions.
E87-1033.txt,7,Many parsers for natural language have been developed in the past_comma_ which run different types of grammars.
E87-1033.txt,8,Among them_comma_ the most successful are the CF grammars_comma_ the augmented phrase structure grammars APSGs _comma_ and the semantic grammars.
E87-1033.txt,9,All of them have different characteristics and different advantages.
E87-1033.txt,10,In particular APSGs offer a natural tool for the treatment of certain natural language phenomena_comma_ such as subjectverb agreement.
E87-1033.txt,11,Semantic grammars are prone to a compositional algorithm for semantic interpretation.
E87-1033.txt,12,The aim of our work is to implement a parser which associates the full extension of an APSG to compositionality of semantics.
E87-1033.txt,13,The parser relies on the well stabilized ICA algorithm.
E87-1033.txt,14,This association allows a wide range of applications in syntactic semantic analyses together with the efficiency of a CF parser.
E87-1033.txt,16,Functional description of the parsing algorithm The parsing algorithm consists of the following modules a preprocessor a parser itself a post processor and interpreter and interacts with a dictionary_comma_ which is used by the preprocessor the grammar_comma_ used by the parser.
E87-1033.txt,17,Figure 1 shows the structure of the system we have designed.
E87-1033.txt,18,Some of the modules_comma_ such as the spelling corrector_comma_ the robusteness component_comma_ and the NL answer generator_comma_ are still being developed.
E87-1033.txt,20,The dictionary The dictionary contains the word forms _comma_ known to the interface_comma_ with the following associated information_comma_ called interpretation syntactic category semantic value syntactic features as gender_comma_ number_comma_ etc. A form can be single a single word or multiple more than one word .
E87-1033.txt,21,Multiple forms are frequent in natural language and are in general referred to as idioms .
E87-1033.txt,22,However_comma_ in semantic grammars_comma_ the use of multiple words is wider than in syntactic ones as also some simpler phrases may be more conveniently treated in the dictionary.
E87-1033.txt,23,This is the reason why multiple forms are treated by specific algorithms which optimize storage and search.
E87-1033.txt,24,196 The description of this algorithm is not the aim of this paper.
E87-1033.txt,25,Figure 2 shows an example of such a dictionary_comma_ which contains the single forms che that as conjunction _comma_ e is _comma_ noto well known and the multiple forms e noto it s well known and e noto che it s well known that .
E87-1033.txt,26,The mark EOW indicates a final state in the interpretation of the form currently being scanned.
E87-1033.txt,28,The grammar The grammar is a set of complex grammatical statements CGS _comma_ represented in BNF as follows CGS RULE EXPRESSION RULE . PRODUCTION TESTS ACTIONS PRODUCTION  LEFT SYMBOL RIGHT PATTERN LEFT SYMBOL  a non terminal symbol RIGHT PATTERN  a sequence of categories TESTS  a whatever predicate ACTIONS  a whatever action EXPRESSION  a semantic interpretation in any chosen formalism As we have already stated_comma_ the PRODUCTION s can be instantiated both with syntactic and with semantic grammars.
E87-1033.txt,29,The schema of the rule and the order of the operations are fixed_comma_ regardless of the chosen instance grammar. TESTS are evaluated before the application of a rule and can inhibit it if they fail. ACTIONS are activated after the application of a rule and perform additional structuring and structure moving.
E87-1033.txt,30,Both participate into a process of syntactic recognition and are to be considered as the syntactic augmentation of the rules.
E87-1033.txt,31,When using a semantic grammar the ACTIONS are_comma_ in general_comma_ not used. EXPRESSION s are the semantic augmentation and specify the interpretation of the sentence_comma_ for top level rules_comma_ or partial constituents_comma_ for the other rules.
E87-1033.txt,32,These two augmentations improve the syntactic power of the grammar_comma_ by adding context sensitiveness_comma_ and add a semantic relevance to the structuring of constituents_comma_ due to the one to one correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules.
E87-1033.txt,33,The set of rules of a grammar is partitioned into packets of rules sharing the same rightmost symbol of the RIGHT PATTERN of productions.
E87-1033.txt,34,This partitioning makes their application a semi deterministic process_comma_ as only a restricted set of them is tried_comma_ and no other choice is given.
E87-1033.txt,36,The preprocessor The preprocessor scans the sentence from left to right_comma_ performs the dictionary look up for each word in the input string_comma_ and returns a structure with the syntactic and semantic information taken from the dictionary.
E87-1033.txt,37,At the end of the scanning the input string has been transformed into a sequence of such lexical interpretations.
E87-1033.txt,38,The look up takes into account also the possibility that a word in input is part of a multiple form.
E87-1033.txt,40,The parser The parser is an extension of the ICA algorithm Grishman 1976 .
E87-1033.txt,41,It shares with ICA the following characteristics it performs the syntactic recognition bottorfi up_comma_ left to right_comma_ first selecting reduction sets by an integrated breadth and depth first strategy.
E87-1033.txt,42,It does not reject sentences on a syntactic basis_comma_ but it only rejects rule by rule for a given input word.
E87-1033.txt,43,If all the rules have been rejected with no success_comma_ the next word in the preprocessed string is read and the loop continues.
E87-1033.txt,44,Termination occurs in a natural way_comma_ when no more rule can be applied and the input string has come to an end it gives as output a graph of all possible parse trees the complete parse tree s is are extracted from the graph in a following step.
E87-1033.txt,45,This characterizes the algorithm as an allpath algorithm which returns all possible derivations for a sentence.
E87-1033.txt,46,Therefore_comma_ the parser is able to create structure pieces also for ill formed sentences_comma_ thus outputting_comma_ even in this case_comma_ partial analyses.
E87-1033.txt,47,This is particularly useful for diagnosis and debugging.
E87-1033.txt,48,The following are the major extensions to the basic ICA algotrithm it is designed to run an APSG_comma_ in particular it evaluates the tests before applying a rule 197 PREPROC INPUT IL USER DICTIONARY DICTIONARY CONSTRUCTOR I_comma_ l 1 POSTPARSER PARSER ANALYSIS A.

E87-1033.txt,54,The dictionary representation.
E87-1033.txt,55,198 it handles lexical ambiguities during parsing by representing them in special multiple nodes see below the partition of the rules into packets makes the selection of the rules semideterministic it carries syntactic and semantic analysis in parallel.
E87-1033.txt,57,Post processor and interpreter The graph built by the parser is the data structure out of which the parse tree is extracted by the post processor.
E87-1033.txt,58,To this end the necessary conditions are that a. there exists at least one top level node among the nodes of the graph b. at least one of the top level nodes cover the whole sentence.
E87-1033.txt,59,If one of these conditions is not met_comma_ i.e. if there is no top level node or no top level node covers the entire sentence_comma_ the analyser does not carry any interpretation but displays a message to the user_comma_ indicating the more complete partial parsing_comma_ where the parser stopped.
E87-1033.txt,60,In case of ambiguity more than one top level node covers the entire sentence and more than one semantic interpretation is proposed to the user who will select the appropriate one.
E87-1033.txt,61,If_comma_ instead_comma_ only one top level node is found_comma_ the semantic interpretation is immediately produced.
E87-1033.txt,63,Data structure and algorithm 3.1.
E87-1033.txt,64,Data structure The algorithm takes in input a preprocessed string and returns a graph of all possible parse trees.
E87-1033.txt,65,The nodes in the graph can be either terminals forms _comma_ or non terminals constituents .
E87-1033.txt,66,Nodes are identified as follows the name can be either FORMi or CONSTITUENTj_comma_ according to the type.
E87-1033.txt,67,i and j are indexes_comma_ and forms and constituents have two independent orderings a general sequence number.
E87-1033.txt,68,The following two types of structural information are associated with each node a. the annotation specifies the associated interpretation _comma_ i.e. the syntactic category of the node the label its semantic value its features.
E87-1033.txt,69,For terminal nodes_comma_ their interpretation_comma_ i.e. their annotation coincides with the interpretation associated to the form by the preprocessor.
E87-1033.txt,70,For non terminal nodes_comma_ instead_comma_ the interpretation is made during the building of the node and the applied rule gives all necessary information b. the covering structure of a node contains the information necessary to identify in the graph the subtree rooted in that node.
E87-1033.txt,71,Each node in the graph dominates a subtree and covers a part of the input_comma_ i.e. a sequence of terminal nodes.
E87-1033.txt,72,In this sequence_comma_ the form associated with the leftmost terminal node is a first form .
E87-1033.txt,73,The form immediately to the right of the form associated to rightmost terminal node is the anchor .
E87-1033.txt,74,For terminal nodes the covering structure contains the first form the node itself the anchor the next form in the input string the list of parent nodes the list of anchored nodes_comma_ i.e. the nodes which have as anchor the form itself while for non terminal nodes it consists of the first form the anchor the list of parents the list of sons.
E87-1033.txt,75,Two trees T1 and T2 are called adjacent if the anchor of T1 is the first form of T2.
E87-1033.txt,77,The algorithm The parser is a loop realized as a recursion.
E87-1033.txt,78,It scans the preprocessed string and creates a terminal node for every scanned form.
E87-1033.txt,79,As a terminal node is created_comma_ the algorithm attempts to perform at the reductions which are possible at that point.
E87-1033.txt,80,A reduction set is defined as the set of nodes N1_comma_N2 ..... Nn which are roots of adjacent subtrees and correspond_comma_ in the same order_comma_ to the RIGHT PATTERN of the examined production.
E87-1033.txt,81,If no more reduction is possible_comma_ the parser scans the next form.
E87-1033.txt,82,The loop continues until the string is exhausted.
E87-1033.txt,83,The parser operates on the graph and has in input two more data structures_comma_ i.e. the stack of the active nodes_comma_ which contains all the nodes which are to be examined this is 199 accessed with a LIFO policy the list of rule packets_comma_ which contains the rules potentially applicable on the current node.
E87-1033.txt,84,The loop starts from the first active node.
E87-1033.txt,85,Its annotation is extracted and the corresponding rule packet is selected_comma_ i.e. the one whose rightmost symbol corresponds to the current node category.
E87-1033.txt,86,The reduction sets are thus selected.
E87-1033.txt,87,A reduction set is searched by an integrated breadth and depth first strategy as alternatives are retrieved and stored all together as for breadth first search_comma_ but are then expanded one by one.
E87-1033.txt,88,The choice of the possible applicable rules is not a blind one and the rules are not all tested_comma_ but they are pre selected by their partition into packets.
E87-1033.txt,89,More than one set is possible at each step_comma_ i.e. the same rule can be applied more than once.
E87-1033.txt,90,During the matching step reduction sets are searched in parallel reductions and the building of new nodes are also carried in parallel.
E87-1033.txt,91,Once a reduction set is identified_comma_ the tests associated with the current rule are evaluated.
E87-1033.txt,92,If they succeed_comma_ the corresponding rule is applied and a new node which has as category the LEFT SYMBOL of the production is created and inserted in the active node stack.
E87-1033.txt,93,This becomes the root of the sub tree whose sons are in the reduction set.
E87-1033.txt,94,The evaluation of tests prior to entering a rule is a further improvement in efficiency.
E87-1033.txt,95,The annotation of the new nodes is now created by the execution of the actions_comma_ which insert new features for the node_comma_ and the evaluation of the expression which assigns to it a semantic value.
E87-1033.txt,96,If the tests fail_comma_ the next reduction set is processed in the same way.
E87-1033.txt,97,If there is no more reduction set_comma_ the next rule in the packet is examined until no more rule is left.
E87-1033.txt,98,When the higher level loop is resumed the next active node is examined.
E87-1033.txt,99,Termination occurs when the input is consumed and no more rule can be applied.
E87-1033.txt,101,Lexical ambiguity The algorithm can efficiently handle lexical ambiguity.
E87-1033.txt,102,For those forms which have more than one interpretation_comma_ a special annotation is provided.
E87-1033.txt,103,It contains a certain number of interpretations and each interpretation has the following form i cat sem_val  feat_name featval  where i is the ordering number of the interpretation.
E87-1033.txt,104,This structure is called multiple node .
E87-1033.txt,105,Figure 3 shows multiple nodes participating to different structures.
E87-1033.txt,107,An example The most relevant application of SAIL is its use as a NL interface towards a knowledge base about ski environments.
E87-1033.txt,108,Natural language declarations about lifts_comma_ snow and weather conditions_comma_ and classification of slopes are translated into MRS facts_comma_ and correspondently NL questions_comma_ including advice requests_comma_ are processed and inserted.

E87-1033.txt,121,Figure 4 shows the parsetree for this sentence.
E87-1033.txt,122,5.Conclusions and future developments At present the parser described above has been efficiently employed as a component of a natural language front end.
E87-1033.txt,123,The natural language is Italian and typical input sentences either give information about the possible trips paths alternative paths and their characteristics type of lift_comma_ condition of snow_comma_ weather _comma_ or have the following form Qual e II percorso migliore per andare da X a Y per uno sclatore provetto  What Is the best path from X to Y for an excellent skier Three different improvements are in progress the implementation of a spelling correcter and of a dictionary update system.The parser rejects such sentences where some forms occur that are not in the dictionary.
E87-1033.txt,124,A form not included in the dictionary cannot be distinguished from a form incorrectly typed but present in the dictionary.
E87-1033.txt,125,The two cases correspond to different situations and need distinct solutions.
E87-1033.txt,126,In the former case the defective form may be inserted in the dictionary by means of an appropriate update procedure.
E87-1033.txt,127,In the latter case the typing error may be corrected on the basis of a classification of errors compiled according to some user s model another perspective is making the parser more powerful also about more strictly linguistic phenomena as the resolution of ellipsis and anaphora finally_comma_ the identification of general semantic functions to be employed in the EXPRESSION part of the rule has been started. .
E87-1045.txt,1,at least some syntax is necessary to support semantic processing is fairly obvious. To know exactly how much syntax is needed_comma_ however_comma_ and how and when to apply it_comma_ is still an open and crucial_comma_ albeit old_comma_ question.
E87-1045.txt,2,This paper discusses the solutions used in a semantic analyser of French called SABA_comma_ developed at the University of Liege_comma_ Belgium.
E87-1045.txt,3,Specifically_comma_ we shall argue in favor of the usefulness of two syntactic processes fragmentation_comma_ which can he interleaved with semantic processing_comma_ and part of speech disambiguation_comma_ which can be performed as a preprocesslng step.
E87-1045.txt,5,The role of syntax is one of these issues in natural language processing which_comma_ albeit old and often hotly debated_comma_ have yet to receive a definitive answer.
E87-1045.txt,6,Lytinen 86 distinguishes two approaches to NI_comma_ processing.
E87-1045.txt,7,Followers of the modular approach believe usually in the autonomy of syntax and in the usefulness and costeffectiveness of a purely syntactic stage of processing.
E87-1045.txt,8,Results of this approach include the development of new grammatical formalisms Weir et al. 86 Ristad 86 _comma_ and of large syntactic grammars Jensen et al. 86 .
E87-1045.txt,9,Followers of the integrated approach_comma_ on the contrary_comma_ believe that semantics should be used as soon as possible in the parsing process.
E87-1045.txt,10,An integrated system would have no discemable stages of parsing_comma_ and would build directly a meaning representation without building an intermediate syntactic structure_comma_ tlow much syntax is needed to support this semantic processing_comma_ however_comma_ and how should the integration between syntax and semantics be done are still open and crucial questions.
E87-1045.txt,11,Some integrated systems_comma_ such as IPP Schank et al. 80 and Wilks Preference Semantics system Wilks 75 _comma_ were trying to reduce the role of syntax as much as possible.
E87-1045.txt,12,Lytinen proposes a more moderate option in which separate syntactic and semantic rules are dynamically combined at parsing time.
E87-1045.txt,13,Another kind of integration is used in Boguraev 79 _comma_ where an ATN is combined with Wilks style semantic procedures.
E87-1045.txt,14,And_comma_ lastly_comma_ one might consider that unification based grammars Shieber 86 offer yet another approach where syntactic and semantic constraints can be specified simultaneously in functional structures and satisfied in parallel.
E87-1045.txt,15,The research presented in this paper was entirely performed while the author was working at the Computer Sciences department of University of Liege_comma_ Belgium.
E87-1045.txt,16,In this paper_comma_ we wish to present our arguments in favors of integration_comma_ and then to discuss two specific technical proposals.
E87-1045.txt,17,Our general position can be stated as follows 1.
E87-1045.txt,18,That at least some form of syntax is necessary for natural language processing should be by now fairly obvious and should need no further argumentation.
E87-1045.txt,20,Syntax_comma_ however_comma_ is not a goal per se.
E87-1045.txt,21,The basic goal of NLP_comma_ at least from the point of view of AI_comma_ is to give a computer a way to understand natural language input_comma_ and this dearly requires a semantic component.
E87-1045.txt,22,The utility or necessity of syntax should only be evaluated in the light of the help it can provide to this semantic component.
E87-1045.txt,24,Grammaticality is not an essential issue_comma_ except in language generation and in specific applications like CRITIQUE Jensen et al. 86 _comma_ where the purpose is to correct the syntax and the style of a writer.
E87-1045.txt,25,For the general task of understanding_comma_ achieving comprehension_comma_ even in the face of incorrect or unusual input_comma_ is more important than enforcing some grammatical standards.
E87-1045.txt,26,And we believe that robustness is more easily achieved in the context of a semantic system than in the predictive paradigm of the grammatical approach.
E87-1045.txt,27,If we want to avoid the use of a full male grammar_comma_ the syntactic processes necessary to support the semantic module must be implemented by special dedicated procedures.
E87-1045.txt,28,This paper describe the .solutions used in a semantic analyser of French called SABA_comma_ developed at the Computer Sciences department of University of Liege_comma_ Belgium.
E87-1045.txt,29,Specifically_comma_ we shall argue in favor of two syntactic processes fragmentation_comma_ which can be interleaved with semantic processing_comma_ and part of speech disambiguation_comma_ which is usefully performed in a preprocessing step.
E87-1045.txt,30,We shall start by a brief description of the SABA system.
E87-1045.txt,32,Overview of the SABA system.
E87-1045.txt,33,SABA Semantic Analyser_comma_ Backward Approach _comma_ Binot_comma_ 1985 _comma_ Blnot et al._comma_ 1986 is a robust and portable semantic parser of written French sentences.
E87-1045.txt,34,A prototype of this parser is running in MACLISP and in ZETAI.1SP it has been tested successfully on a corpus of about 125 French sentences.
E87-1045.txt,35,This system is not based on a French grammar_comma_ but on semantic procedures which_comma_ with some syntactic support_comma_ build directly a semantic dependency graph from the natural language input.
E87-1045.txt,36,The following example is typical of the level of complexity that can be handled by the system l Le pont que le eonvoi a passe quand il a quitte New York e matin etait fort long.
E87-1045.txt,37,The bridge that the convoy crossed when it left New York this morning was very long. 284 To allow for portability_comma_ the SABA parser translates its natural language input into an mtermediate semantic network formalism called SF for Sentence Formalism _comma_ presented in details in Binot_comma_ 1984_comma_ 1985 .
E87-1045.txt,38,Before generating the SF output_comma_ SABA builds a simplified semantic graph expressing all the semantic dependencies established between the meaningful terms of the sentence.
E87-1045.txt,39,The graph established for sentence 1 is shown in figure 2 .
E87-1045.txt,40,2 pont w LR que .
E87-1045.txt,41,11 BENEFICIARY VALUE INTENSITY QUAL long fort OBJECT AGENT 0 convol MOMENT I passer AGENT OBJECT I 0 quitter New York MOMENT matin These kinds of dependencies are established by using the dual frames method described in Binot and Ribbens 86 .
E87-1045.txt,42,Dual frames is a general method for establishing binary semantic dependencies between all possible types of meaningfull terms.
E87-1045.txt,43,This method supports also a hierarchy of semantic classes and an inheritance mechanism allowing the designer to specify generic semantic frames at a general level.
E87-1045.txt,44,However_comma_ we are not cone reed here by the specifics of a particular semantic method_comma_ but by the kind of syntactic support necessary to establish such dependencies or_comma_ to put it another way_comma_ by the kind of syntactic support needed to identify accurately the arguments fdling the role slots of various meaningfull tenns .
E87-1045.txt,46,Fragmentation 3.1 General discussion Consider again sentence 1 and suppose that a purely semantic system were to understand it by establishing semantic dependencies between words.
E87-1045.txt,47,There would be no reason for such a system to refrain from attempting to connect was long to convoy _comma_ for example_comma_ And_comma_ if the attempt is made_comma_ no amount of semantic or pragmatic knowledge will be able to prevent the connection_comma_ which is perfectly valid as such.
E87-1045.txt,48,Note also that a simple proximity principle would not work in this case.
E87-1045.txt,49,Thus_comma_ any natural language processing system must take into account_comma_ in some way_comma_ the structure of a sentence_comma_ ttowever_comma_ we don t necessarily need to build an intermediate syntactic structure_comma_ such as a parse tree_comma_ showing the detailed phrase structure of the input.
E87-1045.txt,50,The most crucial structural information needed for an accurate semantic processing concerns boundaries across which semantic processing should not be allowed to relate words.
E87-1045.txt,51,These boundaries can be identified by a fragmentation process which will cut a sentence into useful fragments by looking for specific types of words.
E87-1045.txt,52,Except maybe in Wilks system fragmentation has not received the attention it deserves as a faster alternative to full syntactic parsing.
E87-1045.txt,53,Wilks fragmentation process_comma_ however_comma_ was by his own admission too simple.
E87-1045.txt,54,In his system_comma_ fragmentation was performed only once as a preprocessing step_comma_ and was designed around the size of his notion of template .
E87-1045.txt,55,Both of these characteristics_comma_ we think_comma_ give rise to problems.
E87-1045.txt,56,Performing fragmentation as a single preprocessing step is obviously insufficient for garden path sentences and for all the structural ambiguities that cannot be solved without the help of the semantic module.
E87-1045.txt,57,Although Wilks said something about involving some semantic processing at the fragmentation stage_comma_ notably for handling the ambiguity about that he never presented_comma_ to our knowledge_comma_ a systematic procedure to integrate fragmentation and semantics.
E87-1045.txt,58,On the other hand_comma_ we believe that template sized fragments are more troublesome and less us_comma_full than clause sized fragments.
E87-1045.txt,59,Even in straightforward active declarative sentences_comma_ two distinct mechanisms must be provided to establish semantic dependencies in Wilks system template matching_comma_ which identifies agent actionobject triples_comma_ and paraplates_comma_ which are used to tie these templates together.
E87-1045.txt,60,A prepositional phrase constitutes a separate template.
E87-1045.txt,61,One problem with that approach is that in sentences such as The old man in the comer left _comma_ fragmented by Wilks as shown by the . _comma_ the agent ends up in a different fragment than the action and an additionnal step will be required to relate the two.
E87-1045.txt,62,The same problem seems to arise in passive structures John is loved by Mary .
E87-1045.txt,63,To avoid these kinds of problems_comma_ we decided to use clause sized fragments and to establish semantic dependencies directly at the clause level.
E87-1045.txt,64,A third difference between the two approaches is that_comma_ while Wilks never provided a systematic method to solve part of speech ambiguities_comma_ SABA makes use of a part of speech disambiguation preprocessor_comma_ which will be described in the second part of this paper.
E87-1045.txt,65,This module being applied before fragmentation_comma_ we shall assume in the following discussion of the fragmentation mechanism that each word has a single part of speech.
E87-1045.txt,66,3.2 The fragmentation mechanism.
E87-1045.txt,67,We have implemented in the SABA system a fragmentation mechanism which uses the clause as the fundamental fragmentation unit and which is repetitively applied and interleaved with the semantic processing.
E87-1045.txt,68,We start by presenting the basic algorithm_comma_ then_comma_ in the next sections_comma_ we shall discuss some more difficult problems and show how the .
E87-1030.txt,1,identification in human conversation is performed both by describing the objects in question and by pointing at them. Up till now_comma_ only the linguistic component could be simulated in dialog systems.
E87-1030.txt,2,But recently_comma_ technical innovations have made it possible to point at the objects on a display as well.
E87-1030.txt,3,The paper has two intentions.
E87-1030.txt,4,First_comma_ it investigates natural pointing in more detail and offers some possibilities to classify the great variety of pointing actions.
E87-1030.txt,5,Then_comma_ it tries to clarify the extent to which pointing by technical means especially mouse clicks can be regarded as a simulation of natural pointing or as a functional equivalent.
E87-1030.txt,6,Furthermore_comma_ some steps towards even more accurate simulation are briefly mentioned.
E87-1030.txt,8,1.1 Terminological remarks The term deixis denotes those referential devices whose interpretation requires a consideration of the situation of utterance.
E87-1030.txt,9,Local deixis means the specification of directions_comma_ places and objects relative to the speaker s actual orientation.
E87-1030.txt,10,The closely related topics anaphora and text deixis are not treated in this paper.
E87-1030.txt,11,One component of deictic actions are linguistic expressions_comma_ mainly demonstrative pronouns this _comma_ that and adverbs here _comma_ there _comma_ the other being extralinguistic means_comma_ especially pointing gestures.
E87-1030.txt,12,In this paper_comma_ the latter are represented by the sign  Natural pointing denotes pointing actions occurring during interhuman dialog.
E87-1030.txt,13,This includes the use of easily available aids like pencils or pointers.
E87-1030.txt,14,Simulated pohuing means the use of technical pointing devices during man computer dialog.
E87-1030.txt,15,Following the terminology of Clark_comma_ Schreuder_comma_ and Buttrick 1983 _comma_ the object pointed at is called the demonstratum _comma_ and the descriptive part of the accompanying noun phrase if there is one is called the descriptor .
E87-1030.txt,16,The referent is the object to which the whole pointing act is intended to refer.
E87-1030.txt,17,1.2 Motivation In face to face interaction_comma_ pointing gestures are used frequently and efficiently.
E87-1030.txt,18,Although their referential power is beyond any doubt_comma_ they have_comma_ up till now_comma_ hardly ever been treated in more detail.
E87-1030.txt,19,The disciplines concerned with them are mainly semiotics_comma_ linguistics and psychology.
E87-1030.txt,20,Recently_comma_ the investigation of natural pointing has also become interesting for the area of Artificial Intelligence.
E87-1030.txt,21,In dialog systems developed to date_comma_ objects could be referred to by more or less complex verbal descriptions or unique artificial identifiers only.
E87-1030.txt,22,Technical innovations e.g._comma_ high resolution graphic displays_comma_ touch sensitive screens_comma_ pointing devices such as mice or joysticks have made it possible to simulate pointing gestures to various degrees as well.
E87-1030.txt,23,Multimodal input is both more comfortable from the user s point of view_comma_ and a more natural simulation of interhuman communication.
E87-1030.txt,24,Therefore_comma_ several systems have been developed recently which allow the combination of verbal descriptions and pointing gestures for referent identification see section 5.2 .
E87-1030.txt,25,One example is the dialog system XTRA a natural language access system for expert systems which is currently under development at the University of Saarbriicken.
E87-1030.txt,26,Its current application domain is to assist the user in filling out a tax form which is visible on the screen.
E87-1030.txt,27,In section 5.3_comma_ XTRA s deictic component TACTILUS is shortly presented.
E87-1030.txt,28,The term form deixis shall henceforth denote all those pointing actions which are performed in order to specify regions or entries of a form.
E87-1030.txt,29,An adequate simulation of pointing gestures presupposes a thorough investigation of the regularities which underlie natural pointing.
E87-1030.txt,30,Therefore_comma_ the next three sections investigate natural pointing in more detail.
E87-1030.txt,31,Section 2 shows that pointing actions although functionally similar are not a uniform phenomenon but differ with respect to various aspects.
E87-1030.txt,32,Semiotics_comma_ linguistics and psychology study of nonverbal behavior are concerned with these investigations.
E87-1030.txt,33,The interdependency of describing and pointing is the topic of section 3.
E87-1030.txt,34,This relationship is relevant with regard to tan179 guage processing_comma_ because natural and simulated dialog have a lot of problems in common.
E87-1030.txt,35,More details on the issues discussed in section 2 and 3 are to be found in Schmauks 1986b .
E87-1030.txt,36,Section 4 treats the peculiarities of form deixis_comma_ which is the special type of deixis occuring in the XTRA system.
E87-1030.txt,37,Section 5 tries to clarify the extent to which technical pointing devices already in existence can be regarded as a simulation of natural pointing_comma_ or as a functional equivalent.
E87-1030.txt,38,In section 6_comma_ some steps towards even more accurate simulation are briefly mentioned.
E87-1030.txt,39,Thus_comma_ the last two sections are interesting from a cognitive science point of view as well. 2.
E87-1030.txt,40,Essential features of natural pointing All efforts to simulate natural pointing have to take into account that pointing is not a uniform phenomenon.
E87-1030.txt,41,This section shows that the goal pointing at something is achieved by a great variety of body movements.
E87-1030.txt,42,Up till now_comma_ only a small part of these can be simulated see sections 5 and 6 .
E87-1030.txt,43,2.1 The variety of pointing actions Pointing actions are those body movements which are performed by a speaker to direct the hearer s attention to some part of the shared visual field.
E87-1030.txt,44,In the normal case_comma_ both for their encoding and their reception by the hearer no other means than the human body are involved.
E87-1030.txt,45,Successful reference by pointing requires that the addressee pays attention visually to the person who is pointing.
E87-1030.txt,46,One may suppose_comma_ therefore_comma_ that linguistic material such as demonstrative pronouns or deictic adverbs serve as a request to turn one s face to the speaker.
E87-1030.txt,47,Pointing can be performed by various body movements_comma_ mainly gestures.
E87-1030.txt,48,The most frequent one is the finger point _comma_ by which the index finger is extended in the direction of the object or place indicated.
E87-1030.txt,49,A much more vague gesture is pointing with the thumb over one s shoulder.
E87-1030.txt,50,Other extralinguistic reference devices are head movements and line of sight.
E87-1030.txt,51,All these actions are only interpretable as Look there if the speaker uses a body movement which belongs to the stock of signs s he shares with the hearer.
E87-1030.txt,52,For example_comma_ the African mouth point Kirk_comma_ Burton 1981 will not cause the intended reaction on the part of a European hearer.
E87-1030.txt,53,2.2 Visual and tactile pointing Sometimes it is possible not only to point to an object_comma_ but also to touch an object within reach.
E87-1030.txt,54,In these cases_comma_ pointing becomes much more precise_comma_ because some of the ambiguities of natural pointing are dropped see sections 3.3 and 4.1 .
E87-1030.txt,55,If there is a physical contact between finger or pencil etc. and the indicated object_comma_ the action in question is called tactile pointing as opposed to visual pointing where there is no such contact.
E87-1030.txt,56,So far. only a small subset of naturally occurring pointing gestures can be simulated on a terminal screen_comma_ namely certain kinds of tactile pointing gestures.
E87-1030.txt,57,The emphasis of the remainder of this paper will therefore rely upon this type of deictic gesture and its relation to verbal descriptions.
E87-1030.txt,58,However_comma_ many observations to follow will also hold for pointing gestures in general.
E87-1030.txt,59,Tactile pointing gestures can be classified according to various aspects of their observable appearance.
E87-1030.txt,60,Some distinguishing characteristics are body parts involved in execution of the gesture_comma_ i.e. number and position of fingers_comma_ presence or absence of visual guidance_comma_ use of aids pencil_comma_ pointer .... _comma_ complexity of movement singular_comma_ repeated_comma_ multiple pointing _comma_ and duration and intensity of gesture.
E87-1030.txt,61,An adequate simulation of tactile pointing has to take into account at least some of these features.
E87-1030.txt,62,2.3 The relationship between pointing gesture and demonstratum One open problem is whether there are correlations between the physical features of pointing gestures and the objects thereby indicated.
E87-1030.txt,63,Up till now_comma_ it cannot be taken for granted that different persons point in an identical manner at objects of a specific size_comma_ location_comma_ shape_comma_ depth of embedding etc. Empirical investigations are currently being carried out in the XTRA project to answer these questions.
E87-1030.txt,64,Pointing is called punctual _comma_ if the movement of the arm reaches only one apex and thus indicates one single point in space.
E87-1030.txt,65,This gesture is only adequate if the demonstratum is relatively small and motionless.
E87-1030.txt,66,During non punctual pointing actions_comma_ the apex itself performs a complex motion which corresponds in various ways to the object in question_comma_ e.g. follows its motion_comma_ gives its shape or indicates the part of space the object is supposed to be in.
E87-1030.txt,67,Furthermore_comma_ pointing gestures differ in accuracy.
E87-1030.txt,68,Pointing with a pencil_comma_ pointer etc. can be more precise than pointing with a finger or the whole hand.
E87-1030.txt,70,The interdependency of describing and pointing In face to face interaction_comma_ objects are frequendy referred to by gestures and speech in parallel.
E87-1030.txt,71,Simulation of this multimodal process presupposes the investigation of the specific limitations of each component and the advantages of their combination.
E87-1030.txt,72,This is done in the following section.
E87-1030.txt,73,180 There exist both functional and temporal_comma_ relations between gestures and phrases.
E87-1030.txt,74,Gestures can substitute_comma_ repeat_comma_ contradict_comma_ modify or amplify the vocal output Scherer 1979 .
E87-1030.txt,75,Pointing gestures usually amplify deictic expressions and therefore belong to the kind of gestures called illustrators Ekman_comma_ Friesen 1969 .
E87-1030.txt,76,Norreally_comma_ pointing gestures and their correlated phrases are produced simultaneously Levelt_comma_ Richardson_comma_ and La Heij 1985 .
E87-1030.txt,77,3.1 Obligatory and optional pointing gestures Some deictic expressions must be accompanied by a pointing action or a linguistic equivalent_comma_ Sennholz 1985 .
E87-1030.txt,78,These include demonstrative pronouns this book _comma_ heterodeictic lncal adverbs the tree there _comma_ personal pronouns with deictic function he did it _comma_ and such constructions I hke such flowers .
E87-1030.txt,79,Syntactically_comma_ obligatory pointing gestures are embedded in noun phrases or adverbial phrases.
E87-1030.txt,80,In the former case_comma_ they amplify a linguistic attribute.
E87-1030.txt,81,Within its corresponding phrase_comma_ the location of the pointing gesture is arbitrary.
E87-1030.txt,82,Usually_comma_ it will accompany the most emphasized expression.
E87-1030.txt,83,A lot of expressions can be accompanied by pointing gestures_comma_ in principle all those which refer to visible objects_comma_ events etc. OptionM pointing gestures have various functions_comma_ e.g. to mark whether the speaker uses adverbs deictically or relative to another orientation system.
E87-1030.txt,84,3.2 Pointing simplifies describing The use of purely verbal descriptions can fail for various .reasons.
E87-1030.txt,85,For example_comma_ some descriptions may not completely specify their referents They can be wrong_comma_ inconsistent or too subjective.
E87-1030.txt,86,But even adequate descriptions can cause misinterpretations.
E87-1030.txt,87,One extreme would include descriptions with little intension and therefore too wide an extension_comma_ such whatsit or thingamajig generally used if one doesn t know a more precise descriptor .
E87-1030.txt,88,The other extreme includes very detailed and complex descriptions which are difficult to process e.g._comma_ the small red book on the left side in the second shelf from the top .
E87-1030.txt,89,A closely related problem is that of technical terms used in conversation with non specialists Although the description may be totally adequate_comma_ the hearer is not able to understand it.
E87-1030.txt,90,Therefore_comma_ verbal description alone may be too general or too specific.
E87-1030.txt,91,Within this range_comma_ the speaker has the task of specifying the referent in enough detail without constructing a verbal expression which is too complex.
E87-1030.txt,92,One frequent solution is the use of pointing gestures.
E87-1030.txt,93,They allow successful reference without the need of totally specified verbal descriptions Pechmann_comma_ Deutsch 1982 .
E87-1030.txt,94,The use of pointing shortens the accompanying descriptor and the loss of intension is compensated by the gesture.
E87-1030.txt,95,General nouns amplified by pointing gestures can substitute for more specific nouns e.g._comma_ I like cornflowers is replacable by I like these flowers .
E87-1030.txt,96,Thus_comma_ additional pointing allows unambiguous or at least relatively precise referent specification even if one doesn t know an exact descriptor.
E87-1030.txt,97,The process of referent identification is speeded up_comma_ because the orientation to the object s direction and the processing of the verbal description are performed simultaneously.
E87-1030.txt,98,3.3 Describing disambiguates pointing One essential drawback of pointing gestures is their inevitable dependency on the here and now.
E87-1030.txt,99,Furthermore_comma_ pointing without describing the referent is fundamentaUy ambiguous Wittgenstein 1958 .
E87-1030.txt,100,Referent identification involves the following three steps First_comma_ one has to recognize the direction indicated.
E87-1030.txt,101,This requires facing the speaker and following his her gesture with gaze and eventually a body turn.
E87-1030.txt,102,Thus_comma_ the deictic spaces of both participants are co oriented by physical means and not by mental acts e.g._comma_ transformation of left into right and vice versa_comma_ see Klein 1978 .
E87-1030.txt,103,The second task is the identification of the object indicated.
E87-1030.txt,104,Usually_comma_ there is more than one object situated in any one direction.
E87-1030.txt,105,Problems arise if possible demonstrata are next to each other_comma_ behind each other_comma_ or embedded in one another.
E87-1030.txt,106,In these cases_comma_ unambiguous reference requires the naming or describing of the demonstratum.
E87-1030.txt,107,Thirdly_comma_ one has to decide what aspect of the object is being referred to.
E87-1030.txt,108,Like the second step_comma_ this is usually done by consideration of the descriptor.
E87-1030.txt,109,For example_comma_ pointing at a moving car can refer to its colour Nice green 7 _comma_ isn t it or its kind of motion This speed .1 causes lots of accidents etc. Pointing at sets of objects can even refer to aspects of higher degree such as number I d like to have that man _comma_ _comma_I books .
E87-1030.txt,111,Form deixis Pointing at two dimensional objects forms_comma_ diagrams_comma_ maps_comma_ pictures etc. differs in various aspects from pointing at objects within the entire visual field.
E87-1030.txt,112,This offers a definite advantage from a linguistic point of view Some problems of local deixis are reduced in complexity without the communicative setting having to become unnatural Schmauks 1986a .
E87-1030.txt,113,Furthermore_comma_ 181 this domain is interesting from an artificial intelligence point of view_comma_ since some of the pointing actions with regard to forms can now be simulated on a terminal screen.
E87-1030.txt,114,4.1 Reduction of problems Following Bfihler s terminology 1982 _comma_ form deixis belongs to the kind of deixis called demonstratio ad oculos _comma_ because all objects pointed at are visible.
E87-1030.txt,115,Furthermore_comma_ it represents an example of the canonical situation of utterance Lyons 1977 All the participants are co present and can thus mutually perceive their pointing gestures etc. Form deixis is relatively precise_comma_ because tactile pointing is always possible.
E87-1030.txt,116,Precise pointing at small objects e.g. single words is frequently performed by using a pencil etc._comma_ larger areas by encircling them.
E87-1030.txt,117,The ambiguity with regard to objects behind each other does not occur_comma_ because the deictic space is only two dimensional.
E87-1030.txt,118,If speaker and hearer are situated side by side_comma_ their deictic fields are co oriented.
E87-1030.txt,119,Therefore_comma_ this position makes cooperation easier_comma_ and thus is the most advantageous one.
E87-1030.txt,120,4.2 Remaining problems Although form deixis implies a reduction of problems_comma_ referent identification has not at all become a trivial task.
E87-1030.txt,121,It cannot be taken for granted that demonstratum and referent are identical.
E87-1030.txt,122,This might be due to the fact that the speaker has mistakenly pointed at a wrong place because s he doesn t know the referent s actual location or misses the target by accident.
E87-1030.txt,123,Other divergencies emerge intentionally The speaker doesn t want to cover the referent and therefore points a bit lower.
E87-1030.txt,124,Other essential problems arise because there exist subset relations among form regions.
E87-1030.txt,125,For example_comma_ the demonstratum can be a part of the referent this is referred to as pars pro toto deixis .
E87-1030.txt,126,In those cases_comma_ one must take into account the verbal description to resolve the ambiguity.
E87-1030.txt,127,Furthermore_comma_ pointing at one form region can depending on linguistic context refer to three different entities 1.
E87-1030.txt,128,The form region itself What is to be entered here
E87-1030.txt,130,The actual entry I want to increase this sun . 3.
E87-1030.txt,131,Correlated concepts Are these expenses to be verified 5.
E87-1030.txt,132,Simulated pointing This section investigates the extent to which some features of natural pointing can already be simulated in dialog systems developed to date.
E87-1030.txt,133,In section 6_comma_ some steps towards more accurate simulation are briefly suggested.
E87-1030.txt,134,5.1 Different ways of simulating pointing gestures Face to face interaction is performed by gestures and speech in parallel.
E87-1030.txt,135,In many domains e.g. form deixis _comma_ objects are often and efficiently referred to by pointing gestures.
E87-1030.txt,136,Thus_comma_ dialog systems will become more natural if the user has the possibility of pointing at the objects which are visible on the screen.
E87-1030.txt,137,The goal reference by pointing can be achieved by various strategies.
E87-1030.txt,138,One fundamental decision must be made first whether one wants to simulate natural pointing as is the aim of TACTILUS or to offer functionM equivalents.
E87-1030.txt,139,In the former case_comma_ there is the presupposed but questionable demand that man machinecommunication should be performed by the same means as interhuman communication.
E87-1030.txt,140,If the main emphasis relies on simulation_comma_ then the pointing device and its use must correspond to natural pointing as accurately as possible.
E87-1030.txt,141,In this case_comma_ the most adequate simulation will be pointing at a touch sensitive screen see section 6 .
E87-1030.txt,142,But other devices e.g. input via mouse clicks can also partially simulate natural pointing see sections 5.3 .
E87-1030.txt,143,Functional equivalents to natural pointing include the following devices Framing the referent or zooming in on it_comma_ highlighting it in different colours etc. see Ffthnrich et al. 1984 .
E87-1030.txt,144,On the one hand_comma_ the system can point by these means.
E87-1030.txt,145,On the other hand_comma_ the user gets immediate teedback as to whether the system has recognized the intended referent.
E87-1030.txt,146,This advantage is paid for by the loss of naturalness .
E87-1030.txt,147,5.2 Historical remarks Multimodal input_comma_ especially the possibility of pointing at visible objects_comma_ offers certain crucial advantages.
E87-1030.txt,148,For example_comma_ the use of simple pointing actions was already possible in the following systems SCHOLAR Carbonell 1970 allows pointing gestures in order to specify regions of geographic maps.
E87-1030.txt,149,Pointing in Woods 1979 system_comma_ combined with simple descriptions_comma_ refers to substructures of a parse tree displayed on the screen.
E87-1030.txt,150,In NLG Brown et al. 1979 _comma_ the user can draw simple geometric objects through descriptive NL commands and simultaneous tactile touches on the screen.
E87-1030.txt,151,SDMS Bolt 1980 enables the user to create and manipulate geometric objects on a screenarrangement called MEDIA ROOM .
E87-1030.txt,152,In all those systems_comma_ there exist predefined relations between the pointing gesture and its demonstratum.
E87-1030.txt,153,Referent identification is not dependent on context etc. Currently_comma_ several projects are investigating problems concerning the integration of pointing actions and NL input_comma_ e.g. In NLMENU Thompson 1986 _comma_ the user can select parts of a street map by means 182 of a mouse controlled rubber band technique.
E87-1030.txt,154,Hayes 1986 oudines the integration of a deictic component into the Language Craft System_comma_ which should allow the user to click on items on the screen_comma_ e.g. the machines on a blueprint of a factory floor.
E87-1030.txt,155,ACORD investigates pointing actions with respect to various twodimensional objects_comma_ e.g. a map of the planetary system Hanne_comma_ Hoepelmann_comma_ and F ihnrich 1986 and a form for university registration Wetzel_comma_ Hanne_comma_ and Hoepelmann 1987 .
E87-1030.txt,156,5.3 Pointing actions in TAGTILUS One aim of XTRA is the integration of typed verbal descriptions and pointing gestures currently realized by mouse clicks for referent identification Kobsa et al. 1986 .
E87-1030.txt,157,The user should be able to efficiently refer to objects on the screen_comma_ even when s he uses underspecified descriptions and or imprecise pointing gestures Allgayer_comma_ Reddig 1986 .
E87-1030.txt,158,Hence the process of specifying referents is speeded up and requires less knowledge of specialist terms.
E87-1030.txt,159,The deictic component of XTRA called TACTILUS is completely implemented on a Symbolics Lisp Machine Allgayer 1086 .
E87-1030.txt,160,It offers four types of pointing gestures which differ in accuracy.
E87-1030.txt,161,They correspond to three modes of punctual pointing with pencil_comma_ index finger_comma_ or hand and to the possibility of encircling the demonstratum.
E87-1030.txt,162,Thus_comma_ pointing becomes a two step process First_comma_ one has to select the intended degree of preciseness and then to point .
E87-1030.txt,163,These pointing actions are natural because of their ambiguity There is no predefined relation between the spot where the mouse is activated and the object which is thereby referred to.
E87-1030.txt,164,Therefore_comma_ the system has to take into account additional knowledge sources for referent identification_comma_ e.g. verbal descriptions and dialog memory.
E87-1030.txt,165,From the user s point of view_comma_ the essential indication of this naturalness is the lack of visual feedback.
E87-1030.txt,166,In analogy to natural pointing_comma_ the identified referent is not highlighted.
E87-1030.txt,167,5.4 Problems in processing mixed input One essential problem is to assign a mouse click to its corresponding verbal constituent.
E87-1030.txt,168,This task is not trivial since there is no guarantee that the user points within the range of the deictic expression.
E87-1030.txt,169,Possibly_comma_ the click occurs too late because of the user being inattentive_comma_ not familiar with the system etc. One example is What is this sum above the last entry
E87-1030.txt,170,Here_comma_ the pointing action occurs next to the last entry .
E87-1030.txt,171,But this is an anaphor and doesn t need to be amplified.
E87-1030.txt,172,On the other hand_comma_ there is the deictic expression this sum without its correlated obligatory pointing action.
E87-1030.txt,173,Therefore_comma_ the system has to recognize that  belongs to this sum .
E87-1030.txt,174,This problem is aggravated by the fact that the words here there and this that are not only the most frequent deictic expressions but have anaphoric and text deictic readings as well.
E87-1030.txt,175,Matching mouse clicks and phrases becomes even more difficult if a single utterance requires more than one pointing action.
E87-1030.txt,176,This case is called multiple pointing .
E87-1030.txt,177,Examples include This sum I would prefer to enter here.
E87-1030.txt,178,Hayes 1986 assumes that pointing actions are performed in the same order as their corresponding phrases.
E87-1030.txt,179,But until this hypothesis is confirmed empirically_comma_ it can only serve as a heuristic rule.
E87-1030.txt,180,As soon as reference by pointing is possible_comma_ the use of incomplete expressions will increase.
E87-1030.txt,181,In these cases_comma_ additional knowledge sources are needed for referent identification_comma_ like descriptor analysis and case frame analysis Kobsa et al. 1986 .
E87-1030.txt,182,For example_comma_ the expression this in the sentence I want to add Sis  surely refers to a number in the present domain_comma_ because add is categorized as an action to be performed with numbers.
E87-1030.txt,183,5.5 Problems in generating mixed output If the pointing actions of the system are also conceived as a simulation of natural pointing_comma_ the user is confronted with the same problems that have already been identified in the last subsection Reithinger 1987 .
E87-1030.txt,184,But_comma_ whereas multiple pointing can be simulated during input_comma_ there seems to be no adequate mode for simulating it during output as well In normal communication_comma_ the hearer doesn t need to watch the speaker in order to understand him her unless the occurence ofa deictic expression or the sound of touching during tactile pointing demands his her visual attentiveness.
E87-1030.txt,185,Also_comma_ during typed dialog_comma_ there is no need to observe the output sentences permanently.
E87-1030.txt,186,In the case of multiple pointing_comma_ the possibility cannot be ruled out that the user might fail to notice one of the pointing actions.
E87-1030.txt,188,Prospects of more natural simulation Up till now_comma_ only certain kinds of tactile pointing gestures can be simulated on a screen.
E87-1030.txt,189,Negroponte 1981 oudines some future plans_comma_ e.g. the consideration of non tactile actions such as eye tracking and body movements.
E87-1030.txt,190,Simulation of tactile pointing gestures by mouseclicks has some serious limitations with regard to its naturalness .
E87-1030.txt,191,Empirical investigations are needed to determine the extent to which mouse clicks can be regarded as an equivalent of natural pointing.
E87-1030.txt,192,These investigations are currently carried out in the XTRA project.
E87-1030.txt,193,183 In the case of natural pointing_comma_ the choice of a more or less precise pointing gesture is made automatically rather than consciously.
E87-1030.txt,194,But in TACTILUS_comma_ the user has tc_comma_ select explicitly the intended degree of accuracy.
E87-1030.txt,195,Empirical investigations must examine whether the user regards this as a disadvantage.
E87-1030.txt,196,Furthermore_comma_ pointing via mouse clicks differs from natural tactile pointing_comma_ because there is no physical contact between finger and demonstratum.
E87-1030.txt,197,A better solution would be the use of a touch sensitive screen on which real world gestures see Minsky 1984 are possible.
E87-1030.txt,198,Touch sensitive screens allow highly natural pointing gestures see Picketing 1986 _comma_ but have some shortcomings_comma_ e.g. a restricted degree of resolution.
E87-1030.txt,199,A problem just as serious as the aforementioned is the temporal dissociation of a pointing gesture and its corresponding phrase.
E87-1030.txt,200,This problem would be soluble if the system would accept input via voice.
E87-1030.txt,201,But this alone wouldn t be sufficient There is no guarantee that spoken phrases and correlated mouse clicks occur simultaneously.
E87-1030.txt,202,Furthermore_comma_ current voice input systems have too small a vocabulary and cannot process fluent speech.
E87-1030.txt,203,Therefore_comma_ the most adequate simulation would be the combination of voice input output and gestures on a touch sensitive screen.
E87-1030.txt,204,However_comma_ the state of the art with respect to the required devices is not yet sufficient.

E87-1030.txt,206,I am indepted to my colleagues of the XTRA project for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper. .
E87-1004.txt,1,recent years the nature and the role of a morphological component in NLP systems has attracted a lot of attention. The two level model of Koskenniemi which relates graphemlc to morphological structure has been succesfully implemented in the form of finite state automata.
E87-1004.txt,2,Xn EUROTRA a solution which combines morphological and surface syntactic processing in one CFG implemented in a unification grammar framework has been tried out.
E87-1004.txt,3,This article contrasts these two approaches considering especially the feasibility of building morphologlcal modules for a big multilingual MT system in a decentralised R V project.
E87-1004.txt,5,The development of sophisticated NLP applications has created a need for specific processing in order to be able to cope with large vocabularies without creating monstruous dictionaries.
E87-1004.txt,6,Earlier approaches often avoided morphology more or less by listing full wordforms in the dictionary or by simply segmenting some inflectional endings with a few general rules.
E87-1004.txt,7,Much recent work is based on the Two level Model Koskenniemi_comma_ 1983 and relates directly or indirectly to the original implementation of this model in the form of finite state transducers FST .
E87-1004.txt,8,The original notation and implementation have been further developed and refined cf. e.g. Black_comma_ 1986 and Bear_comma_ 1986 in order to improve compilation and runtime_comma_ debugging and rule writing facilities.
E87-1004.txt,9,Still some problems persist and others have not been touched yet.
E87-1004.txt,10,This paper presents an alternative_comma_ but not contradictory_comma_ solution which has to some extent been tried out in the EUROTRA Machine Translation Project and argues that the two level approach may not be entirely viable in a decentralised R D project which aims at he creation of a big multilingual HT system.
E87-1004.txt,12,THE TWO LEVEL MODEL The original presentation of the model Koskenniemi_comma_ 1983 shows that it is possible to treat the inflectional morphology including spelling rules of a highly inflected language like Finnish by establishing correspondences between a surface alphabet and a lexical alphabet the two levels and using a lexicon to determine which combinations of characters and morphemes are legal.
E87-1004.txt,13,Moreover_comma_ this is done by means of declarative rules_comma_ thereby avoiding the procedural problems of generative phonology_comma_ and the algorithm used is language independent.
E87-1004.txt,14,Together with the fact that the model may bc used for synthesis as well as for analysis this is a strong argument in favour of employing a two level approach to morphology.
E87-1004.txt,15,Later work points to some important shortcomings of the original implementation of the model in the loom of FST s Black_comma_ 1986 .
E87-1004.txt,16,Especially compilation and runtime requirements and debugging are seen to pose severe problems.
E87-1004.txt,17,In Black s words Debugging automata is reminiscent of debugging assembly language progranuuing in hex .
E87-1004.txt,18,Considering that the linguistic user is interested in the rules rather than in the low level implementation of them_comma_ Black et al. have proceeded to develop high level notations in the form of rules which are interpreted directly_comma_ instead of being compiled into FST s.
E87-1004.txt,19,Nonetheless_comma_ they entirely respect the two level approach in their notation.
E87-1004.txt,20,Their rules still establish correspondences between_comma_ on one side_comma_ elements of a lexical alphabet the characters of the natural language alphabet plus the empty character if _comma_ the morpheme boundary _comma_ and archiphonemes noted as capital letters and_comma_ on the other side_comma_ the elements of a surface alphabet the characters of the natural language plus the empty character _comma_ and they use a lexicon to determine which combinations of characters make up legal morphemes.
E87-1004.txt,21,Their work shows the relative independence of the rule formalism from its implementation accepting the two level model by no means forces one to accept FST s as an implementation vehicle and it shows that the rules for combination of characters spelling rules or morpho graphemics are best treated in isolation from the rules for combination of morphemes morpho syntax .
E87-1004.txt,22,This latter approach has been further developed by Bear Bear_comma_ 1986 .
E87-1004.txt,23,He combines a two level approach to morpho graphemics with a unification grammar approach a modified PATE rule interpreter to morpho syntax.
E87-1004.txt,24,The resulting 19 implementation preserves the generality and flexibility of the treatment of morpho graphemic phenomena like allomorphy while_comma_ at the same time_comma_ avoiding the problems of treating morpho syntax in the lexicon_comma_ which in reality is what happens in Koskenniemi s original model where the lexical entries for root morphemes are marked for continuation classes .
E87-1037.txt,1,several grammatical formalisms converge towards being declarative and towards utilizing context free phrase structure grammar as a backbone_comma_ e.g. LFG and PATR II.
E87-1037.txt,2,Typically the processing of these formalisms is organized within a chart parsing framework.
E87-1037.txt,3,The declarative character of the formalisms makes it important to decide upon an overall optimal control strategy on the part of the processor.
E87-1037.txt,4,In particular_comma_ this brings the ruleinvocation strategy into critical focus to gain maximal processing efficiency_comma_ one has to determine the best way of putting the rules to use.
E87-1037.txt,5,The aim of this paper is to provide a survey and a practical comparison of fundamental rule invocation strategies within context free chart parsing.
E87-1037.txt,6,1 Background and .
E87-1037.txt,7,An apparent tendency in computational linguistics during the last few years has been towards declarative grammar formalisms.
E87-1037.txt,8,This tendency has manifested itself with respect to linguistic tools_comma_ perhaps seen most clearly in the evolution from ATNs with their strongly procedural grammars to PATR II in its various incarnations Shieber et al. 1983_comma_ Karttunen 1986 _comma_ and to logic based formalisms such as DCG Pereira and Warren 1980 .
E87-1037.txt,9,It has also manifested itself in linguistic theor es_comma_ where there has been a development from systems employing sequential derivations in the analysis of sentence structures to systems like LFG and GPSG which establish relations among the elements of a sentence in an order independent and also direction independent way.
E87-1037.txt,10,For example_comma_ phenomena such as rule ordering simply do not arise in these theories.
E87-1037.txt,11,This research has been supported by the National Swedish Board for Technical Development.
E87-1037.txt,12,In addition_comma_ declarative formalisms are_comma_ in principle_comma_ processor independent.
E87-1037.txt,13,Procedural formalisms_comma_ although possibly highly standardized like Woods ATN formalism _comma_ typically make .
E87-1040.txt,2,The knowledge base data structure is such as to provide easy access by the semantic verification algorithm.
E87-1040.txt,3,This paper discusses some important problem related to the definition of a semantic knowledge base_comma_ as depth versus generality_comma_ hierarchical ordering of concept types_comma_ etc._comma_ and describes the solutions adopted within the text understanding project. .
E87-1040.txt,4,The main problem encountered in natural language NL understanding systems is that of the trade off between depth and extension of the semantic knowledge base.
E87-1040.txt,5,Processing time and robustness dramatically get worse when the system is required to deeply understand texts in unrestricted domains.
E87-1040.txt,7,The idea is to capture only the basic information_comma_ much in the same way of a hurried newspaper reader.
E87-1040.txt,9,The knowledge domain is based on the description of physical objects MPs Memory Pointers _comma_ and their mutual relations RWs Relation Words .
E87-1040.txt,11,BORIS was designed to understand as deeply as possible a limited number of stories.
E87-1040.txt,12,A first prototype of BORIS can successfully answer a variety of questions on divorce stories an extension to different domains appears however extremely complex without structural changes.
E87-1040.txt,13,The current status of the art on knowledge representation and language processing does not offer readily available solutions at this regard.
E87-1040.txt,14,The system presented in this paper does not propose a panacea for semantic knowledge representation_comma_ but shows the viability of a deep semaatic approach even in unrestricted domains.
E87-1040.txt,15,The features of the Italian Text Understanding system are summarized as follows Text analysis is performed in four steps morphologic_comma_ morphosyntactic_comma_ syntactic and semantic analysis.
E87-1040.txt,16,At each step the results of the preceding steps are used to restrict Ihe current scope of analysis.
E87-1040.txt,17,Hence for example Ihe semantic analyzer uses the syntactic relations identified by the parser to produce an initial set of possiNe interpretations of the sentence.
E87-1040.txt,18,Semantic knowledge is represented in a very detailed form word_sense pragmatics .
E87-1040.txt,19,Logic is used to implement in a uniform and simple framework the data structure representing semantic knowledge and the programs performing semantic verification.
E87-1040.txt,21,The system is based on VM PROLOG and analyzes press_agency releases in the economic domain.
E87-1040.txt,22,Even though the specific application oriented the choice of words to be entered in the semantic data base_comma_ no other restrictions where added.
E87-1040.txt,23,Press agency releases do not present any specific morphologic or syntactic simplification in the sentence structure.
E87-1040.txt,24,This paper deals with definition of knowledge structures for semantic analysis.
E87-1040.txt,25,Basically_comma_ the semantic processor collsi_comma_qs of 1. a dictionary of word definitions.

E99-1021.txt,1,this paper we present an approach to automatic authorship attribution dealing with real world or unrestricted text. Our method is based on the computational analysis of the input text using a text processing tool.
E99-1021.txt,2,Besides the style markers relevant to the output of this tool we also use analysis dependent style markers_comma_ that is_comma_ measures that represent the way in which the text has been processed.
E99-1021.txt,3,No word frequency counts_comma_ nor other lexically based measures are taken into account.
E99-1021.txt,4,We show that the proposed set of style markers is able to distinguish texts of various authors of a weekly newspaper using multiple regression.
E99-1021.txt,5,All the experiments we present were performed using real world text downloaded from the World Wide Web.
E99-1021.txt,6,Our approach is easily trainable and fully automated requiring no manual text preprocessing nor sampling.
E99-1021.txt,8,The vast majority of the attempts to computerassisted authorship attribution has been focused on literary texts.
E99-1021.txt,9,In particular_comma_ a lot of attention has been paid to the establishment of the authorship of anonymous or doubtful texts.
E99-1021.txt,10,A typical paradigm is the case of the Federalist papers twelve of which are of disputed authorship Mosteller and Wallace_comma_ 1984 Holmes and Forsyth_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1021.txt,11,Moreover_comma_ the lack of a generic and formal definition of the idiosyncratic style of an author has led to the employment of statistical methods e.g._comma_ discriminant analysis_comma_ principal components_comma_ etc. .
E99-1021.txt,12,Nowadays_comma_ the wealth of text available in the World Wide Web in electronic form for a wide variety of genres and languages_comma_ as well as the development of reliable text processing tools open the way for the solution of the authorship attribution problem as regards real world text.
E99-1021.txt,13,The most important approaches to authorship attribution involve lexically based measures.
E99-1021.txt,14,A lot of style markers have been proposed for measuring the richness of the vocabulary used by the author.
E99-1021.txt,15,For example_comma_ the type token ratio_comma_ the hapax legomena i.e._comma_ once occurring words _comma_ the hapax dislegomena i.e._comma_ twiceoccurring words _comma_ etc. There are also functions that make use of these measures such as Yule s K Yule_comma_ 1944 _comma_ Honore s R Honore_comma_ 1979 _comma_ etc. A review of this metrics can be found in Holmes_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1021.txt,16,In Holmes and Forsyth_comma_ 1994 five vocabulary richness functions were used in the framework of a multivariate statistical analysis of the Federalist papers and a principal components analysis was performed.
E99-1021.txt,17,All the disputed papers lie in the side of James Madison rather than Alexander Hamilton in the space of the first two principal components.
E99-1021.txt,18,However_comma_ such measures require the development of large lexicons with specialized information in order to detect the various forms of the lexical units that constitute an author s vocabulary.
E99-1021.txt,19,For languages with a rich morphology_comma_ i.e.
E99-1021.txt,20,Modem Greek_comma_ this is an important shortcoming.
E99-1021.txt,21,Instead of counting how many words occur certain number of times_comma_ Burrows 1987 proposed the use of a set of common function or context free word frequencies in the sample text.
E99-1021.txt,22,This method combined with a principal components analysis achieved remarkable results when applied to a wide variety of authors Burrows_comma_ 1992 .
E99-1021.txt,23,On the other hand_comma_ a lot of 158 Proceedings of EACL 99 effort is required regarding the selection of the most appropriate set of words that best distinguish a given set of authors Holmes and Forsyth_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1021.txt,24,Moreover_comma_ all the lexicallybased style markers are highly author and language dependent.
E99-1021.txt,25,The results of a work using such measures_comma_ therefore_comma_ can not be applied to a different group of authors nor another language.
E99-1021.txt,26,In order to avoid the problems of lexicallybased measures_comma_ Baayen_comma_ et al._comma_ 1996 proposed the use of syntax based ones.
E99-1021.txt,27,This approach is based on the frequencies of the rewrite rules as they appear in a syntactically annotated corpus.
E99-1021.txt,28,Both high frequent and low frequent rewrite rules give accuracy results comparable to lexically based methods.
E99-1021.txt,29,However_comma_ the computational analysis is considered as a significant limitation of this method since the required syntactic annotation scheme is very complicated and current text processing tools are not capable of providing automatically such information_comma_ especially in the case of unrestricted text.
E99-1021.txt,30,To the best of our knowledge_comma_ there is no computational system for the automatic detection of authorship dealing with real world text.
E99-1021.txt,31,In thispaper_comma_ we present an approach to this problem.
E99-1021.txt,32,In particular_comma_ our aim is the discrimination between the texts of various authors of a Modem Greek weekly newspaper.
E99-1021.txt,33,We use an already existing text processing tool able to detect sentence and chunk boundaries in unrestricted text for the extraction of style markers.
E99-1021.txt,34,Instead of trying to minimize the computational analysis of the text_comma_ we attempt to take advantage of this procedure.
E99-1021.txt,35,In particular_comma_ we use a set of analysis level style markers_comma_ i.e._comma_ measures that represent the way in which the text has been processed by the tool.
E99-1021.txt,36,For example_comma_ a useful measure is the percentage of the sample text remaining unanalyzed after the automatic processing.
E99-1021.txt,37,In other words_comma_ we attempt to adapt the set of the style markers to the method used by the sentence and chunk detector in order to analyze the sample text.
E99-1021.txt,38,The statistical technique of multiple regression is_comma_ then_comma_ used for extracting a linear combination of the values of the style markers that manages to distinguish the different authors.
E99-1021.txt,39,The experiments we present_comma_ for both author identification and author verification tasks_comma_ were performed using real world text downloaded from the World Wide Web.
E99-1021.txt,40,Our approach is easily trainable and fully automated requiring no manual text preprocessing nor sampling.
E99-1021.txt,41,A brief description of the extraction of the style markers is given in section 2.
E99-1021.txt,42,Section 3 describes the composition of the corpus of realworld text used in the experiments.
E99-1021.txt,43,The training procedure is given in section 4 while section 5 comprises analytical experimental results.
E99-1021.txt,44,Finally_comma_ in section 6 some conclusions are drawn and future work directions are given.
E99-1021.txt,45,2 Extraction of Style Markers As aforementioned_comma_ an already existing tool is used for the extraction of the style markers.
E99-1021.txt,46,This tool is a Sentence and Chunk Boundaries Detector SCBD able to deal with unrestricted Modem Greek text Stamatatos_comma_ et aL_comma_ forthcoming .
E99-1021.txt,47,Initially_comma_ SCBD segments the input text into sentences using a set of disambiguation rules_comma_ and then detects the boundaries of intrasentential phrases i.e._comma_ chunks such as noun phrases_comma_ prepositional phrases_comma_ etc. It has to be noted that SCBD makes use of no complicated resources e.g._comma_ large lexicons .
E99-1021.txt,48,Rather_comma_ it is based on common word suffixes and a set of keywords in order to detect the chunk boundaries using empirically derived rules.
E99-1021.txt,50,Based on the output of this tool_comma_ the following measures are provided Token leveh sentence count_comma_ word count_comma_ punctuation mark count_comma_ etc. Phrase level noun phrase count_comma_ word included in noun phrases count prepositional phrase count_comma_ word included in prepositional phrases count etc. In addition_comma_ we use measures relevant to the computational analysis of the input text 159 Proceedings of EACL 99 Table 1.

E99-1021.txt,63,The latter measures can be calculated only when this particular computational tool is utilized.
E99-1021.txt,64,In more detail_comma_ SCBD performs multiple pass parsing i.e._comma_ 5 passes .
E99-1021.txt,65,Each parsing pass analyzes a part of the sentence_comma_ based on the results of the previous passes_comma_ and the remaining part is kept for the subsequent passes.
E99-1021.txt,66,The first passes try to detect the simplest cases of the chunk boundaries which are easily recognizable while the last ones deal with more complicated cases using the findings of the previous passes.
E99-1021.txt,67,The percentage of the words remaining unanalyzed after each parsing pass_comma_ therefore_comma_ is an important stylistic factor that represents the syntactic complexity of the text.
E99-1021.txt,68,Additionally_comma_ the measure of the detected keywords and the detected words that do not match any of the stored suffixes include crucial stylistic information.
E99-1021.txt,69,The vast majority of the natural language processing tools can provide analysis level style markers.
E99-1021.txt,70,However_comma_ the manner of capturing the stylistic information may differ since it depends on the method of analysis.
E99-1021.txt,71,In order to normalize the calculated style markers we make use of ratios of them e.g._comma_ words sentences_comma_ noun phrases total detected chunks_comma_ words remaining unanalyzed after parsing pass 1 words_comma_ etc. .
E99-1021.txt,72,The total set of style markers comprises 22 markers_comma_ namely 3 token level_comma_ 10 phrase level_comma_ and 9 analysis level ones.
E99-1021.txt,73,3 Corpus The corpus used for this study consists of texts downloaded from the World Wide Web site of the Modem Greek weekly newspaper TO BHMA Dolnet_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1021.txt,74,This newspaper comprises several supplements.
E99-1021.txt,75,We chose to deal with authors of the supplement B_comma_ entitled NEEZ EHOXEZ i.e._comma_ new ages _comma_ which comprises essays on science_comma_ culture_comma_ history_comma_ etc. since in such writings the indiosyncratic style of the author is not likely to be overshadowed by the characteristics of the corresponding text genre.
E99-1021.txt,76,In general_comma_ the texts included in the supplement B are written by scholars_comma_ writers_comma_ etc._comma_ rather than journalists.
E99-1021.txt,77,Moreover_comma_ there is a closed set of authors that regularly publish their writings in the pages of this supplement.
E99-1021.txt,78,The collection of a considerable amount of texts by an author was_comma_ therefore_comma_ possible.
E99-1021.txt,79,Initially_comma_ we selected l0 authors whose writings are frequently published in this supplement.
E99-1021.txt,80,No special criteria have been taken into account.
E99-1021.txt,81,Then_comma_ 20 texts of each author were downloaded from the Web site of the newspaper.
E99-1021.txt,82,No manual text preprocessing nor text sampling was performed aside from removing unnecessary headings.
E99-1021.txt,83,All the downloaded texts were taken from issues published during 1998 in order to minimize the potential change of the personal style of an author over time.
E99-1021.txt,84,Some statistics of the downloaded corpus are shown in table 1.
E99-1021.txt,85,The last column of this table refers to the thematic area of the majority of the writings of each author.
E99-1021.txt,86,Notice that this information was not 160 Proceedings of EACL 99 taken into account during the construction of the corpus.
E99-1021.txt,87,4 Training The corpus described in the previous section was divided into a training and a test corpus.
E99-1021.txt,88,As it is shown by Biber 1990 1993 _comma_ it is possible to represent the distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category based on relatively few texts from each category i.e._comma_ as few as ten texts .
E99-1021.txt,89,Thus_comma_ for each author 10 texts were used for training and I 0 for testing.
E99-1021.txt,90,All the texts were analyzed using SCBD which provided a vector of 22 style markers for each text.
E99-1021.txt,91,Then_comma_ the statistical methodology of multivariate linear multiple regression was applied to the training corpus.
E99-1021.txt,92,Multiple regression provides predicting values of a group of response dependent variables from a collection of predictor independent variable values.
E99-1021.txt,93,The response is expressed as a linear combination of the predictor variables_comma_ namely y bo zlblt z2b2i ... zrbri e where y_comma_ is the response for the i th author_comma_ zi_comma_ ze_comma_..and Zr are the predictor variables i.e._comma_ in our case r 22 _comma_ bo_comma_ bl_comma__comma_ b2_comma__comma_..._comma_ and br_comma__comma_ are the unknown coefficients_comma_ and e_comma_ is the random error.
E99-1021.txt,94,During the training procedure the unknown coefficients for each author are determined using binary values for the response variable i.e._comma_ I for the texts written by the author in question_comma_ 0 for the others .
E99-1021.txt,95,Thus_comma_ the greater the response variable of a certain author_comma_ the more likely to be the author of the text.
E99-1021.txt,96,Some statistics measuring the degree to which the regression functions fit the training data are presented in table 2.
E99-1021.txt,97,Notice that R e is the coefficient of determination defined as follows t R 2 j l  yj _ y 2 j l where n is the total number of training data texts _comma_ y is the mean response_comma_ 3j and yj are the estimated response and the training response value of the j th author respectively.
E99-1021.txt,98,Additionally_comma_ a significant F value implies that a statistically significant proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable is explained.
E99-1021.txt,100,Statistics of the Regression Functions.
E99-1021.txt,102,The Test Corpus in the Space of the First Two Principal Components.
E99-1021.txt,105,Approximately 65 of the average identification error corresponds to three authors_comma_ namely A01_comma_ A05_comma_ and A08.
E99-1021.txt,106,Notice that these are the authors with an average text size smaller than 1_comma_000 words see table 1 .
E99-1021.txt,107,It appears_comma_ therefore_comma_ that a text sample of relatively short size i.e._comma_ less than 1_comma_000 words is not adequate for the representation of the stylistic characteristics of an author s style.
E99-1021.txt,108,Notice that similar conclusions are drawn by Biber 1990 1993 .
E99-1021.txt,109,Instead of trying to identify who the author of a text is_comma_ some applications require the verification of the hypothesis that a given person is the author of the text.
E99-1021.txt,110,In such a case_comma_ only the response function of the author in question is involved.
E99-1021.txt,111,Towards this end_comma_ a threshold value has to be defined for each response function.
E99-1021.txt,112,Thus_comma_ if the response value for the given author is greater than the threshold then the author is accepted.

E99-1021.txt,115,FR_comma_ FA_comma_ and Mean Error as Functions of Subdivisions of R. certain author_comma_ we defined False Rejection FR and False Acceptance FA as follows FR rejected texts of the author total texts of the author FA accepted texts of the author total text of other authors Similar measures are widely utilized in the area of speaker recognition in speech processing Fakotakis_comma_ et al._comma_ 1993 .
E99-1021.txt,116,The multiple correlation coefficient R x R 2 of a regression function see table 2 equals 1 if the fitted equation passes through all the data points.
E99-1021.txt,117,At the other extreme_comma_ it equals 0.
E99-1021.txt,118,The fluctuation of average FR_comma_ FA_comma_ and mean error i.e._comma_ FR FA 2 for the entire test corpus using subdivisions of R as threshold x axis is shown in figure 2_comma_ and the minimum mean error corresponds to R 2.
E99-1021.txt,119,Notice that by choosing the threshold based on the minimal mean error the majority of applications is covered.
E99-1021.txt,120,On the other hand_comma_ some applications require either minimal FR or FA_comma_ and this fact has to be taken into account during the selection of the threshold.
E99-1021.txt,121,The results of the author verification experiment using R 2 as threshold are presented in table 4.
E99-1021.txt,122,Approximately 70 of the total false rejection corresponds to the authors A01_comma_ A05_comma_ A08 as in the case of author identification.
E99-1021.txt,123,On the other hand_comma_ false acceptance seems to be highly relevant to the threshold value.
E99-1021.txt,124,The smaller the threshold value_comma_ the greater the false acceptance.
E99-1021.txt,125,Thus_comma_ the authors A03_comma_ A04_comma_ A05_comma_ and A08 are responsible for 72 of the total false acceptance error.
E99-1021.txt,127,Author Verification Results threshold R 2 .
E99-1018.txt,1,paper presents a decision tree approach to the problems of part ofspeech disambiguation and unknown word guessing as they appear in Modem Greek_comma_ a highly inflectional language. The learning procedure is tag set independent and reflects the linguistic reasoning on the specific problems.
E99-1018.txt,2,The decision trees induced are combined with a highcoverage lexicon to form a tagger that achieves 93_comma_5 overall disambiguation accuracy.
E99-1018.txt,4,Part of speech POS taggers are software devices that aim to assign unambiguous morphosyntactic tags to words of electronic texts.
E99-1018.txt,5,Although the hardest part of the tagging process is performed by a computational lexicon_comma_ a POS tagger cannot solely consist of a lexicon due to i morphosyntactic ambiguity e.g._comma_ love as verb or noun and ii the existence of unknown words e.g._comma_ proper nouns_comma_ place names_comma_ compounds_comma_ etc. .
E99-1018.txt,6,When the lexicon can assure high coverage_comma_ unknown word guessing can be viewed as a decision taken upon the POS of open class words i.e._comma_ Noun_comma_ Verb_comma_ Adjective_comma_ Adverb or Participle .
E99-1018.txt,7,Towards the disambiguation of POS tags_comma_ two main approaches have been followed.
E99-1018.txt,8,On one hand_comma_ according to the linguistic approach_comma_ experts encode handcrafted rules or constraints based on .
E99-1035.txt,1,report describes the development of a parsing system for written Swedish and is focused on a grammar_comma_ the main component of the system_comma_ semiautomatically extracted from corpora. A cascaded_comma_ finite state algorithm is applied to the grammar in which the input contains coarse grained semantic class information_comma_ and the output produced reflects not only the syntactic structure of the input_comma_ but grammatical functions as well.
E99-1035.txt,2,The grammar has been tested on a variety of random samples of different text genres_comma_ achieving precision and recall of 94.62 and 91.92 respectively_comma_ and average crossing rate of 0.04_comma_ when evaluated against manually disambiguated_comma_ annotated texts.
E99-1035.txt,4,This report describes a parsing system for fast and accurate analysis of large bodies of written Swedish.
E99-1035.txt,5,The grammar has been implemented in a modular fashion as finite state_comma_ cascaded machines_comma_ henceforth called Cass SWE_comma_ a name adopted from the parser used_comma_ Cascaded analysis of syntactic structure_comma_ Abney_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1035.txt,6,CassSWE operates on part of speech annotated texts and is coupled with a pre processing mechanism_comma_ which distinguishes thousands of phrasal verbs_comma_ idioms_comma_ and multi word expressions.
E99-1035.txt,7,Cass SWE is designed in such a way that semantic information_comma_ inherited by named entity NE identification software_comma_ is taken under consideration and grammatical functions are extracted heuristically using finite state transducers.
E99-1035.txt,8,The grammar has been manually acquired from open source texts by observing legitimately adjacent_comma_ part of speech chains_comma_ and how and which function words signal boundaries between phrasal constituents and clauses.
E99-1035.txt,9,2 Background 2.1 Cascaded Finite State Automata Finite state technology has had a great impact on a variety of Natural Language Processing applications_comma_ as well as in industrial and academic Language Engineering.
E99-1035.txt,10,Attractive properties_comma_ such as conceptual simplicity_comma_ flexibility_comma_ and space and time efficiency_comma_ have motivated researchers to create grammars for natural language using finitestate methods Koskenniemi et al. 1992 Appelt et al. 1993 Roche 1996 Roche Schabes 1997 .
E99-1035.txt,13,2.2 Swedish Finite State Grammars There have been few attempts in the past to model Swedish grammars using finite state methods.
E99-1035.txt,15,Church at MIT implemented a Swedish_comma_ regularexpression grammar_comma_ inspired by ideas from Ejerhed Church 1983 .
E99-1035.txt,16,Unfortunately_comma_ the lexicon and the rules were designed to parse a very limited set of sentences.
E99-1035.txt,17,In Ejerhed 1985 _comma_ a very 245 Proceedings of EACL 99 general description of Swedish grammar was presented.
E99-1035.txt,18,Its algorithmic details were unclear_comma_ and we are unaware of any descriptions in the literature of large scale applications or implementations of the models presented.
E99-1035.txt,19,It seems to us that Swedish language researchers are satisfied with the description and_comma_ apparently_comma_ the implementation on a small scale of finite state methods for noun phrases only_comma_ Cooper_comma_ 1984 Rauch_comma_ 1993 .
E99-1035.txt,20,However_comma_ large scale grammars for Swedish do exist_comma_ employing other approaches to parsing_comma_ either radically different_comma_ such as the Swedish Core Language Engine_comma_ Gamb ck Rayner_comma_ 1992 _comma_ or slightly different_comma_ such as the Swedish Constraint Grammar_comma_ Birn_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1035.txt,21,2.3 Pre Processing By pre processing we mean i the recognition of multi word tokens_comma_ phrasal verbs and idioms ii sentence segmentation iii part of speech tagging using Brill s 1994 part of speech tagger_comma_ and the EAGLES tagset for Swedish_comma_ JohanssonKokkinakis Kokkinakis_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1035.txt,22,The general accuracy of the tagger is at the 96 level_comma_ 98_comma_7 for the evaluation presented in table 1 .
E99-1035.txt,23,Tagging errors do not influence critically the performance of Cass SWE 1 cf. Voutilainen_comma_ 1998 iv semantic inheritance in the form of NE labels time sequences_comma_ locations_comma_ persons_comma_ organizations_comma_ communication and transportation means_comma_ money expressions and body part.
E99-1035.txt,24,The recognition is performed using finite state recognizers based on trigger words_comma_ typical contexts_comma_ and typical predicates associated with the entities.
E99-1035.txt,25,The performance of the NE recognition for Swedish is 97.4 precision_comma_ and 93.5 recall_comma_ tested within the AVENTINUS 2 domain.
E99-1035.txt,26,Cass SWE has been integrated in the General Architecture for Text Engineering GATE _comma_ Cunningham et al. 1996 .
E99-1035.txt,27,3 The Grammar Framework The Swedish grammar has been semiautomatically extracted from written text corpora by observing two phenomena i which part of speech n grams_comma_ are not allowed to be adjacent to each other in a constituent_comma_ and ii 1The parser can be tolerant of the errofieous annotation returned by the tagger_comma_ e.g. in the distinction between Swedish adjective participles in t .
E99-1035.txt,28,This is accomplished by constructing rules that contain either adjective or participle in the following manner np  AKTICLE ADJECTIVEIPARTICIPLE NOUN 2AVENTINUS LE 2238 _comma_ Advanced Information System for Multilingual Drug Enforcement. http svenska.gu.se aventinus how and which function words signal boundaries between phrases and clauses.
E99-1035.txt,29,i uses the Mutual Information_comma_ statistics_comma_ based on the n grams.
E99-1035.txt,30,Low n gram frequencies_comma_ such as verb noun determiner_comma_ gave reliable cues for clause boundary_comma_ while high values such as numeral noun did not_comma_ and thus rejected.
E99-1035.txt,31,Observation i is related to the notion of distituent grammars_comma_ ...a distituent grammar is a list of tag pairs which cannot be adjacent within a constituent... _comma_ Magerman Marcus 1990 ii is a supplement of i _comma_ which recognizes formal indicators of subordination co ordination_comma_ such as conjunctions_comma_ subjunctions_comma_ and punctuation.
E99-1035.txt,32,3.1 Syntactic Labelling and the Underlying Corpus The syntactic analysis is completed through the recognition of a variety of phrasal constituents_comma_ sentential clauses_comma_ and subclauses.
E99-1035.txt,33,We follow the proposal defined by the EAGLES 1996 _comma_ Syntactic Annotation Group_comma_ which recognizes a number of syntactic_comma_ metasymbolic categories that are subsumed in most current categories of constituency based syntactic annotation.
E99-1035.txt,34,The labelled bracketing consists of the syntactic category of the phrasal constituent enclosed between brackets.
E99-1035.txt,35,Unlabelled bracketing is only adopted in cases of unrecognized syntactic constructions.
E99-1035.txt,36,The corpora we used consisted of a variety of different sources_comma_ about 200_comma_000 tokens_comma_ collected in AVENTINUS.
E99-1035.txt,37,The rules are divided into levels_comma_ with each level consisting of groups of patterns ordered according to their internal complexity and length.
E99-1035.txt,38,A pattern consists of a category and a regular expression.
E99-1035.txt,39,The regular expressions are translated into finite state automata_comma_ and the union of the automata yields a single_comma_ deterministic_comma_ finite state_comma_ level recognizer_comma_ Abney_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1035.txt,40,Moreover_comma_ there is also the possibility of grouping words and or part of speech tags using morphological and semantic criteria.
E99-1035.txt,41,3.2 Grammar Rules Some of the most important groups include Noun Phrases_comma_ Grammar0 the number of patterns in grammar0 is 180_comma_ divided in six different groups_comma_ depending on the length and complexity of the patterns.
E99-1035.txt,42,A large number of parallel coordination rules are also implemented at this level_comma_ depending on the similarity of the conjuncts with respect to several different characteristics_comma_ cf. Nagao_comma_ 1992 . Prepositional Phrases_comma_ Grammar1 the majority of prepositional phrases are noun 246 Proceedings of EACL 99 phrases preceded by a preposition.
E99-1035.txt,43,Trapped adverbials_comma_ belonging to the noun phrase and not identified while applying grammar0_comma_ are merged within the np.
E99-1035.txt,44,Both simple and multiword prepositions are used. Verbal Groups_comma_ Grammar2 identifies and labels phrasal_comma_ non phrasal_comma_ and complex verbal formations.
E99-1035.txt,45,The rules allow for any number of auxiliary verbs_comma_ possible intervening adverbs_comma_ and end with a main verb or particle.
E99-1035.txt,46,A distinction is made between finite infinite active passive verbal groups. Clauses_comma_ Grammar3 and Grammar4 the clause resolution is based on surface criteria_comma_ outlined at the beginning of this chapter_comma_ and the rather fixed word order of Swedish.
E99-1035.txt,47,Grammar3 distinguishes different types of subordinate clauses while Grammar4 recognizes main clauses.
E99-1035.txt,48,A unique level is designated for each type of clause 3.3 Grammatical Functions Grammatical functions are heuristically recognized using the topographical scheme_comma_ originally developed for Danish_comma_ in which the relative position of all functional elements in the clause is mapped in the sentence_comma_ Diderichsen_comma_ 1966 .
E99-1035.txt,49,3.4 An Example The following short example illustrates the input and output to Cass SWE Under 1998 gick 8 799 fSretag i konkurs i Sverige. _comma_ i.e.
E99-1035.txt,50,During 1998_comma_ 8 799 companies went bankrupt in Sweden. The input to Cass SWE is an annotated version of the text Under S 1998 MC tim gick YMISh 8_799 MC f6retag NCN SP NI org i S konkurs NCUSNI i S Sverige NP icg. F .
E99-1035.txt,52,The output produced reflects the coarse grained semantics and part of speech used in the input_comma_ as well as the head of each phrase and the grammatical functions TIME_comma_ SUBJ ect and P 0BJ ect .
E99-1035.txt,53,4 Evaluation The performance of the parser partly depends on the output of the tagger and the rest of the preprocessing software.
E99-1035.txt,54,Our way of dealing with how correct the performance of the parser is_comma_ follows a practical_comma_ pragmatic approach_comma_ based on consultation of modern Swedish syntax literature.
E99-1035.txt,55,We use the metrics precision P _comma_ recall R _comma_ F value F and cross bracketed rate.
E99-1035.txt,56,F  2 1 PR 2 P R_comma_ where is a parameter encoding the relative importance of R and P here 1.
E99-1035.txt,57,Evaluation is performed automatically using the evalb evaluation software_comma_ Sekine Collins_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1035.txt,58,4.1 Gold Standard and Error Analysis For the evaluation of Cass SWE we use three types of texts i a sample taken from a manually annotated Swedish corpus of 100_comma_000 words with grammatical information SynTag_comma_ J rborg_comma_ 1990 ii newspaper material and iii a test suite_comma_ for non common constructions_comma_ by consulting Swedish syntax literature.
E99-1035.txt,59,Texts ii and iii were annotated manually.
E99-1035.txt,60,The total number of tokens was 1_comma_500 and sentences 117.
E99-1035.txt,61,The evaluation results are given in Table 1 _comma_ for both noun phrases NPs _comma_ and full chunk parsing All .
E99-1035.txt,62,The errors found can he divided into i Table h Cass SWE_comma_ Performance P R F NPs 97.82 All 94.62 Cross 94.52 96.17 0.03 91.92 93.2 7 0.04 errors in the texts themselves_comma_ which we cannot control and are difficult to discover if the texts are not proofread prior to processing ii errors produced by the tagger and iii grammatical errors produced by the parser_comma_ caused mainly by the lack of an appropriate pattern in the rules_comma_ and almost exclusively in higher order clauses due to 247 Proceedings of EACL 99 structural ambiguity and coordination problems.
E99-1035.txt,63,None of the errors in i and ii have been manually corrected.
E99-1035.txt,64,This was a conscious choice_comma_ so that the evaluation of the parsing will be based on unrestricted data.
E99-1035.txt,65,5 Conclusion We have described the implementation of a large coverage parser for Swedish_comma_ following the cascaded finite state approach.
E99-1035.txt,66,Our main guidance towards the grammar development was the observation of how and which function words behave as delimiters between different phrases_comma_ as well as which other part of speech tags are not allowed to be adjacent within a constituent.
E99-1035.txt,67,Cass SWE operates on part of speech annotated texts using coarse grained semantic information_comma_ and produces output that reflects this information as well as grammatical functions in the output.
E99-1035.txt,68,A corpus_comma_ annotated syntactically_comma_ is a rich source of information which we intend to use for a number of applications_comma_ e.g. information extraction an intermediate step in the extraction of lexical semantic information making valency lexicons more comprehensive by extracting sub categorization information_comma_ and syntactic relations. .
E99-1039.txt,1,inheritance is a useful tool for encoding linguistic generalisations that have exceptions. In this paper we show how the use of an order independent typed default unification operation can provide non redundant highly structured and concise representation to specify a network of lexical types_comma_ that encodes linguistic information about verbal subcategorisation.
E99-1039.txt,2,The system of lexical types is based on the one proposed by Pollard and Sag 1987 _comma_ but uses the more expressive typed default feature structures_comma_ is more succinct_comma_ and able to express linguistic sub regularities more elegantly.
E99-1039.txt,4,Several authors have highlighted the importance of using defaults in the representation of linguistic knowledge_comma_ in order to get linguistically adequate descriptions for some natural language phenomena Gazdar_comma_ 1987 _comma_ Bouma_comma_ 1992 _comma_ Daelemans et al_comma_ 1992 _comma_ Briscoe_comma_ 1993 .
E99-1039.txt,5,Defaults have been used in the definition of inflectional morphology_comma_ specification of lexical semantics_comma_ analysis of gapping constructions and ellipsis among others.
E99-1039.txt,6,In this paper we use defaults to structure the lexicon_comma_ concentrating on the description of verbal subcategorisation information.
E99-1039.txt,7,The issue of how to organise lexical information is especially important when a lexicalised formalism like Categorial Grammar CG or HeadDriven Phrase Structure Grammar HPSG is employed_comma_ since the burden of linguistic description is concentrated in the lexicon and if lexical entries are organised as unrelated lists_comma_ there is a significant loss of generalisation and an increase in redundancy.
E99-1039.txt,8,Alternatively_comma_ it is possible to use inheritance networks_comma_ which provide representations that are able to capture linguistic regularities about classes of items that behave similarly.
E99-1039.txt,9,This idea is employed in Pollard and Sag s 1987 sketch of an HPSG lexicon as a monotonic multiple orthogonal inheritance type hierarchy.
E99-1039.txt,10,However_comma_ this work fail to make use of defaults_comma_ which would significantly reduce redundancy in lexical specifications and would enable them to elegantly express sub regularities Krieger and Nerbonne_comma_ 1993 .
E99-1039.txt,11,In this paper we demonstrate that using default unification_comma_ namely the order independent and persistent version of default unification described in Lascarides et al_comma_ 1996b and Lascarides and Copestake_comma_ 1999 _comma_ to implement a default inheritance network results in a fully declarative specification of a lexical fragment based on Pollard and Sag s 1987 _comma_ but that is both more succinct and able to express elegantly linguistic sub regularities_comma_ such as the marked status of subject control of transitive subject control verbs.
E99-1039.txt,12,In section 2_comma_ a brief description of the use of defaults and YADU is given.
E99-1039.txt,13,In section 3_comma_ we present the results of representing the proposed lexical fragment in terms of default multiple inheritance networks.
E99-1039.txt,14,Finally_comma_ we discuss the results achieved and future work.
E99-1039.txt,15,2 Default Inheritance and YADU In this work_comma_ a default multiple orthogonal inheritance network is used to represent lexical information.
E99-1039.txt,16,Thus_comma_ with different subnetworks used to encode different kinds of linguistic knowledge_comma_ the idea is that linguistic regularities are encoded near the top of the network_comma_ while nodes further down the network are used to represent sub regularities or exceptions.
E99-1039.txt,17,Such an approach to representing the lexicon has some advantages_comma_ like its ability to capture linguistic generalisations_comma_ conciseness_comma_ uniformity_comma_ ease of maintenance and modification_comma_ and modularity Daelemans et al_comma_ 1992 .
E99-1039.txt,18,This default multiple inheritance network is im261 Proceedings of EACL 99 plemented using YADU Lascarides and Copestake_comma_ 1999 _comma_ which is an order independent default unification operation on typed feature structures TFS .
E99-1039.txt,19,YADU uses an extended definition of TFSS called typed default feature structures TDFSs _comma_ to explicitly distinguish the non default information from the default one_comma_ where a TDFS is composed by an indefeasible TFS I _comma_ which contains the non default information and a defeasible TFS D _comma_ which contains the default information_comma_ with a  separating these two TFSS I on the left hand and D on the right hand .
E99-1039.txt,20,As a consequence_comma_ during default unification non default information can always be preserved and only consistent default information is incorporated into the defeasible TFS.
E99-1039.txt,21,Another important point is that default unification of two feature structures is deterministic_comma_ always returning a single value.
E99-1039.txt,22,Moreover_comma_ default specifications can be made to act as indefeasible information_comma_ using YADU s DefFill operation Lascarides and Copestake_comma_ 1999 _comma_ that has a TDFS as input and returns a TFS by incorporating all the default information into the indefeasible TFS_comma_ say at the interface between the lexicon and the rest of the system.
E99-1039.txt,23,YADU also provides the possibility of defining defaults that are going to persist outside the lexicon_comma_ with the p operator Lascarides et al_comma_ 1996b _comma_ which was already shown to be significant_comma_ for example_comma_ for the interface between the lexicon and pragmatics_comma_ where lexically encoded semantic defaults can be overridden by discourse information Lascarides et al_comma_ 1996a .
E99-1039.txt,24,Furthermore_comma_ YADU supports the definition of inequalities_comma_ which are used to override default reentrancies when no conflicting values are defined in the types involved Lascarides and Copestake_comma_ 1999 .
E99-1039.txt,25,YADU  can be informally defined as an operation that takes two TDFSS and produces a new one_comma_ whose indefeasible part is the result of unifying the indefeasible information defined in the input TDFSs and the defeasible part is the result of combining the indefeasible part with the maximal set of compatible default elements_comma_ according to type specificity_comma_ as shown in the example below.
E99-1039.txt,26,Throughout this paper we adopt the abbreviatory notation from Lascarides et al_comma_ 1996b where Indefensible De feasible is abbreviated to Indefeasible if Indefeasible Defensible and T Defeasible is abbreviated to Defensible. t t I n  D  For a more detailed .
E99-1017.txt,1,sensitive rewrite rules have been widely used in several areas of natural language processing_comma_ including syntax_comma_ morphology_comma_ phonology and speech processing. Kaplan and Kay_comma_ Karttunen_comma_ and Mohri Sproat have given various algorithms to compile such rewrite rules into finite state transducers.
E99-1017.txt,2,The present paper extends this work by allowing a limited form of backreferencing in such rules.
E99-1017.txt,3,The explicit use of backreferencing leads to more elegant and general solutions.
E99-1017.txt,5,Context sensitive rewrite rules have been widely used in several areas of natural language processing.
E99-1017.txt,6,Johnson 1972 has shown that such rewrite rules are equivalent to finite state transducers in the special case that they are not allowed to rewrite their own output.
E99-1017.txt,7,An algorithm for compilation into transducers was provided by Kaplan and Kay 1994 .
E99-1017.txt,8,Improvements and extensions to this algorithm have been provided by Karttunen 1995 _comma_ Karttunen 1997 _comma_ Karttunen 1996 and Mohri and Sproat 1996 .
E99-1017.txt,9,In this paper_comma_ the algorithm will be extended to provide a limited form of backreferencing.
E99-1017.txt,10,Backreferencing has been implicit in previous research_comma_ such as in the batch rules of Kaplan and Kay 1994 _comma_ bracketing transducers for finite state parsing Karttunen_comma_ 1996 _comma_ and the LocalExtension operation of Roche and Schabes 1995 .
E99-1017.txt,11,The explicit use of backreferencing leads to more elegant and general solutions.
E99-1017.txt,12,Backreferencing is widely used in editors_comma_ scripting languages and other tools employing regular expressions Friedl_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1017.txt,15,Unrestricted use of backreferencing thus can introduce non regular languages.
E99-1017.txt,16,For NLP finite state calculi Karttunen et al._comma_ 1996 van Noord_comma_ 1997 this is unacceptable.

E99-1033.txt,1,this paper we propose a methodology for investigating the relationship between architectures of natural language generation NLG systems and stylistic properties of texts. Biber s 1988 methodology is used to obtain both the characterisation of style of our corpus and the division of the corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts.
E99-1033.txt,2,These sets will be used for studying the architectural aspects.
E99-1033.txt,4,We started our research with a survey of 19 applied natural language generation NLG systems Paiva_comma_ 1998 and noticed that almost all the systems followed a pipeline model there was a general agreement on the core NLG tasks that a system should perform e.g._comma_ aggregation_comma_ lexicalisation_comma_ etc.  the surveyed systems mainly differed on the order the NLG tasks are executed see Cahill et al._comma_ 1999 We also noticed that the texts produced by the various systems were apparently quite different stylistically although we did not have a formal method to measure how much different they were and_comma_ in order to explain how this variety of texts was obtained with the same type of architecture i.e._comma_ pipeline _comma_ we have put forward the hypothesis that the order in which the NLG tasks are executed influences the kind of text that can be obtained_comma_ i.e. a certain order would facilitate the generation of a certain type of text whilst another would not.
E99-1033.txt,5,This hypothesis goes in line with other researchers results which purport to show that architectural aspects of a NLG system depend on the characteristics of the text to be generated and vice versa.
E99-1033.txt,6,For instance 237 Robin 1994 argues for a revisionincremental architecture for the generation of structurally complex text with floating content i.e._comma_ content that can appear anywhere in the text and is opportunistically realised only if stylistic factors of the surrounding text allow Inui and colleagues 1992 conclude that in order to avoid the generation of text with ambiguous and complex sentences a revision architecture is necessary_comma_ with the revision module placed at the end of the generation process i.e._comma_ after the linguistic realisation l Reiter ms. reports that pipeline architectures cannot deal with constraints on the length of a text.
E99-1033.txt,7,It is difficult however to reconcile their results in a unified perspective since each of these reported works started with a different perspective and_comma_ generally_comma_ had different aims in mind.
E99-1033.txt,8,We believe that it is possible to relate those characteristics of text presented above such as complexity_comma_ ambiguity and sentence length 2 to style_comma_ 3 and that we can gain insight into NLG architectures having a systematic way to classify texts by their stylistic properties so that we can analyse the architectural aspects in relation to this stylistic classification.
E99-1033.txt,9,We then start with the point of view that it is reasonable to assume that certain styles of text demand a more specialised type of architecture than others for example_comma_ a revision versus a pipeline architecture 4 and our idea is to develop a methodology for studying which are the approSome aspects related to the complexity of a sentence e.g._comma_ sentence length can only be measured precisely when the text has already been generated.
E99-1033.txt,10,2 For instance_comma_ complexity and lack of ambiguity are factors that can be related to the clarity of a text.
E99-1033.txt,11,3 Depending on the definition we assume for it.
E99-1033.txt,12,4 For a classification of NLG architectures_comma_ see De Smedt et al._comma_ 1996 Proceedings of EACL 99 FORMALITY ENESS INTERACINENESS 7 i text type 2 text type 3 text type 1 _ r A B In this figure_comma_ one group expresses texts that are formal_comma_ concise_comma_ and not interactive text type 1 a possible example is news columns in scientific maga2ines .
E99-1033.txt,13,Another group text type 2 expresses texts that are informal_comma_ highly concise_comma_ and highly interactive e.g._comma_ short articles in IV magazines answering readers questions .
E99-1033.txt,14,A third one text type 3 can be considered neither formal nor informal_comma_ is not concise and has a medium value for interacfiveness.
E99-1033.txt,15,Figure 1 A flcti ous example of the charactedsation of text types in terms of three stylistic parameters A _comma_ and the partition of the corpus into three text types B . priate architectures for the generation of texts in a specific style or more than one style.
E99-1033.txt,16,Hovy 1988 used a similar approach but characterised style in such an informal way that its relation to architectural aspects was compromised in particular_comma_ he could not ensure that he was not missing important relations between style and generator decisions s.
E99-1033.txt,17,In this paper we will present a characterisation of style and an approach for dealing with it which_comma_ we hope_comma_ will provide a means to clarify the interaction between the architectures of NLG systems and the type of texts they can_comma_ or need to_comma_ generate.
E99-1033.txt,18,The paper continues in the following way in Section 2 we present the definition of style we are working with and in Section 3 we show how this characterisation will help us to deal with aspects of architecture.
E99-1033.txt,19,In Section 4 we discuss the expected results and_comma_ finally_comma_ we conclude by presenting where we are in this process.
E99-1033.txt,20,2 Investigating Style We use the term style to signify the variability in the use of features of a language that can be correlated with certain types of situation where situation can be regarded as the context within which interaction of the speech event occurs Brown and Fraser_comma_ 1979 p. 34 _comma_ involving the participants_comma_ the setting and the purposes of the communication.
E99-1033.txt,21,In order to put this definition to work on our problem_comma_ first we need to know how to obtain the set of stylistic parameters_comma_ i.e._comma_ the parameters that_comma_ when varied_comma_ will be responsible for producing texts in different styles.
E99-1033.txt,23,For the first part_comma_ there are two approaches in the literature linking stylistic parameters to characteristics of texts.
E99-1033.txt,24,We have already cited Hovy 1988 and its main problem the lack of formality.
E99-1033.txt,25,DiMarco s 1990 approach was to construct a stylistic grammar using the notion of norm and deviation from norm see_comma_ e.g._comma_ Enkvist 1973 .
E99-1033.txt,26,While this approach is enough to obtain the stylistic parameters 6_comma_ we think that this characterisation brings a problem for grouping texts into sets it can create only two sets for studying the texts that agree with the norm and those that do not.
E99-1033.txt,27,This can be a problem because_comma_ although the texts following the norm will comprise a set of similar texts_comma_ those in the deviant set can be so dissimilar that any type of analysis based on them and_comma_ consequently_comma_ its interpretation in architectural terms is probably doomed to failure.
E99-1033.txt,28,In our approach we will avoid these problems by following a methodology that can provide two things 1 a characterisation of the stylistic parameters of a corpus 7_comma_ and 2 a partition of a corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts.
E99-1033.txt,29,We are working with Biber s 1988 methodology.
E99-1033.txt,30,From a corpus tagged with a comprehensive set of linguistic features of English_comma_ we obtain the frequency count associated with each one Using a statistical factor analysis_comma_ we group the linguistic features that co occur_comma_ considering each group 6 DiMarco refers to them as stylistic goals .
E99-1033.txt,31,7 Our corpus comprises texts written for two different audiences patients and doctors of more than 250 pharmaceutical products in total it is more than 500 texts. s There are two levels of tagging.
E99-1033.txt,32,First_comma_ the corpus is tagged using Brill s 1994 tagger.
E99-1033.txt,33,Secondly_comma_ programs for counting specific configurations of tags are run.
E99-1033.txt,34,The process is completely automatic.
E99-1033.txt,35,Proceedings of EACL 99 a stylistic parameter 9 that can then be analysed in functional terms_comma_ l Several stylistic parameters can emerge from a corpus_comma_ each text of the corpus having a specific value for each of them see an example with three stylistic parameters in Figure l A .
E99-1033.txt,36,Our interest in Biber s work is also related to his definition of text types the texts within each type are maximally similar with respect to their linguistic characteristics_comma_ while the types are maximally distinct with respect to their linguistic characteristics Biber 1995 _comma_ p.
E99-1033.txt,38,In order to obtain the text types_comma_ a cluster analysis is used and results in the partitioning of the corpus i.e._comma_ the texts with similar values for all the stylistic parameters will be grouped in a partition see Figure I B .
E99-1033.txt,39,Following this procedure will allow us to analyse aspects of architecture for each text type i.e._comma_ each partition in isolation and_comma_ more importantly_comma_ make cross comparisons among these analyses.
E99-1033.txt,40,3 Relating Style to Architecture We are using NLG tasks as the basis for our approach to relate style to NIX3 architectures.
E99-1033.txt,41,We are working with a set of core NLG task that we have found to be stable all of them occurred in almost all the systems we surveyed Paiva_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1033.txt,42,The set comprises the following tasks content determination_comma_ rhetorical structuring_comma_ lexicalisation_comma_ intra and inter sentential ordering_comma_ referring expression generation_comma_ aggregation_comma_ segmentation_comma_ and linguistic realisation for an explanation about those task_comma_ see Cahill et al._comma_ 1999 . l Part of the process for relating style to architecture is depicted in Figure 2.
E99-1033.txt,43,As shown_comma_ we start by analysing the NLG tasks that are responsible for the presence of a specific linguistic feature arrow B .
E99-1033.txt,44,The association of stylistic parameters with linguistic features obtained in the corpus analysis arrow A will be used to observe which NLG tasks are responsible for 9 Biber refers to this as a dimension of register variation .
E99-1033.txt,45,raThe assumption is that strong co occurrence patterns of linguistic features mark underlying functional dimensions Biber_comma_ 1988 p. 13 .
E99-1033.txt,46,Notice that the name of each stylistic parameter_comma_ per se_comma_ means nothing it is the linguistic features grouped in each stylistic parameter that are important
E99-1033.txt,47,Nonetheless_comma_ it is easier to refer to a stylistic parameter by its name than to the set of linguistic features it represents.
E99-1033.txt,48,So below we say that a certain text is formal_comma_ when_comma_ in fact_comma_ we want to say that it has certain linguistic features such as passives_comma_ formal words_comma_ conjuncts_comma_ etc. We are aware that some of those tasks can be subdivided and that some authors assume different names for2l same task.
E99-1033.txt,49,If necessary_comma_ we will do extensions to this set. specific values of a stylistic parameter arrow C .
E99-1033.txt,50,12 Then we will observe the combinations of the NLG tasks in accordance with each text type partition obtained in the corpus analysis.
E99-1033.txt,51,This will give us an idea of which NLG tasks are most responsible for the linguistic features associated with the different text types also_comma_ it will show us how the tasks are working because of the links to the linguistic features see Figure 2 .
E99-1033.txt,52,The result of this process will be sets of NLG tasks for each text type.  Eg. conjuncls g._comma_ hoMeveC _comma_ in com _comma_  amp _comma_ ... Figure 2 Relating values of style parameters to NLG tasks a fictitious example supposing formality as a stylistic parameter.
E99-1033.txt,53,Our work then will be to observe the NLG tasks inside each text type first_comma_ but making crosscomparisons among text types afterwards attacking the questions related to architecture_comma_ i.e._comma_ which kind of modularisation and interaction between modules is necessary appropriate _comma_ which resources are used _comma_ what kind of data the modules tasks exchange _comma_ etc. We will investigate architectural decisions at three different levels at the task level how can a certain task be made sensitive to values of stylistic parameters at the level of tasks interaction is there a natural ordering of tasks for a certain type of text
E99-1033.txt,54,13 at the global level assuming that tasks are normally encapsulated inside modules_comma_ what characteristics of texts force the interaction between modules to be more intense
E99-1033.txt,55,2The statistical method by which arrow A in Figure 2 is derived gives a measure of how important the linguistic feature is for a certain stylistic parameter.
E99-1033.txt,56,SSee Danlos 1984 for examples of how the order of execution of tasks can favour a certain textual result over another.
E99-1033.txt,57,Proceedings of EACL 99 Faced with this classification we will propose solutions that can be used in the specification of an architecture that supports the generation of texts in different styles.
E99-1033.txt,58,We expect these solutions to lead to useful guidelines for helping designers of NLG systems to choose the appropriate architecture for the type of text they want their system to generate.
E99-1033.txt,59,4 Discussion One may question why we are repeating Biber s experiment_comma_ when he has already obtained a set of stylistic parameters and a set of text types.
E99-1033.txt,60,It is possible that other results emerge from applying his methodology to our corpus_comma_ and the only way to know this will be by re doing the analysis.
E99-1033.txt,61,It is also possible that we obtain a subset of his results_comma_ which will at least make our task a more manageable one.
E99-1033.txt,62,We believe that our result will be of general utility.
E99-1033.txt,63,Although the precise set of stylistic parameters may be dependent on the corpus one is using_comma_ we expect that the set of valid task interaction patterns will be restricted_comma_ and that the text types emerging from our study will encompass most of the valid patterns.
E99-1033.txt,64,Our programs for counting the linguistic features will be made available for others to use.
E99-1033.txt,65,5 Conclusion In this paper we propose a methodology for investigating the relationship between architectures of NLG systems and stylistic properties of the texts they can generate.
E99-1033.txt,66,Although we are still undertaking the first steps of our methodology the corpus analysis _comma_ we believe that this methodology will allow us to test the hypothesis regarding the order of execution of NLG tasks_comma_ and at least provide initial indicators on the relationship between classes of architectures and the style of generated texts.

E99-1037.txt,1,a CALL environment Computerassisted language learning programs should ideally allow the learner to train his her communicative competence_comma_ which is one of the main goals of foreign language teaching nowadays. This can be reached by allowing learners to use and train their knowledge of a foreign language in realistic dialogue style exercises.
E99-1037.txt,2,All levels of linguistic and communicational analysis have to be considered to realize such a system.
E99-1037.txt,3,In this paper I will concentrate on the dialogue component of the concept_comma_ which relies on two main knowledge sources.
E99-1037.txt,4,The discourse grammar structures the dialogue elements or dialogue acts as possible parts of a dialogue and the dialogue knowledge base provides the possible contents of dialogues.
E99-1037.txt,5,Additionally_comma_ a framing discourse structure has to be built to provide the specific dialogue exercise.
E99-1037.txt,6,A FSA finite state automaton based on the discourse grammar determines the possible moves which the dialogue might take.
E99-1037.txt,7,On the one hand this concept is restricted enough to allow for relatively easy maintenance as well as expansion and on the other hand it is advanced enough to allow for simulated complex dialogues.
E99-1037.txt,9,Today the main goal in foreign language teaching is acquiring the so called communicative competence instead of only memorizing the structure of the language.
E99-1037.txt,10,This can be achieved by making active language production one of the main parts of the curriculum.
E99-1037.txt,11,Being an efficient part of the media to enhance the learning process_comma_ computers should present tasks that support the acquisition of communicative competence.
E99-1037.txt,12,In the present concept_comma_ a presentation of situations is suggested_comma_ in which the learner has to produce language_comma_ i.e. produce complete sentences in a simulated dialogue.
E99-1037.txt,13,Various program modules analyse the input linguistically_comma_ give feedback in case of errors and present appropriate reactions to continue the dialogue.
E99-1037.txt,14,This gives language learners a chance to use their knowledge of the second language in a meaningful situation apart from the class room setting.
E99-1037.txt,15,Three goals are of relevance 1 the language learner should be encouraged to enter free formed input instead of thinking about the expectation of the program 2 the program should offer reliable feedback to the learner about his her performance and 3 the program should be easily expandable.
E99-1037.txt,16,When one uses the program_comma_ a situation is presented to the learner in which s he is required to act in order to solve the particular problem at hand.
E99-1037.txt,17,For example_comma_ the learner is asked to buy tickets for a movie and has to engage in a written dialogue with the computer as the seller of the tickets.
E99-1037.txt,18,The motivation for the development of the system arises from the above mentioned pedagogical considerations and the insight that traditional language learning programs do offer only few or none of the features to reach the above mentioned goals.
E99-1037.txt,19,The main part of this paper_comma_ however_comma_ deals only with the computational aspects of the problem a possible way to implement such a dialogue component.
E99-1037.txt,20,In the next section I will focus on the dialogue component_comma_ which on the one hand allows the learner to communicate with the computer in various dialogue situations_comma_ and on the other hand is restricted enough to be easily expandable and maintainable and gives the possibility for advanced feedback.
E99-1037.txt,21,Finally I will give a 253 Proceedings of EACL 99 rough sketch of the complete system.
E99-1037.txt,22,2 Discourse Grammars One way of realizing such dialogues is to develop discourse grammars which describe the steps through distinct parts of dialogues.
E99-1037.txt,23,This possibility is chosen in the present concept_comma_ since it enables the learner to lead written_comma_ situation based dialogues almost as in the class room situation.
E99-1037.txt,24,The advantage of a discourse grammar over a completely plan based dialogue structure is the seperate representation of possible moves dialogue acts in Alexandersson et al. 1994 and the content of the discourse.
E99-1037.txt,25,The discourse grammar of an information gathering dialogue can be used while reporting an accident as well as while ordering a pizza.
E99-1037.txt,26,In the first case the police officer wants to know all about the accident and possible casualties and in the latter case the pizza delivery wants to know the toppings and size of the pizza.
E99-1037.txt,27,On the other hand guidance is needed for the learner in the CALL scenario.
E99-1037.txt,28,Systems like the one described in Carberry 1990 are much too open to be used for language learning.
E99-1037.txt,29,The system would not be able to give any feedback to the learner in case of erroneous input.
E99-1037.txt,30,Therefore the system uses only restricted knowledge about what types of input to expect and how to react to them since the general intentions of the learner are known to the system through the situation presented to the learner.
E99-1037.txt,31,In other NLP based systems like Herr Kommissar deSmedt_comma_ 1995 and LINGO Murray_comma_ 1995 _comma_ the dialogue with the system either allows only single question answer exchanges or is strongly embedded into the respective scenario.
E99-1037.txt,32,In the first case the structure of a complete dialogue does not become clear to the learner and the initiative is with the learner who might not know what to do.
E99-1037.txt,33,In the second case it is difficult to include new scenarios since not only the content of the new dialogue has to be coded but also the various dialogue structures.
E99-1037.txt,34,Moreover the design of a system might not allow for different types of dialogues The dialogue component contains two main knowledge bases The first one contains the discourse grammars_comma_ which structure so called goaldriven dialogues or task oriented dialogues .
E99-1037.txt,35,I The idea of discourse grammars as a means to handle dialogue situations is for instance presented in Fawcett and Taylor 1989 .
E99-1037.txt,36,The second knowledge base contains knowledge about the content of the dialogue itself.
E99-1037.txt,37,This data is used to infer a mean1 For a discussion about discourse grammars in general see e.g.
E99-1037.txt,38,Taylor et al. 1989 . ingful reaction to the input sentence.
E99-1037.txt,39,Additionally this base contains slots in which the information given by the learner is stored.
E99-1037.txt,40,The following figure shows a simplified part of a discourse grammar_comma_ which models an information gathering dialogue such as is necessary in the case of collecting information about an accident.
E99-1037.txt,41,Additional items of discourse grammars are of course needed_comma_ for example_comma_ to start and end a telephone call_comma_ etc. The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues_comma_ e.g.
E99-1037.txt,42,Carletta et al._comma_ 1997 .
E99-1037.txt,43,Here dialogues are analysed with the help of a Dialogue Structure Coding Scheme _comma_ which in particular contains only a limited number of possible moves between dialogue partners.
E99-1037.txt,44,A similar analysis was done in the preparational phase of the Verbmobil project Alexandersson et al._comma_ 1994 .
E99-1037.txt,45,In a dialogue system where the intentions of the dialogue partners are known and the fixed structures serve to assess the performance of the language learner_comma_ the restrictions will probably not make the overall behaviour of the system worse than more flexible dialogue systems. in f o_gather QUESTION open questions  interpretable uninterpretable answer answer CONFIRMs_.__. interpretable _____ INQUIRE answer no more uninterpretable questions answer I THANK ENDI Figure 1 Simplified discourse grammar The dialogue module uses a surrounding discourse grammar_comma_ which includes the grammar parts for starting and ending a telephone call etc. From here the information gathering structure is called to try to fill the variables in the dialogue knowledge base see below by asking the learner a question.
E99-1037.txt,46,This process is continued as long as there are open questions open questions or until the learner does not provide interpretable input even after a repeated question INQUIRE THANK.END .
E99-1037.txt,47,The dialogue knowledge base contains the data 254 Proceedings of EACL 99 necessary to lead a dialogue with a certain content.
E99-1037.txt,48,The data is organized in a hierarchical structure.
E99-1037.txt,49,In the police call example the root node consists of a slot with a first reaction of the officer greeting to be presented to the learner.
E99-1037.txt,50,The daughter nodes e.g. accident_comma_ theft contain some slots which are used for the actual presentation of reactions on the screen or for information storage and retrieval.
E99-1037.txt,51,Some slots are question for pieces of information This includes canned text_comma_ which is presented to the learner.
E99-1037.txt,52,For example the police officer might ask Are there any injured people . information about expected answer The semantic structure of the learner s input is checked against the content of this slot and in case of variables it is stored. keywords to match the learner s input In case the parser was not able to produce a semantic representation_comma_ the system retreats to keyword matching in order to provide at least some reaction. text as answer A sentence is passed to the learner to acknowledge or confirm the processing of the input So_comma_ there has been an accident. . In case the system chooses to ask a question based on the discourse grammar_comma_ the question from the appropriate slot in a daughter node topdown left right is passed to the learner.
E99-1037.txt,53,After the grammatical processing of the answer_comma_ the content is checked against the expected one.
E99-1037.txt,54,If they match_comma_ a confirmation may be passed to the learner and the next step in the discourse grammar is taken.
E99-1037.txt,55,If the answer was considered not appropriate for the question the system tries to find a response in a hierarchy of steps from world knowledge checking to simple keyword analysis.
E99-1037.txt,56,The final output can thus be from the same node_comma_ a subnode or from a more general independent source of possible reactions.
E99-1037.txt,57,Some mechanism has to manage the matching procedure of the sentence.
E99-1037.txt,58,Possible mechanisms thus include the content matches completely The system was able to recognize the input sentence as some meaningful reaction to the previous question or statement. the content fits only partly too general There are subnodes which inelude variables for more specific information. the content fits only partly only one aspect A general keyword based mechanism recognizes only parts of the expected input. If possible the learner is asked for further clarification. the content does not fit A question for rephrasal will be displayed to the learner. Additionally the learner might consult a helpfile with information about how to proceed in the current situation. A difficulty that might arise is the change of control or initiative between the dialogue partnets.
E99-1037.txt,59,Allowing the learner to take the initiative has several consequences_comma_ which are difficult to realize.
E99-1037.txt,60,In contrast to the present concept the dialogue module should include a language generation device to generate natural language output to database inquiries.
E99-1037.txt,61,From this follows that the dialogue knowledge base should not contain any contradictions etc. to allow for easy inference of possible answers to the input question.
E99-1037.txt,62,Finally in case the learner keeps on asking questions the system might fail to continue the dialogue in a meaningful way.
E99-1037.txt,63,Thus a system designed for the use by pupils must be rigid enough to deal with this kind of input.
E99-1037.txt,64,The seemingly limited flexibility in this system is not really a disadvantage_comma_ because 1 the learner is suppose d to act in a foreseeable way and 2 the system should give feedback in case of deviating action.
E99-1037.txt,65,Especially the latter seems only possible if a discourse grammar structures the moves which dialogue partners might take.
E99-1037.txt,66,3 System Overview The idea behind the system is to extend the types of training which the student gets in a class room setting into a computer.
E99-1037.txt,67,One important kind of training is the practising of dialogues.
E99-1037.txt,68,Therefore the program realizes small written dialogues for the learner to train her his communicative competence _comma_ as explained above.
E99-1037.txt,69,The system consists of four main modules.
E99-1037.txt,70,The dialogue control module mainly functions as an interface.
E99-1037.txt,71,It organizes the flow of the input data between the user interface and the various processing modules.
E99-1037.txt,72,Every input sentence is first passed to the linguistic module_comma_ which checks it for orthographic and syntactic errors.
E99-1037.txt,73,The orthographic check is done in the spirit of Oflazer 1996 .
E99-1037.txt,74,With 255 Proceedings of EACL 99 the help of a finite state recognizer mildly deviating strings are identified and correct versions are presented to the learner if necessary.
E99-1037.txt,75,The syntactic check follows a rather traditional path.
E99-1037.txt,76,The main work is done by a LFG parser Bresnan and Kaplan_comma_ 1982 _comma_ originally implemented by Avery Andrews Australian National University and now modified to suit the needs of error detection with the help of modified grammar processing including error rules Kriiger et al._comma_ 1997 .
E99-1037.txt,77,As a next step the analysis of the sentence is checked against a world knowledge base_comma_ from which feedback follows to the learner if the sentence does not match the internal model of the world.
E99-1037.txt,78,In contrast to the dialogue knowledge base this model of the world cannot be altered by the learner because of its usage for inference and the absence of a consistency checking module to prevent contradictions etc. If the student has made an error_comma_ the system provides feedback to support the learner in typing a syntactically correct or semantically more plausible sentence.
E99-1037.txt,79,After this step the dialogue component tries to find a reaction to continue the dialogue_comma_ as described above.
E99-1037.txt,80,The main focus in all the analyses is to continue the dialogue but without ignoring the errors made by the learner.
E99-1037.txt,81,Only the orthographic check will actually interrupt the dialogue with a suggestion of correct words for the misspelled items.
E99-1037.txt,82,In all other cases the dialogue partner will react to the erroneous input depending on the type of error.
E99-1037.txt,83,4 Conclusion The aim of this concept is to provide a foreign language learner with exercises that enhance his her communicative ability.
E99-1037.txt,84,One important module in the system is the diMogue component itself which organizes e.g. the turntaking in a dialogue.
E99-1037.txt,85,At least two knowledge sources are necessary for limited flexibility and reusability.
E99-1037.txt,86,The structure of a dialogue can be handled by a discourse grammar whereas the content of a diMogue is stored into an expandable knowledge base.
E99-1037.txt,87,To add new dialogues_comma_ only the dialogue knowledge base and the surrounding discourse grammar have to be updated whereas the other specialized discourse grammars can be reused.
E99-1037.txt,88,The structure of the dialogue knowledge base could also allow for the handling of questions and multi sentence answers given by the learner.
E99-1037.txt,89,Nodes in the tree do not only represent variables to be instantiated by the learner_comma_ but might also include knowledge the system can provide to the learner.
E99-1037.txt,90,The kind of dialogue component presented here allows for 1 easy maintainance and expansion with new dialogues_comma_ 2 advanced feedback to the learner and 3 flexible and pedagogically sound exercises which enhance the process of aquiring communicative competence . .
E99-1028.txt,1,paper describes unsupervised learning algorithm for disambiguating verbal word senses using term weight learning. In our method_comma_ collocations which characterise every sense are extracted using similarity based estimation.
E99-1028.txt,2,For the results_comma_ term weight learning is performed.
E99-1028.txt,3,Parameters of term weighting are then estimated so as to maximise the collocations which characterise every sense and minimise the other collocations.
E99-1028.txt,4,The resuits of experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
E99-1028.txt,6,One of the major approaches to disambiguate word senses is supervised learning Gale et al._comma_ 1992 _comma_ Yarowsky_comma_ 1992 _comma_ Bruce and Janyce_comma_ 1994 _comma_ Miller et al._comma_ 1994 _comma_ Niwa and Nitta_comma_ 1994 _comma_ Luk_comma_ 1995 _comma_ Ng and Lee_comma_ 1996 _comma_ Wilks and Stevenson_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1028.txt,7,However_comma_ a major obstacle impedes the acquisition of lexical knowledge from corpora_comma_ i.e. the difficulties of manually sensetagging a training corpus_comma_ since this limits the applicability of many approaches to domains where this hard to acquire knowledge is already available.
E99-1028.txt,8,This paper describes unsupervised learning algorithm for disambiguating verbal word senses using term weight learning.
E99-1028.txt,9,In our approach_comma_ an overlapping clustering algorithm based on Mutual information based Mu term weight learning between a verb and a noun is applied to a set of verbs.
E99-1028.txt,10,It is preferable that Mu is not low Mu x_comma_y _ 3 for a reliable statistical analysis Church et al._comma_ 1991 .
E99-1028.txt,11,However_comma_ this suffers from the problem of data sparseness_comma_ i.e. the co occurrences which are used to represent every distinct senses does not appear in the test data.
E99-1028.txt,12,To attack this problem_comma_ for a low Mu value_comma_ we distinguish between unobserved co occurrences that are likely to occur in a new corpus and those that are not_comma_ by using similarity based estimation between two cooccurrences of words.
E99-1028.txt,13,For the results_comma_ term weight learning is performed.
E99-1028.txt,14,Parameters of term weighting are then estimated so as to maximise the collocations which characterise every sense and minimise the other collocations.
E99-1028.txt,15,In the following sections_comma_ we first define a polysemy from the viewpoint of clustering_comma_ then describe how to extract collocations using similaritybased estimation.
E99-1028.txt,16,Next_comma_ we present a clustering method and a method for verbal word sense disambiguation using the result of clustering.
E99-1028.txt,17,Finally_comma_ we report on an experiment in order to show the effect of the method.
E99-1028.txt,18,2 Polysemy in Context Most previous corpus based WSD algorithms are based on the fact that semantically similar words appear in a similar context.
E99-1028.txt,19,Semantically similar verbs_comma_ for example_comma_ co occur with the same nouns.
E99-1028.txt,20,The following sentences from the Wall Street Journal show polysemous usages of take. sl Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures. sl Guber and pepers tried to buy a stake in mgm in 1988.
E99-1028.txt,21,s2 That process of sorting out specifies is likely to take time.
E99-1028.txt,22,s2 We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations.
E99-1028.txt,23,Let us consider a two dimensional Euclidean space spanned by the two axes_comma_ each associated with stake and time_comma_ and in which take is assigned a vector whose value of the i th dimension is the value of Mu between the verb and the noun assigned to the i th axis.
E99-1028.txt,24,Take co occurs with the two nouns_comma_ while buy and spend co occur only with one of the two nouns.
E99-1028.txt,25,Therefore_comma_ the distances between take and these two verbs are large 209 Proceedings of EACL 99 and the synonymy of take with them disappears stake AL buy takel o take pend time Figure 1 The decomposition of the verb take In order to capture the synonymy of take with the two verbs correctly_comma_ one has to decompose the vector assigned to take into two component vectors_comma_ takel and take2_comma_ each of which corresponds to one of the two distinct usages of take in Figure 1 . we call them hypothetical verbs in the following .
E99-1028.txt,26,The decomposition of a vector into a set of its component vectors requires a proper decomposition of the context in which the word occurs.
E99-1028.txt,27,Furthermore_comma_ in a general situation_comma_ a polysemous verb co occurs with a large group of nouns and one has to divide the group of nouns into a set of subgroups_comma_ each of which correctly characterises the context for a specific sense of the polysemous word.
E99-1028.txt,28,Therefore_comma_ the algorithm has to be able to determine when the context of a word should be divided and how.
E99-1028.txt,29,The approach proposed in this paper explicitly introduces new entities_comma_ i.e. hypothetical verbs when an entity is judged polysemous and associates them with contexts which are sub contexts of the context of the original entity Our algorithm has two basic operations_comma_ splitting and lumping Splitting means to divide a polysemous verb into two hypothetical verbs and lumping means to combine two hypothetical verbs to make one verb out of them Fukumoto and Tsujii_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1028.txt,30,3 Extraction of Collocations Given a set of verbs_comma_ vl_comma_ v2_comma_ ._comma_ v_comma_ _comma_ the algorithm produces a set of semantic clusters_comma_ which are ordered in the ascending order of their semantic deviation values Semantic deviation is a measure of the deviation of the set in an n dimensional Euclidean space_comma_ where n is the number of nouns which co occur with the verbs In our algorithm_comma_ if vi is non polysemous_comma_ it belongs to at least one of the resultant semantic clusters.
E99-1028.txt,31,If it is polysemous_comma_ the algorithm splits it into several hypothetical verbs and each of them belongs to at least one of the clusters Table 1 summarises the sample result from the set close_comma_ open_comma_ end .

E99-1028.txt,33,Mu vi_comma_n is the value of mutual information between a verb and a noun.
E99-1028.txt,34,If a polysemous verb is followed by a noun which belongs to a set of the nouns_comma_ the meaning of the verb within the sentence can be determined accordingly_comma_ because a set of the nouns characterises one of the possible senses of the verb.
E99-1028.txt,35,The basic assumption of our approach is that a polysemous verb could not be recognised correctly if collocations which represent every distinct senses of a polysemous verb were not weighted correctly.
E99-1028.txt,36,In particular_comma_ for a low Mu value_comma_ we have to distinguish between those unobserved co occurrences that are likely to occur in a new corpus and those that are not.
E99-1028.txt,37,We extracted these collocations which represent every distinct senses of a polysemous verb using similarity based estimation.
E99-1028.txt,38,Let wv_comma_ nq and w i _comma_ nq be two different co occurrence pairs.
E99-1028.txt,39,We say that wv and nq are semantically related if w i and nq are semantically related and wp_comma_ nq and w i _comma_ nq are semantically similar Dagan et al._comma_ 1993 .
E99-1028.txt,40,Using the estimation_comma_ collocations are extracted and term weight learning is performed.
E99-1028.txt,41,Parameters of term weighting are then estimated so as to maximise the collocations which characterise every sense and minimise the other collocations.
E99-1028.txt,42,Let v be two senses_comma_ wp and wl_comma_ but not be judged correctly.
E99-1028.txt,43,Let N_Setl be a set of nouns which co occur with both v and wp_comma_ but do not cooccur with wl.
E99-1028.txt,44,Let also N.Set2 be a set of nouns which co occur with both v and wl_comma_ but do not co occur with wp_comma_ and N Set3 be a set of nouns which co occur with v_comma_ wp and wl.

E99-1028.txt,61,This algorithm requires a small number of training examples to serve as a seed.
E99-1028.txt,62,The result shows that the average percentage attained was 96.1 for 12 nouns when the training data was a 460 million word corpus_comma_ although Yarowsky uses only nouns and does not discuss distinguishing more than two senses of a word.
E99-1028.txt,63,A more recent unsupervised approach is described in Pedersen and Bruce_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1028.txt,64,They presented three unsupervised learning algorithms that distinguish the sense of an ambiguous word in untagged text_comma_ i.e.
E99-1028.txt,65,McQuitty s similarity analysis_comma_ Ward s minimum variance method and the EM algorithm.
E99-1028.txt,66,These algorithms assign each instance of an ambiguous word to a known sense definition based solely on the values of automatically identifiable features in text.
E99-1028.txt,67,Their methods are perhaps the most similar to our present work.
E99-1028.txt,68,They reported that disambiguating nouns is more successful rather than adjectives or verbs and the best result of verbs was McQuitty s method 71.8 _comma_ although they only tested 13 ambiguous words of these_comma_ there are only 4 verbs .
E99-1028.txt,69,Furthermore_comma_ each has at most three senses.
E99-1028.txt,70,In future_comma_ we will compare our method with their methods using the data we used in our experiment.
E99-1028.txt,71,8 Conclusion In this study_comma_ we proposed a method for disambiguating verbal word senses using term weight learning based on similarity based estimation.
E99-1028.txt,72,The results showed that when polysemous verbs have two_comma_ three and four senses_comma_ the average percentage attained at 80.0 _comma_ 77.7 and 76.4 _comma_ respectively.
E99-1028.txt,73,Our method assumes that nouns which co occur with a polysemous verb is disambiguated in advance.

E99-1038.txt,1,present an operable definition of focus which is argued to be of a cognito pragmatic nature and explore how it is determined in discourse in a formalized manner. For this purpose_comma_ a file card model of discourse model and knowledge store is introduced enabling the decomposition and formal representation of its determination process as a programmable algorithm FDA .
E99-1038.txt,2,Interdisciplinary evidence from social and cognitive psychology is cited and the prospect of the integration of focus via FDA as a discourse level construct into speech synthesis systems_comma_ in particular_comma_ concept tospeech systems_comma_ is also briefly discussed.
E99-1038.txt,4,The present paper aims to propose a working definition of focus and thereupon explore how focus is determined in discourse in doing so_comma_ it hopes to contribute to the potential integration of a focus module into speech synthesis systems_comma_ in particular_comma_ concept to speech ones.
E99-1038.txt,5,The motivation largely derives from the observation that focus_comma_ though recognized as the meeting point of linguistics and artificial intelligence Hajicova_comma_ 1987 carrying significant discourse information closely related to prosody generation_comma_ has nonetheless appeared evasive and intractable to formalization.
E99-1038.txt,6,Most current speech synthesis systems simply take focus as the point of departure in an a priori manner whilst few have looked into the issue of how focus occurs as it is_comma_ namely_comma_ how focus is determined by the speaker presumably in the discourse.
E99-1038.txt,7,We aim to redress this inadequacy by first defining focus as a cognitopragmatic category_comma_ which then enables a formal and procedural characterization of focus determination process in discourse_comma_ captured as focus determination algorithm FDA .

E99-1012.txt,1,propositions are analyzed in a type system where disambiguation is effected during assembly i.e. by coercion . Ambiguity is introduced through a layer of types that are underspecified relative to a pre existing collection of dependent types_comma_ construed as unambiguous propositions.
E99-1012.txt,2,A simple system of reasoning directly with such underspecification is described_comma_ and shown to be sound and complete for the full range of disambiguations.
E99-1012.txt,3,Beyond erasing types_comma_ the system supports constraints on disambiguations_comma_ including co variation.
E99-1012.txt,5,A widely held view expressed in Carbonell and Hayes_comma_ 1987 is that if there were one word to describe why natural language processing is hard_comma_ it is ambiguity.

E99-1012.txt,8,For the purposes of the present paper_comma_ what is interesting about a word_comma_ phrase_comma_ sentence or discourse that is ambiguous in isolation is how it may get disambiguated when combined with other expressions or_comma_ more generally_comma_ when placed in a wider context the challenge for any theory of ambiguity is to throw light on that process of disambiguation.

E99-1010.txt,1,statistical natural language processing we always face the problem of sparse data. One way to reduce this problem is to group words into equivalence classes which is a standard method in statistical language modeling.
E99-1010.txt,2,In this paper we describe a method to determine bilingual word classes suitable for statistical machine translation.
E99-1010.txt,3,We develop an optimization criterion based on a maximumlikelihood approach and describe a clustering algorithm.
E99-1010.txt,4,We will show that the usage of the bilingual word classes we get can improve statistical machine translation.
E99-1010.txt,6,Word classes are often used in language modelling to solve the problem of sparse data.
E99-1010.txt,7,Various clustering techniques have been proposed Brown et al._comma_ 1992 Jardino and Adda_comma_ 1993 Martin et al._comma_ 1998 which perform automatic word clustering optimizing a maximum likelihood criterion with iterative clustering algorithms.
E99-1010.txt,8,In the field of statistical machine translation we also face the problem of sparse data.
E99-1010.txt,9,Our aim is to use word classes in statistical machine translation to allow for more robust statistical translation models.
E99-1010.txt,10,A naive approach for doing this would be the use of mono lingually optimized word classes in source and target language.
E99-1010.txt,11,Unfortunately we can not expect these independently optimized classes to be correspondent.
E99-1010.txt,12,Therefore mono lingually optimized word classes do not seem to be useful for machine translation see also Fhng and Wu_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1010.txt,13,We define bilingual word clustering as the process of forming corresponding word classes suitable for machine translation purposes for a pair of languages using a parallel training corpus.
E99-1010.txt,14,The described method to determine bilingual word classes is an extension and improvement of the method mentioned in Och and Weber_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1010.txt,15,Our approach is simpler and computationally more efficient than Wang et al._comma_ 1996 .

E99-1010.txt,18,4 The function h n is a shortcut for n. log n .
E99-1010.txt,19,It is necessary to fix the number of classes in C in advance as the optimum is reached if every word is a class of its own.
E99-1010.txt,20,Because of this it is necessary to perform an additional optimization process which determines the number of classes.
E99-1010.txt,21,The use of leaving one out in a modified optimization criterion as in Kneser and Ney_comma_ 1993 could in principle solve this problem.
E99-1010.txt,22,An efficient optimization algorithm for LP1 is described in section 4.
E99-1010.txt,23,3 Bilingual Word Clustering In bilingual word clustering we are interested in classes and C which form partitions of the vocabulary of two languages.
E99-1010.txt,24,To perform bilingual word clustering we use a maximum likelihood approach as in the monolingnal case.
E99-1010.txt,26,The idea is to introduce the unknown alignment al J as hidden variable into a statistical model of the translation probability p fJle .
E99-1010.txt,27,By applying the EMalgorithm we obtain the model parameters.

E99-1010.txt,36,The quality of the resulting local optima can be improved if we accept a short term degradation of the optimization criterion during the optimization process.

E99-1010.txt,43,The key element of this approach are the alignment templates originally referred to as translation rules which are pairs of phrases together with an alignment between the words of the phrases.
E99-1010.txt,44,Examples of alignment templates are shown in Figure 2.
E99-1010.txt,45,The advantage of the alignment template approach against word based statistical translation models is that word context and local re orderings are explicitly taken into account.
E99-1010.txt,46,The alignment templates are automatically trained using a parallel training corpus.
E99-1010.txt,47,The translation of a sentence is done by a search process which determines the set of alignment templates which optimally cover the source sentence.
E99-1010.txt,48,The bilingual word classes are used to generalize the applicability of the alignment templates in search.
E99-1010.txt,49,If there exists a class which contains all cities in source and target language it is possible that an alignment template containing a special city can be generalized to all cities.

E99-1010.txt,64,For EUTRANS I we used 60 classes and for EUTRANS II we used 500 classes.
E99-1010.txt,65,We chose the number of classes in such a way that the final performance of the translation system was optimal.
E99-1010.txt,66,The CPU time for optimization of bilingual word classes on an Alpha workstation was under 20 seconds for EUTRANS I and less than two hours for EUTRANS II.

E99-1010.txt,75,For the small EuTRANS I task the word error rates reduce significantly.
E99-1010.txt,76,The word error rates for the EUTRANS II task are much larger because the task has a very large vocabulary and is more complex.
E99-1010.txt,77,The bilingual classes show better results than the monolingual classes MONO.
E99-1010.txt,78,One explanation for the improvement in translation quality is that the bilingually optimized classes result in an increased average size of used alignment templates.
E99-1010.txt,79,For example the average length of alignment templates with the EUTRANS I corpus using WORD is 2.85 and using BIL 2 it is 5.19.
E99-1010.txt,80,The longer the average alignment template length_comma_ the more context is used in the translation and therefore the translation quality is higher.
E99-1010.txt,81,An explanation for the superiority of BIL 2 over BIL is that by first optimizing the English classes mono lingually_comma_ it is much more probable that longer sequences of classes occur more often thereby increasing the average alignment template size.
E99-1010.txt,82,6 Summary and future works By applying a maximum likelihood approach to the joint probability of a parallel corpus we obtained an optimization criterion for bilingual word classes which is very similar to the one used in monolingual maximum likelihood word clustering.
E99-1010.txt,83,For optimization we used the exchange algorithm.
E99-1010.txt,84,The obtained word classes give a low translation lexicon perplexity and improve the quality of sta75 Proceedings of EACL 99 tistical machine translation.

E99-1025.txt,1,previous work_comma_ supertag disambiguation has been presented as a robust_comma_ partial parsing technique. In this paper we present two approaches contextual models_comma_ which exploit a variety of features in order to improve supertag performance_comma_ and class based models_comma_ which assign sets of supertags to words in order to substantially improve accuracy with only a slight increase in ambiguity.
E99-1025.txt,3,Many natural language applications are beginning to exploit some underlying structure of the language.
E99-1025.txt,4,Roukos 1996 and Jurafsky et al. 1995 use structure based language models in the context of speech applications.
E99-1025.txt,5,Grishman 1995 and Hobbs et al. 1995 use phrasal information in information extraction.
E99-1025.txt,6,Alshawi 1996 uses dependency information in a machine translation system.
E99-1025.txt,7,The need to impose structure leads to the need to have robust parsers.
E99-1025.txt,8,There have been two main robust parsing paradigms Finite State Grammar based approaches such as Abney 1990 _comma_ Grishman 1995 _comma_ and Hobbs et al. 1997 and Statistical Parsing such as Charniak 1996 _comma_ Magerman 1995 _comma_ and Collins 1996 .
E99-1025.txt,9,Srinivas 1997a has presented a different approach called supertagging that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques.
E99-1025.txt,10,The idea underlying the approach is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions Supertags that impose complex constraints in a local context.
E99-1025.txt,11,Supertag disambiguation is resolved Supported by NSF grants SBR 9710411 and GER 9354869 by using statistical distributions of supertag cooccurrences collected from a corpus of parses.
E99-1025.txt,12,It results in a representation that is effectively a parse almost parse .
E99-1025.txt,13,Supertagging has been found useful for a number of applications.
E99-1025.txt,14,For instance_comma_ it can be used to speed up conventional chart parsers because it reduces the ambiguity which a parser must face_comma_ as described in Srinivas 1997a .
E99-1025.txt,15,Chandrasekhar and Srinivas 1997 has shown that supertagging may be employed in information retrieval.
E99-1025.txt,16,Furthermore_comma_ given a sentence aligned parallel corpus of two languages and almost parse information for the sentences of one of the languages_comma_ one can rapidly develop a grammar for the other language using supertagging_comma_ as suggested by Bangalore 1998 .
E99-1025.txt,17,In contrast to the aforementioned work in supertag disambiguation_comma_ where the objective was to provide a direct comparison between trigram models for part of speech tagging and supertagging_comma_ in this paper our goal is to improve the performance of supertagging using local techniques which avoid full parsing.
E99-1025.txt,18,These supertag disambiguation models can be grouped into contextual models and class based models.
E99-1025.txt,19,Contextual models use different features in frameworks that exploit the information those features provide in order to achieve higher accuracies in supertagging.
E99-1025.txt,20,For class based models_comma_ supertags are first grouped into clusters and words are tagged with clusters of supertags.
E99-1025.txt,21,We develop several automated clustering techniques.
E99-1025.txt,22,We then demonstrate that with a slight increase in supertag ambiguity that supertagging accuracy can be substantially improved.
E99-1025.txt,23,The layout of the paper is as follows.
E99-1025.txt,24,In Section 2_comma_ we briefly review the task of supertagging and the results from previous work.
E99-1025.txt,25,In Section 3_comma_ we explore contextual models.
E99-1025.txt,26,In Section 4_comma_ we outline various class based approaches.
E99-1025.txt,27,Ideas for future work are presented in Section 5.
E99-1025.txt,28,Lastly_comma_ we 188 v Proceedings of EACL 99 present our conclusions in Section 6.
E99-1025.txt,29,2 Supertagging Supertags_comma_ the primary elements of the LTAG formalism_comma_ attempt to localize dependencies_comma_ including long distance dependencies.
E99-1025.txt,30,This is accomplished by grouping syntactically or semantically dependent elements to be within the same structure.
E99-1025.txt,31,Thus_comma_ as seen in Figure 1_comma_ supertags contain more information than standard part ofspeech tags_comma_ and there are many more supertags per word than part of speech tags.
E99-1025.txt,32,In fact_comma_ supertag disambiguation may be characterized as providing an almost parse_comma_ as shown in the bottom part of Figure 1.
E99-1025.txt,33,Local statistical information_comma_ in the form of a trigram model based on the distribution of supertags in an LTAG parsed corpus_comma_ can be used to choose the most appropriate supertag for any given word.
E99-1025.txt,34,Joshi and Srinivas 1994 define supertagging as the process of assigning the best supertag to each word.
E99-1025.txt,35,Srinivas 1997b and Srinivas 1997a have tested the performance of a trigram model_comma_ typically used for part of speech tagging on supertagging_comma_ on restricted domains such as ATIS and less restricted domains such as Wall Street Journal WSJ .
E99-1025.txt,36,In this work_comma_ we explore a variety of local techniques in order to improve the performance of supertagging.
E99-1025.txt,37,All of the models presented here perform smoothing using a Good Turing discounting technique with Katz s backoff model.
E99-1025.txt,38,With exceptions where noted_comma_ our models were trained on one million words of Wall Street Journal data and tested on 48K words.
E99-1025.txt,39,The data and evaluation procedure are similar to that used in Srinivas 1997b .
E99-1025.txt,40,The data was derived by mapping structural information from the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus into supertags from the XTAG grammar The XTAG Group 1995 using heuristics Srinivas 1997a .
E99-1025.txt,41,Using this data_comma_ the trigram model for supertagging achieves an accuracy of 91.37 _comma_ meaning that 91.37 of the words in the test corpus were assigned the correct supertag.1 3 Contextual Models As noted in Srinivas 1997b _comma_ a trigram model often fails to capture the cooccurrence dependencies 1The supertagging accuracy of 92.2 reported in Srinivas 1997b was based on a different supertag tagset specifically_comma_ the supertag corpus was reannotated with detailed supertags for punctuation and with a different analysis for subordinating conjunctions. between a head and its dependents dependents which might not appear within a trigram s window size.
E99-1025.txt,43,As described below_comma_ we show that the .
E99-1052.txt,1,article describes the current state of syntactic analysis of Estonian using Constraint Grammar. Constraint Grammar framework divides parsing into two different modules morphological disambiguation and determination of syntactic functions.
E99-1052.txt,2,This article focuses on the last module in detail.
E99-1052.txt,3,If the morphological disambiguator achieves the precision more than 85 and error rate is smaller than 2 then 80 88 of words becomes syntactically unambiguous.
E99-1052.txt,4,The error rate of parser is 1 4 depending on the ambiguity rate of input.
E99-1052.txt,5,The main goal of this work is to elaborate an efficient parser for Estonian and annotate the Corpus of Estonian Written Texts syntactically.
E99-1052.txt,6,It is the first attempt to write a parser for Estonian.
E99-1052.txt,8,The main idea of the Constraint Grammar Karlsson_comma_ 1990 is that it determines the surface level syntactic analysis of the text which has gone through prior morphological analysis.
E99-1052.txt,9,The process of syntactic analysis consists of three stages morphological disambiguation_comma_ identification of clause boundaries_comma_ and identification of syntactic functions of words.
E99-1052.txt,10,This article focuses on the last module in detail.
E99-1052.txt,11,Grammatical features of words are presented in the forms of tags which are attached to words.
E99-1052.txt,12,The tags indicate the inflectional and derivational properties of the word and the word class membership_comma_ the tags attached during the last stage of the analysis indicate its syntactic functions.
E99-1052.txt,13,The underlying principle in determining both the morphological interpretation and the syntactic functions is the same first all the possible labels are attached to words and then the ones that do not fit the context are removed by applying special rules or constraints.
E99-1052.txt,14,Constraint Grammar consists of hand written rules which by checking the context decide whether an interpretation is correct or has to be removed.
E99-1052.txt,15,Constraint Grammar seemed to suit best for the analysis of Estonian texts because its mechanism is simple and easily implementable_comma_ it can be well adapted for the Estonian language_comma_ it is at the same time sufficiently reliable robust and the resulting syntactic analysis that the Grammar gives suits various practical applications.
E99-1052.txt,16,2 Syntactic Analysis of Estonian The Estonian language is a Finno Ugric language and has got a rich structure of declensional and conjugational forms.
E99-1052.txt,17,The order of sentence constituents in Estonian is relatively free and influenced more by semantic and pragmatic factors.
E99-1052.txt,18,For morphological analysis of Estonian_comma_ we use the morphological analyser ESTMORF Kaalep_comma_ 1997 that assigns adequate morphological descriptions to about 98 of tokens in a text.
E99-1052.txt,19,Morphologically analysed text is disambiguated by Constraint Grammar disambiguator of Estonian.
E99-1052.txt,20,The development of disambiguator is in process but 85 90 of words become morphologically unambiguous and the error rate of this disambiguatot is less than 2 Puolakainen_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1052.txt,21,All the syntactic information is given by syntactic tags in constraint grammar framework.
E99-1052.txt,22,The syntactic tags of Estonian Constraint Grammar ESTCG are derived from tag set of English Constraint Grammar ENGCG Voutilainen et al._comma_ 1992 with some modifications considering the specialities of Estonian.
E99-1052.txt,23,These tags are attached to words by 175 morphosyntactic mapping rules.
E99-1052.txt,24,After this step of parsing there are approximately 3.8 tags per word.
E99-1052.txt,25,After the mapping operation syntactic constraints are applied.
E99-1052.txt,26,ESTCG contains 800 syntactic constraints.
E99-1052.txt,27,In fact_comma_ nearly half of them treat 291 Proceedings of EACL 99 the attributes.
E99-1052.txt,28,It can be explained by the fact that there are 12 types of attributes in ESTCG and the attribute tags are also added to almost every word in sentence except finite verbs and conjunctions .
E99-1052.txt,29,3 Results To evaluate the performance of parser I use two types of corpora.
E99-1052.txt,30,Training corpus is used for formulating rules and preliminary testing.
E99-1052.txt,31,After testing I improve rules so that most errors will be fixed next time.
E99-1052.txt,32,Benchmark corpus is used only for evaluating parser.
E99-1052.txt,33,Both types of corpora consist of fiction texts.
E99-1052.txt,34,The training corpus contains 4 texts of 2000 words from different Estonian writers.
E99-1052.txt,35,Benchmark corpus consists of 2000 word.
E99-1052.txt,36,I used these corpora in two experiments.
E99-1052.txt,37,In the first experiment experiment A I tested only the syntactic function detecting part of grammar and I supposed that the input text is ideally morphologically analysed and disambiguated_comma_ this means that all words are morphologically correct and unambiguous.
E99-1052.txt,38,For this experiment both corpora were manually morphologically disambiguated.
E99-1052.txt,39,In the second experiment experiment B I used the same corpora but they were disambiguated automatically.
E99-1052.txt,40,In this case the disambiguator made 2 errors and left 13 of words ambiguous_comma_ 1 of words were unknown for morphological analyser.
E99-1052.txt,41,The precision and recall of ESTCG parser are shown in table 1.
E99-1052.txt,43,Recall and precision.
E99-1052.txt,44,Corpus Recall Precision A Training 99_comma_12 83_comma_76 A Benchmark 98_comma_12 85_comma_00 B Training 95_comma_76 74_comma_34 B Benchmark 96_comma_58 76_comma_52 The big number of errors in B experiment can be explained by the fact that I wrote preliminary grammar rules using only manually disambiguated corpora and the work on correcting rules using more ambiguous input is still in process.
E99-1052.txt,45,As I mentioned before the input was ambiguous and erroneous in this experiment and this caused error rate of 3 .
E99-1052.txt,46,The errors in manually disambiguated corpora are mostly caused by ellipsis_comma_ some errors occurred during determination of apposition and the third biggest group of errors exists in sentences there one clause divides the other into two parts.
E99-1052.txt,47,In experiment A_comma_ 86 88 of words become syntactically unambiguous_comma_ and in experiment B_comma_ the .corresponding numbers are 80 82 .
E99-1052.txt,48,In both experiment less than 0_comma_5 of words have 5 6 syntactic tags.
E99-1052.txt,49,It is very difficult to distinguish adverbial attributes and adverbials.
E99-1052.txt,50,Approximately 6 of analysed words have both labels.
E99-1052.txt,51,This is almost the same problem as PP attachment in English but additionally it is possible to use both premodifying and postmodifying adverbial attributes in Estonian.
E99-1052.txt,52,Of course the PP attachment problem is also existent.
E99-1052.txt,53,The other hard problem is the distinction of genitive attributes and objects.
E99-1052.txt,54,If two or more nouns in genitive case are situated side by side then these words remain usually ambiguous_comma_ e.g .... siis vabastab kohus tema vara hooldaja j irelevalve alt. ... then free SG3 court NOM he GEN property GEN trustee GEN supervisionGEN from POSTP ... then the court frees his property from the supervision of trustee. 4 Conclusions In this paper I described my work on the syntactic part of Estonian Constraint Grammar parser.
E99-1052.txt,55,The error rate of parser is 1 4 depending on ambiguity rate of input.
E99-1052.txt,56,80 88 of words become syntactically unambiguous.
E99-1052.txt,57,The most exhaustive Constraint Grammar is written for English.
E99-1052.txt,58,Timo J rvinen_comma_ the author of syntactic part of ENGCG_comma_ reported that the error rate is 2 2_comma_5 and ambiguity rate ca 15 J rvinen_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1052.txt,59,Of course the Estonian and English are too different languages and the comparison of performance of parsers do not help to draw any fundamental conclusions.
E99-1052.txt,60,But I really hope that the Estonian parser achieves nearly the same performance very soon.
E99-1052.txt,61,The further work will focus on decreasing the error rate and using statistical analysis for generating new rules. .
E99-1034.txt,1,paper explores the issue of using different co occurrence similarities between terms for separating query terms that are useful for retrieval from those that are harmful. The hypothesis under examination is that useful terms tend to be more similar to each other than to other query terms.
E99-1034.txt,2,Preliminary experiments with similarities computed using first order and second order co occurrence seem to confirm the hypothesis.
E99-1034.txt,3,Term similarities could then be used for determining which query terms are useful and best reflect the user s information need.
E99-1034.txt,4,A possible application would be to use this source of evidence for tuning the weights of the query terms.
E99-1034.txt,6,Co occurrence information_comma_ whether it is used for expanding automatically the original query Qiu and Frei_comma_ 1993 _comma_ for providing a list of candidate terms to the user in interactive query expansion_comma_ or for relaxing the independence assumption between query terms van Rijsbergen_comma_ 1977 _comma_ has been widely used in information retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,7,Nevertheless_comma_ the use of this information has often resulted in reduction of retrieval effectiveness Smeaton and van Rijsbergen_comma_ 1983 _comma_ a fact sometimes explained by the poor discriminating power of the relationships Peat and Willet_comma_ 1991 .
E99-1034.txt,8,It was not until recently that a more elaborated use of this information resulted in consistent improvement of retrieval effectiveness.
E99-1034.txt,9,Improvements came from a different computation of the relationships named second order co occurrence Schutze and Pedersen_comma_ 1997 _comma_ from an adequate combination with other sources of evidence such as relevance feedback Xu and Croft_comma_ 1996 _comma_ or from a more careful use of the similarities for expanding the query Qiu and Frei_comma_ 1993 .
E99-1034.txt,10,Indeed_comma_ interesting patterns relying in cooccurrence information may be discovered and_comma_ if used carefully_comma_ may enhance retrieval effectiveness.
E99-1034.txt,11,This paper explores the use of co occurrence similarities between query terms for determining the subset of query terms which are good descriptors of the user s information need.
E99-1034.txt,12,Query terms can be divided into those that are useful for retrieval and those that are harmful_comma_ which will be named respectively content terms and noisy terms.
E99-1034.txt,13,The hypothesis under examination is that two content terms tend to be more similar to each other than would be two noisy terms_comma_ or a noisy and a content term.
E99-1034.txt,14,Intuitively_comma_ the query terms which reflect the user s information need are more likely to be found in relevant documents and should concern similar topic areas.
E99-1034.txt,15,Consequently_comma_ they should be found in similar contexts in the corpus.
E99-1034.txt,16,A similarity measures the degree to which two terms can be found in the same context_comma_ and should be higher for two content terms.
E99-1034.txt,17,We name this hypothesis the Cluster Hypothesis for query terms _comma_ due to its correspondence with the Cluster Hypothesis of information retrieval which assumes that relevant documents are more like one another than they are like nonrelevant documents van Rijsbergen and SparckJones_comma_ 1973_comma_ p.252 .
E99-1034.txt,18,Our middle term objective is to verify experimentally the hypothesis for different types of co occurrences_comma_ different measures of similarity and different collections.
E99-1034.txt,19,If a higher similarity between content terms is indeed observed_comma_ this pattern could be used for tuning the weights of query terms in the absence of relevance feedback information_comma_ by increasing the weights of the terms which appear to be content terms_comma_ and inversely for noisy terms.
E99-1034.txt,20,Next section is about the verification of the hypothesis on the CACM collection 3204 documents_comma_ 50 queries .
E99-1034.txt,21,241 Proceedings of EACL 99 2 Verifying the Cluster Hypothesis for query terms 2.1 The Cluster Hypothesis for query terms The hypothesis that similarities between query terms is an indicator of the relevance of each term to the user s information need is based on an intuition.
E99-1034.txt,22,This intuition can be illustrated by the following request Document will provide totals or specific data on changes to the proven reserve figures for any oil or natural gas producer.
E99-1034.txt,23,It appears that the only terms which appear in one or more relevant documents are oil_comma_reserve and gas_comma_ which obviously concern similar topic areas_comma_ and are good descriptors of the information need 1.
E99-1034.txt,24,All the other terms retrieve only nonrelevant documents_comma_ and consequently reduce retrieval effectiveness.
E99-1034.txt,25,Taken individually_comma_ they do not seem to specifically concern the user s information need.
E99-1034.txt,26,Our hypothesis can be formulated this way Content terms which are representative of the information need like oil_comma_ reserve_comma_ and gas concern similar topics and are more likely to be found in relevant documents Terms which concern similar topics should be found in similar contexts of the corpus documents_comma_ sentences_comma_ neighboring words...  Terms found in similar contexts have a high similarity value.
E99-1034.txt,27,Consequently_comma_ content terms tend to be similar to each other.
E99-1034.txt,28,2.2 Determining content terms and noisy terms Until now_comma_ we have talked of content or noisy terms_comma_ as terms which are useful or harmful for retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,29,How can we determine this
E99-1034.txt,30,First_comma_ terms which do not occur in any relevant document can only be harmful at best_comma_ they have no impact on retrieval and can directly be classified as noisy .
E99-1034.txt,31,For terms which occur in one or more relevant documents_comma_ the usefulness depends on the total number of relevant documents and on the number of occurrences of the term in the collection.
E99-1034.txt,32,We use the X2 test of independence between the occurrence of the term and the relevance of a document to determine if the term is a content or a 1 Remark that we do not consider here phrases such as natural gas _comma_ but the argument can be extended to phrases. noisy term.
E99-1034.txt,33,For terms which fail the test at the 95 confidence level_comma_ the hypothesis of independence is rejected_comma_ and they are considered content terms.
E99-1034.txt,34,Otherwise_comma_ they are considered noisy terms.
E99-1034.txt,35,Another way of verifying if a term is useful for retrieval would be to compare the retrieval efficiency of the query with and without the term.
E99-1034.txt,36,This method is appealing since our final objective is better retrieval efficiency.
E99-1034.txt,37,But it has some drawbacks 1 there are several measures of retrieval effectiveness_comma_ and 2 the classification of a term will depend in part on the retrieval system itselfi A point deserves discussion terms which do not appear in any relevant documents and which are classified noisy may sometimes be significant of the content of the query.
E99-1034.txt,38,This may happen for example if the number of relevant documents is small and if the vocabularies used in the request and in the relevant documents are different.
E99-1034.txt,39,Anyway_comma_ this does not change the fact that the term is harmful to retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,40,It could still be used for finding expansion terms_comma_ but this is another problem.
E99-1034.txt,41,In any case_comma_ a rough classification of terms between content and noisy can always be discussed_comma_ the same way that a binary classification of documents between relevant and non relevant is a major controversy in the field of information retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,42,2.3 Preliminary experiments Once terms are classified as either content or noisy_comma_ three types of term pairs are considered content content_comma_ content noisy_comma_ and noisy noisy.
E99-1034.txt,43,For each pair of query terms_comma_ different measures of similarity can be computed_comma_ depending on the type of co occurrence_comma_ the association measure_comma_ and so on.
E99-1034.txt,44,Each of the three classes of term pairs has an a priori probability to appear.
E99-1034.txt,45,We are interested in verifying if the similarity has an influence on this probability.
E99-1034.txt,46,One problem with first order co occurrence is that the majority of terms never co occur_comma_ because they occur too infrequently.
E99-1034.txt,47,We decided to select terms which occur more than ten times in the corpus.
E99-1034.txt,48,The same term pairs were used for first and second order co occurrence.
E99-1034.txt,49,Term pairs come from selected terms of the same query.
E99-1034.txt,50,For example_comma_ take a query with 10 terms of which 5 are classified content.
E99-1034.txt,51,Then for this query_comma_ there are I0. i0 I 2 45 term pairs_comma_ of which 5 5 1 2 10 are content content_comma_ 10 are noisy noisy_comma_ and the other 25 are noisy content.
E99-1034.txt,52,On the 50 queries used for experiments_comma_ there are 7544 term pairs_comma_ of which 1340 17.76 are 242 Proceedings of EACL 99 of class content content_comma_ 3426 45.41 of class content noisy_comma_ and 2778 36.82 of class noisynoisy.
E99-1034.txt,53,40.47 of the terms are content terms.
E99-1034.txt,54,Obviously_comma_ a term can be classified content in a query and noisy in another.
E99-1034.txt,55,In the following subsections_comma_ we present our preliminary experiments on the CACM collection.
E99-1034.txt,56,2.3.1 First order co occurrence First order co occurrence measures the degree to which two terms appear together in the same context.
E99-1034.txt,57,If the vectors of weights of ti and tj in documents d to dn are respectively wil_comma_ wi2_comma_..._comma_ w_comma_ T and wjz_comma_ wj2_comma_ ..._comma_ win T_comma_ the cosine similarity is n 2 x n 2 Wik V _comma_k l Wjk The weight wij was set to 1 if ti occured in dj_comma_ and to 0 otherwise_comma_ and within document frequency and document size were not exploited.
E99-1034.txt,58,Figure 1 shows the probability to find each of the classes vs similarity.
E99-1034.txt,59,The probabilities are computed from the raw data binned in intervals of similarity of 0.05_comma_ and for the 0 similarity value.
E99-1034.txt,61,There is a neat increase of probability of the class content content with increasing similarity.
E99-1034.txt,62,It is interesting to remark that if high values of similarities are evidence that the terms are content terms_comma_ small values can be taken as negative evidence for the same conclusion.
E99-1034.txt,63,By using smaller and more reliable contexts such as sentences_comma_ paragraphs or windows_comma_ it is expected that the measures of similarity should be more reliable_comma_ and the observed pattern should be stronger.
E99-1034.txt,64,2.3.2 Second Order co occurrence Second order co occurrence measures the degree to which two terms occur with similar terms.
E99-1034.txt,65,Terms are represented by vectors of cooccurrences where the dimensions correspond to each of the m terms in the collection.
E99-1034.txt,66,The value attributed to dimension k of term ti is the number of times that ti occurs with tk.
E99-1034.txt,67,More elaborated measures take into account a weight for each dimension_comma_ which represent the discriminating value of the corresponding term.
E99-1034.txt,68,Term ti is represented here by wil_comma_ wi2_comma_ ..._comma_ wire T_comma_ where wij is the number of time that ti and tj occur in the same context.
E99-1034.txt,69,0.8 0.7  content content  content noisy 0_comma_6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0_comma_2 0.1 0 0.05 0 .1 0. 5 0 2 0.15 013 SJr tar y Figure 1 Probability of term pairs classes vs First order similarity We used again Equation 1 for computing similarities between query terms.
E99-1034.txt,70,The similarity values were in general higher than for first order cooccurrence.
E99-1034.txt,71,Remark that the same data term pairs were taken for first and second order cooccurrence.
E99-1034.txt,73,Figure 2 represents the probabilities of the class vs similarity.
E99-1034.txt,74,Again_comma_ the probability of having the class content content increases with similarity_comma_ but to a lesser degree than with first order similarity.
E99-1034.txt,75,More experiments are needed to see if first order cooccurrence is in general stronger evidence of the quality of a term than second order co occurrence.
E99-1034.txt,76,However_comma_ a second order similarity can be computed for nearly all query terms_comma_ while first order similarities can only be computed for frequent enough terms.

E99-1034.txt,79,We have proposed a method to verify if the hypothesis holds in practice_comma_ and presented some preliminary investigations on the CACM collection which seem to confirm the hypothesis.
E99-1034.txt,80,But many other investigations have to be done on bigger collections_comma_ involving more elaborate measures of similarity using weights_comma_ different contexts paragraphs_comma_ sentences _comma_ and not only single words but also phrases.
E99-1034.txt,81,Experiments are ongoing on a subset of the TREC collection 200 Mb _comma_ and preliminary results seem to confirm the hypothesis.
E99-1034.txt,82,Our hope is that investigations on this large test collection should yield better results_comma_ since the computed similarities are statistically more reliable when they are computed on larger data sets.
E99-1034.txt,83,In a way_comma_ this work can be related to word sense disambiguation.
E99-1034.txt,84,This problem has already been addressed in the field of the information retrieval_comma_ but it has been shown that the impact of word sense disambiguation is of limited utility Krovetz and Croft_comma_ 1992 .
E99-1034.txt,85,Here the problem is not the determination of the correct sense of a word_comma_ but rather the determination of the usefulness of a query term for retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,86,However_comma_ it would be interesting to see if techniques developed for word sense disambiguation such as Yarowsky_comma_ 1992 could be adapted to determine the usefulness of a query term for retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,87,From our preliminary investigations_comma_ it seems that similarities can be used as positive and as negative evidence that a term should be useful for retrieval.
E99-1034.txt,88,The other part of our work is to determine a technique for using this pattern in order to improve term weighting_comma_ and at the end improve retrieval effectiveness.
E99-1034.txt,89,While simple techniques might work and will be tried e.g. clustering _comma_ we seriously doubt about it because every relationship between query terms should be taken into account_comma_ and this leads to very complex interactions.
E99-1034.txt,90,We are presently developing a model where the probability of the state content noisy of a term is determined by uncertain inference_comma_ using a technique for representing and handling uncertainty named Probabilistic Argumentation Systems Kohlas and Haenni_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1034.txt,91,In the next future_comma_ this model will be implemented and tested against simpler models.
E99-1034.txt,92,If the model allows to predict reasonably well the state of each query term_comma_ this information can be used to refine the weighting of query terms and lead to better information retrieval.

E99-1002.txt,1,simple formalism is proposed to represent the contexts in which pronouns_comma_ definite indefinite descriptions_comma_ and ordinal descriptions e.g. the second book can be used_comma_ and the way in which these expressions change the context. It is shown that referring expressions can be generated by a unification grammar provided that some phrase structure rules are specially tailored to express entities in the current knowledge base.
E99-1002.txt,3,Nominal referring expressions are exceptionally sensitive to linguistic context.
E99-1002.txt,4,If a discourse mentions a book_comma_ potential referring expressions include it _comma_ a book _comma_ the book _comma_ another book _comma_ the second book _comma_ along with an unlimited number of more complex descriptions e.g. the red book that mention the book s properties.
E99-1002.txt,5,The choice among these alternatives depends on features of the preceding text whether the referent has been mentioned before whether it is currently a focus of attention whether different referents of the same type e.g. other books have been introduced as well.
E99-1002.txt,6,Taking account of such factors poses a tricky problem for Natural Language Generation NLG _comma_ especially in applications in which efficiency i.e. fast generation of texts is a priority.
E99-1002.txt,7,This paper proposes a method that allows efficient generation of referring expressions_comma_ through a unification grammar_comma_ at the cost of some initial effort in tailoring the phrase structure rules to the current knowledge base.
E99-1002.txt,8,The method was invented to meet the needs of applications using WYSIWYM editing Power and Scott_comma_ 1998 _comma_ which allow an author to control the content of an automatically generated text without prior training in knowledge engineering.
E99-1008.txt,1,notion of mild context sensitivity was formulated in an attempt to express the formal power which is both necessary and sufficient to define the syntax of natural languages. However_comma_ some linguistic phenomena such as Chinese numbers and German word scrambling lie beyond the realm of mildly contextsensitive formalisms.
E99-1008.txt,2,On the other hand_comma_ the class of range concatenation grammars provides added power w.r.t_comma_ mildly context sensitive grammars while keeping a polynomial parse time behavior.
E99-1008.txt,3,In this report_comma_ we show that this increased power can be used to define the abovementioned linguistic phenomena with a polynomial parse time of a very low degree.
E99-1008.txt,7,However_comma_ there are some linguistic phenomena which are known to lie beyond MCS formalisms.
E99-1008.txt,11,In fact it may be considered to lie halfway between their respective string and integer versions RCGs retain from the string version of LMGs or LFPs the notion of concatenation_comma_ applying it to ranges couples of integers which denote occurrences of substrings in a source text rather than strings_comma_ and from their integer version the ability to handle only part of the source text this later feature being the key to tractability .
E99-1008.txt,12,RCGs can also be seen as definite clause grammars acting on a flat domain its variables are bound to ranges.
E99-1008.txt,13,This formalism_comma_ which extends CFGs_comma_ aims at being a convincing challenger as a syntactic base for various tasks_comma_ especially in natural language processing.
E99-1008.txt,14,We have shown that the positive version of RCGs_comma_ as simple LMGs or integer indexing LFPs_comma_ exactly covers the class PTIME of languages recognizable in deterministic polynomial time.
E99-1008.txt,15,Since the composition operations of RCGs are not restricted to be linear and non erasing_comma_ its languages RCLs are not semi linear.
E99-1008.txt,16,Therefore_comma_ RCGs are not MCS and are more powerful than LCFR systems_comma_ while staying computationally tractable its sentences can be parsed in polynomial time.
E99-1008.txt,17,However_comma_ this formalism shares with LCFR systems the fact that its derivations are CF i.e. the choice of the operation performed at each step only depends on the object to be derived from .
E99-1008.txt,18,As in the CF case_comma_ its derived trees can be packed into polynomial sized parse forests.
E99-1008.txt,19,For a CFG_comma_ the components of a parse forest are nodes labeled by couples A_comma_ p where A is a nonterminal symbol and p is a range_comma_ while for an RCG_comma_ the labels have the form A_comma_ p where is a vector list of ranges.
E99-1008.txt,20,Besides its power and efficiency_comma_ this formalism possesses many other attractive proper53 Proceedings of EACL 99 ties.

E99-1008.txt,22,The purpose of this paper is to study whether the extra power of RCGs Cover LCFR systems is sufficient to deal with Chinese numbers and German scrambling phenomena.
E99-1008.txt,25,Each occurrence of a predicate in the RHS of a clause is a predicate call_comma_ it is a predicate definition if it occurs in its LHS.
E99-1008.txt,26,Clauses which define predicate A are called A clauses.
E99-1008.txt,27,This definition assigns a fixed arity to each predicate name.
E99-1008.txt,28,The arity of S_comma_ the start predicate name_comma_ is one.
E99-1008.txt,29,The arity k of a grammar we have a k PRCG _comma_ is the maximum arity of its predicates.
E99-1008.txt,30,Lower case letters such as a_comma_ b_comma_ c_comma_... will denote terminal symbols_comma_ while late occurring upper case letters such as T_comma_ W_comma_ X_comma_ Y_comma_ Z will denote elements of V.
E99-1008.txt,31,The language defined by a PRCG is based on the notion of range.

E99-1008.txt,35,We will 1 Since this closure properties can be reached without changing the structure grammar of the constituents i.e. we can get the intersection of two grammars G1 and G2 without changing neither G1 nor G2 _comma_ this allows for a form of modularity which may lead to the design of libraries of reusable grammatical components. use several equivalent denotations for ranges an explicit dotted notation like wl w2 w3 or_comma_ if w2 extends from positions i 1 through j_comma_ a tuple notation i..j _comma_ or i..j when w is understood or of no importance.
E99-1008.txt,36,Of course_comma_ only consecutive ranges can be concatenated into new ranges.
E99-1008.txt,37,In any PRCG_comma_ terminals_comma_ variables and arguments in a clause are supposed to be bound to ranges by a substitution mechanism.
E99-1008.txt,38,An instantiated clause is a clause in which variables and arguments are consistently w.r.t. the concatenation operation replaced by ranges its components are instantiated predicates.
E99-1008.txt,40,In this case_comma_ the variables X_comma_ Y and Z are bound to g l..h _comma_ i l..j t and k..l 1 respectively.
E99-1008.txt,41,2 For a grammar G and a source text w_comma_ a derive relation_comma_ denoted by _comma_ is defined on strings of G_comma_w instantiated predicates.
E99-1008.txt,42,If an instantiated predicate is the LHS of some instantiated clause_comma_ it can be replaced by the RHS of that instantiated clause.

E99-1008.txt,45,Fundamentally_comma_ a predicate name A defines a notion property_comma_ structure_comma_ dependency_comma_... between its arguments_comma_ whose ranges can be arbitrarily scattered over the source text.
E99-1008.txt,46,PRCGs are therefore well suited to describe long distance dependencies.
E99-1008.txt,47,Overlapping ranges arise as a consequence of the non linearity of the formalism.
E99-1008.txt,48,For example_comma_ the same variable denoting the same range may occur in different arguments in the RHS of some clause_comma_ expressing different views properties of the same portion of the source text.
E99-1008.txt,49,2Often_comma_ for a variable X_comma_ instead of saying the range which is bound to X or denoted by X_comma_ we will say_comma_ the range X_comma_ or even instead of the string whose occurrence is denoted by the range which is bound to X_comma_ we will say the string X.
E99-1008.txt,50,54 Proceedings of EACL 99 Note that the order of RI IS predicates in a clause is of no importance.
E99-1008.txt,52,The degree of this polynomial is at most the maximum number of free independent bounds in a clause.
E99-1008.txt,53,Intuitively_comma_ if we consider an instantiation of a clause_comma_ all its terminal symbols_comma_ variable_comma_ arguments are bound to ranges.
E99-1008.txt,54,This means that each position bound in its arguments is mapped onto a source index_comma_ a position in the source text.
E99-1008.txt,55,However_comma_ at some times_comma_ the knowledge of a basic subset of couples bound_comma_ source index is sufficient to deduce the full mapping.
E99-1008.txt,56,4 We call number of free bounds_comma_ the minimum cardinality of such a basic subset.
E99-1008.txt,57,In the sequel we will assume that the predicate names len_comma_ and eq are defined s len l_comma_ X checks that the size of the range denoted by the variable X is the integer l_comma_ and eq X_comma_ Y checks that the substrings selected by the ranges X and Y are equal.
E99-1008.txt,58,3 Chinese Numbers RCGs The number name system of Chinese_comma_ specifically the Mandarin dialect_comma_ allows large number names to be constructed in the following way.
E99-1008.txt,59,The name for 1012 is zhao and the word for five is wu.
E99-1008.txt,60,The sequence uru zhao zhao wu zhao is a well formed Chinese number name i.e. 5 1024 5 1012 although wu zhao wu zhao zhao is not the number 4If XaY is some argument_comma_ if X aY denotes a position in this argument_comma_ and if XoaY_comma_ i is an element of the mapping_comma_ we know that Xa Y_comma_ i 1 must be another element.
E99-1008.txt,61,Moreover_comma_ if we know that the size of the range X is 3 and that the sizes of the ranges X and Y are always equal see for example the subsequent predicates len and eq _comma_ we can conclude that XaY_comma_ i 3 and XaY._comma_ i 4 are also elements of the mapping.
E99-1008.txt,62,SThe current implementation of our prototype system predefines several predicate names including len_comma_ and eq.
E99-1008.txt,63,It must be noted that these predefined predicates do not increase the formal power of RCGs since each of them can be defined by a pure RCG.
E99-1008.txt,64,For example_comma_ len 1_comma_X can be defined by lenl t  c which is a clause schema over all terminals t E T.
E99-1001.txt,1,is often claimed that Named Entity recognition systems need extensive gazetteers lists of names of people_comma_ organisations_comma_ locations_comma_ and other named entities. Indeed_comma_ the compilation of such gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a bottleneck in the design of Named Entity recognition systems.
E99-1001.txt,2,We report on a Named Entity recognition system which combines rule based grammars with statistical maximum entropy models.
E99-1001.txt,3,We report on the system s performance with gazetteers of different types and different sizes_comma_ using test material from the MUC 7 competition.
E99-1001.txt,4,We show that_comma_ for the text type and task of this competition_comma_ it is sufficient to use relatively small gazetteers of well known names_comma_ rather than large gazetteers of low frequency names.
E99-1001.txt,5,We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments.
E99-1001.txt,7,Named Entity recognition involves processing a text and identifying certain occurrences of words or expressions as belonging to particular categories of Named Entities NE .
E99-1001.txt,8,NE recognition software serves as an important preprocessing tool for tasks such as information extraction_comma_ information retrieval and other text processing applications.
E99-1001.txt,9,What counts as a Named Entity depends on the application that makes use of the annotations.
E99-1001.txt,10,One such application is document retrieval or automated document forwarding documents annoted with NE information can be searched more Now also at Harlequin Ltd.
E99-1001.txt,11,Edinburgh office accurately than raw text.
E99-1001.txt,12,For example_comma_ NE annotation allows you to search for all texts that mention the company Philip Morris _comma_ ignoring documents about a possibly unrelated person by the same name.
E99-1001.txt,13,Or you can have all documents forwarded to you about a person called Gates _comma_ without receiving documents about things called gates.
E99-1001.txt,14,In a document collection annotated with Named Entity information you can more easily find documents about Java the programming language without getting documents about Java the country or Java the coffee.
E99-1001.txt,15,Most common among marked categories are names of people_comma_ organisations and locations as well as temporal and numeric expression.
E99-1001.txt,16,Here is an example of a text marked up with Named Entity information ENAMEX TYPE PERSON Flavel Donne ENAMEX is an analyst with ENAMEX TYPE ORGANIZATION General Trends ENAMEX _comma_ which has been based in ENAMEX TYPE LOCATION Little Spring ENAMEX since TIMEX TYPE DATE July 1998 TIMEX .
E99-1001.txt,17,In an article on the Named Entity recognition competition part of MUC 6 Sundheim 1995 remarks that common organization names_comma_ first names of people and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup_comma_ although there are drawbacks Sundheim 1995 16 .
E99-1001.txt,18,In fact_comma_ participants in that competition from the University of Durham Morgan et al._comma_ 1995 and from SRA Krupka_comma_ 1995 report that gazetteers did not make that much of a difference to their system.
E99-1001.txt,19,Nevertheless_comma_ in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al. 1998 report that one of the bottlenecks in designing NE recognition systems is the limited availability of large gazetteers_comma_ particularly gazetteers for different languages Cucchiarelli et al. 1998 291 .
E99-1001.txt,20,People also use gazetteers of very different sizes.
E99-1001.txt,21,The basic gazetteers in the Isoquest system for MUC 7 contain 110_comma_000 names_comma_ but Krupka and Hausman 1998 show that system performance does not degrade much when the Proceedings of EACL 99 gazetteers are reduced to 25_comma_000 and 9_comma_000 names conversely_comma_ they also show that the addition of an extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves performance dramatically.
E99-1001.txt,22,This raises several questions how important are gazetteers is it important that they are big if gazetteers are important but their size isn t_comma_ then what are the criteria for building gazetteers
E99-1001.txt,23,One might think that Named Entity recognition could be done by using lists of e.g. names of people_comma_ places and organisations_comma_ but that is not the case.
E99-1001.txt,24,To begin with_comma_ the lists would be huge it is estimated that there are 1.5 million unique surnames just in the U.S.
E99-1001.txt,25,It is not feasible to list all possible surnames in the world in a Named Entity recognition system.
E99-1001.txt,26,There is a similar problem with company names.
E99-1001.txt,27,A list of all current companies worldwide would be huge_comma_ if at all available_comma_ and would immediately be out of date since new companies are formed all the time.
E99-1001.txt,28,In addition_comma_ company names can occur in variations a list of company names might contain The Royal Bank of Scotland plc _comma_ but that company might also be referred to as The Royal Bank of Scotland _comma_ The Royal or The Royal plc .
E99-1001.txt,29,These variations would all have to be listed as well.
E99-1001.txt,30,Even if it was possible to list all possible organisations and locations and people_comma_ there would still be the problem of overlaps between the lists.
E99-1001.txt,31,Names such as Emerson or Washington could be names of people as well as places Philip Morris could be a person or an organisation.
E99-1001.txt,32,In addition_comma_ such lists would also contain words like Hope and Lost locations and Thinking Machines and Next companies _comma_ whereas these words could also occur in contexts where they don t refer to named entities.
E99-1001.txt,33,Moreover_comma_ names of companies can be complex entities_comma_ consisting of several words.
E99-1001.txt,34,Especially where conjunctions are involved_comma_ this can create problems.
E99-1001.txt,35,In China International Trust and Investment Corp decided to do something _comma_ it s not obvious whether there is a reference here to one company or two.
E99-1001.txt,36,In the sentence Mason_comma_ Daily and Partners lost their court case it is clear that Mason_comma_ Daily and Partners is the name of a company.
E99-1001.txt,37,In the sentence Unfortunately_comma_ Daily and Partners lost their court case the name of the company does not include the word unfortunately _comma_ but it still includes the word Daily _comma_ which is just as common a word as unfortunately .
E99-1001.txt,38,In this paper we report on a Named Entity recognition system which was amongst the highest scoring in the recent MUC 7 Message Understanding Conference Competition MUC .

E99-1031.txt,1,paper describes an architecture for performing anaphora resolution in a flexible way. Systems which conform to these guidelines are wellencapsulated and portable_comma_ and can be used to compare anaphora resolution techniques for new language understanding applications.
E99-1031.txt,2,Our implementation of the architecture in a pronoun resolution testing platform demonstrates the flexibility of the approach.
E99-1031.txt,4,When building natural language understanding systems_comma_ choosing the best technique for anaphora resolution is a challenging task.
E99-1031.txt,5,The system builder must decide whether to adopt an existing technique or design a new approach.
E99-1031.txt,6,A huge variety of techniques are described in the literature_comma_ many of them achieving high success rates on their own evaluation texts cf. Hobbs 1986 Strube 1998 Mitkov 1998 .
E99-1031.txt,7,Each technique makes different assumptions about the data available to reference resolution_comma_ for example_comma_ some assume perfect parses_comma_ others assume only POS tagged input_comma_ some assume semantic information is available_comma_ etc. The chances are high that no published technique will exactly match the data available to a particular system s reference resolution component_comma_ so it may The authors thank James Allen for help on this project_comma_ as well as the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on the paper.

E99-1031.txt,9,229 not be apparent which method will work best.
E99-1031.txt,10,Choosing a technique is especially problematic for designers of dialogue systems trying to predict how anaphora resolution techniques developed for written monologue will perform when adapted for spoken dialogue.
E99-1031.txt,11,In an ideal world_comma_ the system designer would implement and compare many techniques on the input data available in his system.
E99-1031.txt,12,As a good software engineer_comma_ he would also ensure that any pronoun resolution code he implements can be ported to future applications or different language domains without modification.
E99-1031.txt,13,The architecture described in this paper was designed to provide just that functionality.
E99-1031.txt,14,Anaphora resolution code developed within the architecture is encapsulated to ensure portability across parsers_comma_ language genres and domains.
E99-1031.txt,15,Using these architectural guidelines_comma_ a testbed system for comparing pronoun resolution techniques has been developed at the University of Rochester.
E99-1031.txt,16,The testbed provides a highly configurable environment which uses the same pronoun resolution code regardless of the parser front end and language type under analysis.
E99-1031.txt,17,It can be used_comma_ inter alia_comma_ to compare anaphora resolution techniques for a given application_comma_ to compare new techniques to published baselines_comma_ or to compare a particular technique s performance across language types.

E99-1016.txt,1,paper presents a new approach to partial parsing of context free structures. The approach is based on Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,2,Each layer of the resulting structure is represented by its own Markov Model_comma_ and output of a lower layer is passed as input to the next higher layer.
E99-1016.txt,3,An empirical evaluation of the method yields very good results for NP PP chunking of German newspaper texts.
E99-1016.txt,5,Partial parsing_comma_ often referred to as chunking_comma_ is used as a pre processing step before deep analysis or as shallow processing for applications like information retrieval_comma_ messsage extraction and text summarization.
E99-1016.txt,6,Chunking concentrates on constructs that can be recognized with a high degree of certainty.
E99-1016.txt,7,For several applications_comma_ this type of information with high accuracy is more valuable than deep analysis with lower accuracy.
E99-1016.txt,8,We will present a new approach to partial parsing that uses Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,9,The presented models are extensions of the part of speech tagging technique and are capable of emitting structure.
E99-1016.txt,10,They utilize context free grammar rules and add left to right transitional context information.
E99-1016.txt,11,This type of model is used to facilitate the syntactic annotation of the NEGRA corpus of German newspaper texts Skut et al._comma_ 1997 .
E99-1016.txt,12,Part of speech tagging is the assignment of syntactic categories tags to words that occur in the processed text.
E99-1016.txt,13,Among others_comma_ this task is efficiently solved with Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,14,States of a Markov Model represent syntactic categories or tuples of syntactic categories _comma_ and outputs represent words and punctuation Church_comma_ 1988 DeRose_comma_ 1988_comma_ and others .
E99-1016.txt,15,This technique of statistical part of speech tagging operates very successfully_comma_ and usually accuracy rates between 96 and 97 are reported for new_comma_ unseen text.
E99-1016.txt,16,Brants et al. 1997 showed that the technique of statistical tagging can be shifted to the next level of syntactic processing and is capable of assigning grammatical functions.
E99-1016.txt,17,These are functions like subject_comma_ direct object_comma_ head_comma_ etc. They mark the function of a child node within its parent phrase.
E99-1016.txt,18,Figure 1 shows an example sentence and its structure.
E99-1016.txt,19,The terminal sequence is complemented by tags Stuttgart Tiibingen Tagset_comma_ Thielen and Schiller_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1016.txt,20,Non terminal nodes are labeled with phrase categories_comma_ edges are labeled with grammatical functions NEGRA tagset .
E99-1016.txt,21,In this paper_comma_ we will show that Markov Models are not restricted to the labeling task i.e._comma_ the assignment of part of speech labels_comma_ phrase labels_comma_ or labels for grammatical functions _comma_ but are also capable of generating structural elements.
E99-1016.txt,22,We will use cascades of Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,23,Starting with the part of speech layer_comma_ each layer of the resulting structure is represented by its own Markov Model.
E99-1016.txt,24,A lower layer passes its output as input to the next higher layer.
E99-1016.txt,25,The output of a layer can be ambiguous and it is complemented by a probability distribution for the alternatives.
E99-1016.txt,26,This type of parsing is inspired by finite state cascades which are presented by several authors.
E99-1016.txt,27,CASS Abney_comma_ 1991 Abney_comma_ 1996 is a partial parser that recognizes non recursive basic phrases chunks with finite state transducers.
E99-1016.txt,28,Each transducer emits a single best analysis a longest match that serves as input for the transducer at the next higher level.
E99-1016.txt,29,CASS needs a special grammar for which rules are manually coded.
E99-1016.txt,30,Each layer creates a particular subset of phrase types.
E99-1016.txt,31,FASTUS Appelt et al._comma_ 1993 is heavily based on pattern matching.
E99-1016.txt,32,Each pattern is associated with one or more trigger words.
E99-1016.txt,34,The structure consists of terminal nodes words and their parts of speech _comma_ non terminal nodes phrases and edges labeled with grammatical functions . as input to the next transducer.
E99-1016.txt,35,Roche_comma_ 1994 uses the fix point of a finite state transducer.
E99-1016.txt,36,The transducer is iteratively applied to its own output until it remains identical to the input.
E99-1016.txt,37,The method is successfully used for efficient processing with large grammars.
E99-1016.txt,38,Cardie and Pierce_comma_ 1998 present an approach to chunking based on a mixture of finite state and context free techniques.
E99-1016.txt,39,They use N P rules of a pruned treebank grammar.
E99-1016.txt,40,For processing_comma_ each point of a text is matched against the treebank rules and the longest match is chosen.
E99-1016.txt,41,Cascades of automata and transducers can also be found in speech processing_comma_ see e.g.
E99-1016.txt,42,Pereira et al._comma_ 1994 Mohri_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1016.txt,43,Contrary to finite state transducers_comma_ Cascaded Markov Models exploit probabilities when processing layers of a syntactic structure.
E99-1016.txt,44,They do not generate longest matches but most probable sequences.
E99-1016.txt,45,Furthermore_comma_ a higher layer sees different alternatives and their probabilities for the same span.
E99-1016.txt,46,It can choose a lower ranked alternative if it fits better into the context of the higher layer.
E99-1016.txt,47,An additional advantage is that Cascaded Markov Models do not need a stratified grammar i.e._comma_ each layer encodes a disjoint subset of phrases .
E99-1016.txt,48,Instead the system can be immediately trained on existing treebank data.
E99-1016.txt,49,The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
E99-1016.txt,50,Section 2 addresses the encoding of parsing processes as Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,51,Section 3 presents Cascaded Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,52,Section 4 reports on the evaluation of Cascaded Markov Models using treebank data.
E99-1016.txt,53,Finally_comma_ section 5 will give conclusions.
E99-1016.txt,54,2 Encoding of Syntactical Information as Markov Models When encoding a part of speech tagger as a Markov Model_comma_ states represent syntactic categories 1 and outputs represent words.
E99-1016.txt,55,Contextual probabilities of tags are encoded as transition probabilities of tags_comma_ and lexical probabilities of the Markov Model are encoded as output probabilities of words in states.
E99-1016.txt,56,We introduce a modification to this encoding.
E99-1016.txt,57,States additionally may represent non terminal categories phrases .
E99-1016.txt,58,These new states emit partial parse trees cf. figure 2 .
E99-1016.txt,59,This can be seen as collapsing a sequence of terminals into one nonterminal.
E99-1016.txt,60,Transitions into and out of the new states are performed in the same way as for words and parts of speech.
E99-1016.txt,61,Transitional probabilities for this new type of Markov Models can be estimated from annotated data in a way very similar to estimating probabilities for a part of speech tagger.
E99-1016.txt,62,The only difference is that sequences of terminals may be replaced by one non terminal.
E99-1016.txt,63,Lexical probabilities need a new estimation method.
E99-1016.txt,64,We use probabilities of context free partim parse trees.
E99-1016.txt,65,Thus_comma_ the lexical probability of the state NP in figure 2 is determined by P NP ART ADJA NN_comma_ ART ein_comma_ ADJA  enormer_comma_ NN Posten P NP ART ADJA NN P ART ein P ADJA  enormer P NN Posten Note that the last three probabilities are the same as for the part of speech model.

E99-1016.txt,71,Contrary to part of speech tagging_comma_ outputs of states may consist of structures with probabilities according to a stochastic context free grammar.
E99-1016.txt,72,3 Cascaded Markov Models The basic idea of Cascaded Markov Models is to construct the parse tree layer by layer_comma_ first structures of depth one_comma_ then structures of depth two_comma_ and so forth.
E99-1016.txt,73,For each layer_comma_ a Markov Model determines the best set of phrases.
E99-1016.txt,74,These phrases are used as input for the next layer_comma_ which adds one more layer.
E99-1016.txt,75,Phrase hypotheses at each layer are generated according to stochastic context free grammar rules the outputs of the Markov Model and subsequently filtered from left to right by Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,76,Figure 3 gives an overview of the parsing model.
E99-1016.txt,77,Starting with part of speech tagging_comma_ new phrases are created at higher layers and filtered by Markov Models operating from left to right.
E99-1016.txt,78,3.1 Tagging Lattices The processing example in figure 3 only shows the best hypothesis at each layer.
E99-1016.txt,79,But there are alternative phrase hypotheses and we need to determine the best one during the parsing process.
E99-1016.txt,80,All rules of the generated context free grammar with right sides that are compatible with part of the sequence are added to the search space.
E99-1016.txt,81,Figure 4 shows an example for hypotheses at the first layer when processing the sentence of figure 1.
E99-1016.txt,82,Each bar represents one hypothesis.
E99-1016.txt,83,The position of the bar indicates the covered words.
E99-1016.txt,84,It is labeled with the type of the hypothetical phrase_comma_ an index in the upper left corner for later reference_comma_ the negative logarithm of the probability that this phrase generates the terminal yield i.e._comma_ the smaller the better probabilities for part ofspeech tags are omitted for clarity .
E99-1016.txt,85,This part is very similar to chart entries of a chart parser.
E99-1016.txt,86,All phrases that are newly introduced at this layer are marked with an asterisk .
E99-1016.txt,87,They are produced according to context free rules_comma_ based on the elements passed from the next lower layer.
E99-1016.txt,88,The layer below layer 1 is the part of speech layer.
E99-1016.txt,89,The hypotheses form a lattice_comma_ with the word boundaries being states and the phrases being edges.
E99-1016.txt,90,Selecting the best hypothesis means to find the best path from node 0 to the last node node 14 in the example .
E99-1016.txt,91,The best path can be efficiently found with the Viterbi algorithm Viterbi_comma_ 1967 _comma_ which runs in time linear to the length of the word sequence.
E99-1016.txt,92,Having this view of finding the best hypothesis_comma_ processing of a layer is similar to word lattice processing in speech recognition cf. Samuelsson_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1016.txt,93,Two types of probabilities are important when searching for the best path in a lattice.
E99-1016.txt,94,First_comma_ these are probabilities of the hypotheses phrases generating the underlying terminal nodes words .
E99-1016.txt,95,They are calculated according to a stochastic context free grammar and given in figure 4.
E99-1016.txt,96,The second type are context probabilities_comma_ i.e._comma_ the probability that some type of phrase follows or precedes another.
E99-1016.txt,97,The two types of probabilities coincide with lexical and contextual probabilities of a Markov Model_comma_ respectively.
E99-1016.txt,98,According to a trigram model generated from a corpus _comma_ the path in figure 4 that is marked grey is the best path in the lattice.
E99-1016.txt,100,Start and end of the path are indicated by a dollar sign .
E99-1016.txt,101,This path is very close to the correct structure for layer 1.
E99-1016.txt,102,The CNP and PP are correctly recognized.
E99-1016.txt,103,Additionally_comma_ the best path correctly predicts that APPR_comma_ VAFIN and VVPP should not be attached in layer 1.
E99-1016.txt,104,The only error is the NP ein enormer Posten.
E99-1016.txt,105,Although this is on its own a perfect NP_comma_ it is not complete because the PP an Arbeit und Geld is missing.
E99-1016.txt,106,ART_comma_ ADJA and NN should be left unattached in this layer in order to be able to create the correct structure at higher layers.
E99-1016.txt,107,The presented Markov Models act as filters.
E99-1016.txt,108,The probability of a connected structure is determined only based on a stochastic context free grammar.
E99-1016.txt,109,The joint probabilities of unconnected partial structures are determined by additionally using Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,110,While building the structure bottom up_comma_ parses that are unlikely according to the Markov Models are pruned.
E99-1016.txt,111,3.2 The Method The standard Viterbi algorithm is modified in order to process Markov Models operating on lattices.
E99-1016.txt,112,In part of speech tagging_comma_ each hypothesis a tag spans exactly one word.
E99-1016.txt,113,Now_comma_ a hypothesis can span an arbitrary number of words_comma_ and the same span can be covered by an arbitrary number of alternative word or phrase hypotheses.
E99-1016.txt,114,Using terms of a Markov Model_comma_ a state is allowed to emit a context free partial parse tree_comma_ starting with the represented non terminal symbol_comma_ yielding part of the sequence of words.
E99-1016.txt,115,This is in contrast to standard Markov Models.
E99-1016.txt,116,There_comma_ states emit atomic symbols.
E99-1016.txt,117,Note that an edge in the lattice is represented by a state in the corresponding Markov Model.

E99-1020.txt,2,Tree Adjoining Grammars are a extension of CFG introduced by Joshi in Joshi_comma_ 1987 that use trees instead of productions as the primary representing structure.
E99-1020.txt,3,Several parsing algorithms have been proposed for this formalism_comma_ most of them based on tabular techniques_comma_ ranging from simple bottom up algorithms Vijay Shanker and Joshi_comma_ 1985 to sophisticated extensions of the Earley s algorithm Schabes and Joshi_comma_ 1988 Schabes_comma_ 1994 Nederhof_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1020.txt,4,However_comma_ it is difficult to inter relate different parsing algorithms.
E99-1020.txt,5,In this paper we study several tabular algorithms for TAG parsing_comma_ showing their common characteristics and how one algorithm can be derived from another in turn_comma_ creating a continuum from simple pure bottom up to complex predictive algorithms.
E99-1020.txt,6,Formally_comma_ a TAG is a 5 tuple  VN_comma_VT_comma_ S_comma_I_comma_A _comma_ where VN is a finite set of non terminal symbols_comma_ VT a finite set of terminal symbols_comma_ S the axiom of the grammar_comma_ I a finite set of initial trees and A a finite set of auxiliary trees.
E99-1020.txt,7,IUA is the set of elementary trees.
E99-1020.txt,8,Internal nodes are labeled by non terminals and leaf nodes by terminals or _comma_ except for just one leaf per auxiliary tree the foot which is labeled by the same non terminal used as the label of its root node.
E99-1020.txt,9,The path in an elementary tree from the root node to the foot node is called the spine of the tree.
E99-1020.txt,10,New trees are derived by adjoining let a be a tree contaiIiing a node N labeled by A and let be an auxiliary tree whose root and foot nodes are also labeled by A.
E99-1020.txt,11,Then_comma_ the adjoining of at the adjunction node N is obtained by excising the subtree of a with root N a_comma_ attaching j3 to N and attaching the excised subtree to the foot of .
E99-1020.txt,12,We use E adj N to denote that a tree may be adjoined at node N of the elementary tree a.
E99-1020.txt,13,In order to describe the parsing algorithms for TAG_comma_ we must be able to represent the partial recognition of elementary trees.
E99-1020.txt,14,Parsing algorithms for context free grammars usually denote partial recognition of productions by dotted productions.
E99-1020.txt,15,We can extend this approach to the case of TAG by considering each elementary tree q_comma_ as formed by a set of context free productions 7 7 a node N and its children N ... N are represented by a production N  N ... N .
E99-1020.txt,16,Thus_comma_ the position of the dot in the tree is indicated by the position of the dot in a production in 7 3 .
E99-1020.txt,17,The elements of the productions are the nodes of 150 Proceedings of EACL 99 the tree_comma_ except for the case of elements belonging to VT U E in the right hand side of production.
E99-1020.txt,18,Those elements may not have children and are not candidates to be adjunction nodes_comma_ so we identify such nodes labeled by a terminal with that terminal.
E99-1020.txt,19,To simplify the description of parsing algorithms we consider an additional production r R a for each initial tree and the two additional productions T  R and F  2_ for each auxiliary tree B_comma_ where R and F correspond to the root node and the foot node of 3_comma_ respectively.
E99-1020.txt,20,After disabling T and 2_ as adjunction nodes the generative capability of the grammars remains intact.

E99-1020.txt,28,An interesting application of this framework is the analysis of the relations between different parsing algorithms by studying the formal relations between their underlying parsing schemata.
E99-1020.txt,29,Originally_comma_ this framework was created for context free grammars but we have extended it to deal with tree adjoining grammars.

E99-1020.txt,33,A parsing schema is a parsing system parameterized by a grammar and a sentence.

E99-1030.txt,1,definition is one of the main bottlenecks in the development of new applications in the field of Information Extraction from text. Generic resources e.g._comma_ lexical databases are promising for reducing the cost of specific lexica definition_comma_ but they introduce lexical ambiguity.
E99-1030.txt,2,This paper proposes a methodology for building application specific lexica by using WordNet.
E99-1030.txt,3,Lexical ambiguity is kept under control by marking synsets in WordNet with field labels taken from the Dewey Decimal Classification.
E99-1030.txt,5,One of the current issues in Information Extraction IE is efficient transportability_comma_ as the cost of new applications is one of the factors limiting the market.
E99-1030.txt,6,The lexicon definition process is currently one of the main bottlenecks in producing applications.
E99-1030.txt,7,As a matter of fact the necessary lexicon for an average application is generally large hundreds to thousands of words and most lexical information is not transportable across domains.
E99-1030.txt,8,The problem of lexicon transport is worsened by the growing degree of lexicalization of IE systems nowadays several successful systems adopt lexical rules at many levels.
E99-1030.txt,9,The IE research mainstream focused essentially on the definition of lexica starting from a corpus sample Riloff_comma_ 1993 Grishman_comma_ 1997 with the implicit assumption that a corpus provided for an application is representative of the whole applica This work was carried on at ITC IRST as part of the author s dissertation for the degree in Philosophy University of Turin_comma_ supervisor Carla Bazzanella .
E99-1030.txt,10,The author wants to thank her supervisor at ITCIRST_comma_ Fabio Ciravegna_comma_ for his constant help.
E99-1030.txt,11,Alberto Lavelli provided valuable comments to the paper. tion requirement.
E99-1030.txt,12,Unfortunately one of the current trends in IE is the progressive reduction of the size of training corpora e.g._comma_ from the 1_comma_000 texts of the MUC 5 MUC 5_comma_ 1993 to the 100 texts in MUC 6 MUC 6_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1030.txt,13,When the corpus size is limited_comma_ the assumption of lexical representativeness of the sample corpus may not hold any longer_comma_ and the problem of producing a representative lexicon starting from the corpus lexicon arises Grishman_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1030.txt,14,Generic resources are interesting as they contain among others most of the terms necessary for an IE application.
E99-1030.txt,15,Nevertheless up to now the use of generic resources within IE system has been limited for two main reasons.
E99-1030.txt,16,First the information associated to each term is often not detailed enough for describing the relations necessary for a IE lexicon secondly the presence of a large amount of lexical polysemy.
E99-1030.txt,17,In this paper we propose a methodology for semi automatically developing the relevant part of a lexicon foreground lexicon for IE applications by using both a small corpus and WordNet.
E99-1030.txt,18,2 Developing IE Lexical Resources Lexical information in IE can be divided into three sources of information Kilgarriff_comma_ 1997  an ontology_comma_ i.e. the templates to be filled the foreground lexicon FL _comma_ i.e. the terms tightly bound to the ontology the background lexicon BL _comma_ i.e. the terms not related or loosely related to the ontology.
E99-1030.txt,19,In this paper we focus on FL only.
E99-1030.txt,20,The FL has generally a limited size with respect to the average dictionary of a language its dimension depends on each application needs_comma_ but it is generally limited to some hundreds of words.
E99-1030.txt,21,The level of quantitative and qualitative information for each entry in the FL can be very high and it is not transportable across domains and 225 Proceedings of EACL 99 applications_comma_ as it contains the mapping between the entries and the ontology.
E99-1030.txt,22,Generic dictionaries can contribute in identifying entries for the FL_comma_ but generally do not provide useful information for the mapping with the ontology.
E99-1030.txt,23,This mapping between words and ontology is generally to be built by hand.
E99-1030.txt,24,Most of the time in transporting the lexicon is spent in identifying and building FLs.
E99-1030.txt,25,Efficiently building FLs for applications means building the right FL or at least a reasonable approximation of it in a short time.
E99-1030.txt,26,The right FL contains those words that are necessary for the application and only those.
E99-1030.txt,27,The presence of all the relevant terms should guarantee that the information in the text is never lost inserting just the relevant terms allows to limit the development effort_comma_ and should guarantee the system from noise caused by spurious entries in the lexicon.
E99-1030.txt,28,The BL could be seen as the complementary set of the FL with respect to the generic language_comma_ i.e. it contains all the words of the language that do not belong to the FL.
E99-1030.txt,29,In general the quantity of application specific information is small.
E99-1030.txt,30,Any machine readable dictionary can be to some extent seen as a BL.
E99-1030.txt,31,The transport of BL to new applications is not a problem_comma_ therefore it will not be considered in this paper.
E99-1030.txt,32,2.1 Using Generic Lexical Resources We propose a development methodology for FLs based on two steps Bootstrapping manual or semi automatic identification from the corpus of an initial lexicon Core Lexicon _comma_ i.e. of the lexicon covering the corpus sample. Consolidation extension of the Core Lexicon by using a generic dictionary in order to completely cover the lexicon needed by the application but not exhaustively represented in the corpus sample.
E99-1030.txt,33,We propose to use WordNet Miller_comma_ 1990 as a generic dictionary during the consolidation phase because it can be profitably used for integrating the Core Lexicon by adding for each term in a semi automatic way its synonyms hyponyms and maybe hypernyms some coordinated terms.
E99-1030.txt,34,As mentioned_comma_ there are two problems related to the use of generic dictionaries with respect to the IE needs.
E99-1030.txt,35,First there is no clear way of extracting from them the mapping between the FL and the ontology this is mainly due to a lack of information and cannot in general be solved generic lexica cannot then be used during the bootstrapping phase to generate the Core Lexicon.
E99-1030.txt,36,Secondly experience showed that the lexical ambiguity carried by generic dictionaries does not allow their direct use in computational systems Basili and Pazienza_comma_ 1997 Morgan et al._comma_ 1995 .
E99-1030.txt,37,Even when they are used off line_comma_ lexical ambiguity can introduce so much noise and then overhead in the lexical development process that their use can be inconvenient from the point of view of efficiency and effectiveness.
E99-1030.txt,38,The next section explains how it is possible to cope with lexical ambiguity in WordNet by combining its information with another source of information the Dewey Decimal Classification DDC Dewey_comma_ 1989 .
E99-1030.txt,39,3 Reducing the lexical ambiguity in WordNet The main problem with the use of WordNet is lexical polysemy 1.
E99-1030.txt,40,Lexical polysemy is present when a word is associated to many senses synsets .
E99-1030.txt,41,In general it is not easy to discriminate between different synsets.
E99-1030.txt,42,It is then necessary to find a way for helping the lexicon developer in selecting the correct synset for a word.
E99-1030.txt,43,In order to cope with lexical polysemy_comma_ we propose to integrate WordNet synsets with an additional information a set of field labels.
E99-1030.txt,44,Field labels are indicators_comma_ generally used in dictionaries_comma_ which provide information about the use of the word in a semantic field.
E99-1030.txt,45,Semantic fields are sets of words tied together by similarity covering the most part of the lexical area of a specific domain.
E99-1030.txt,46,Marking synsets with field labels has a clear advantage in general_comma_ given a polysemous word in WordNet and a particular field label_comma_ in most of the cases the word is disambiguated.
E99-1030.txt,47,For example Security is polysemous as it belongs to 9 different synsets only the second one is related to the economic domain.
E99-1030.txt,48,If we mark this synset with the field label Economy_comma_ it is possible to disambiguate the term Security when analyzing texts in an economic context.
E99-1030.txt,49,Note that WordNet being a hierarchy_comma_ marking a synset with a field label means also marking all its sub hierarchy with such field label.
E99-1030.txt,50,In the Security example_comma_ if we mark the second synset with the field label Economy we also associate the same field label to the synonym Certificate_comma_ to the 13 direct hyponyms and to the 27 1 Actually the problem is related to both polysemy and omonymy.
E99-1030.txt,51,As WordNet does not distinguish between them_comma_ we will use the term polysemy for referring to both.
E99-1030.txt,52,226 Proceedings of EACL 99 Figure l An extract of the Dewey hierarchy relevant for the financial field indirect ones moreover we can also inspect its coordinated terms and assign the same label to 9 of the 33 coordinate terms and then to their direct and indirect hyponyms .
E99-1030.txt,53,Marking is equivalent to assigning WordNet synsets to sets each of them referring to a particular semantic field.
E99-1030.txt,54,Marking the structure allows us to solve the problem of choosing which synsets are relevant for the domain.
E99-1030.txt,55,Associating a domain e.g._comma_ finance to one or more field labels should allow us to determine in principle the synsets relevant for the domain.
E99-1030.txt,56,It is possible to greatly reduce the ambiguity implied by the use of WordNet by finding the correct set of field labels that cover all the WordNet hierarchy in an uniform way.
E99-1030.txt,57,Therefore we can reduce the overhead in building the FL using WordNet.
E99-1030.txt,58,Our assumption is that using semantic fields taken from the DDC 2 _comma_ all the possible domains can then be covered.
E99-1030.txt,59,This is because the first ten classes of the DDC an extract is shown in figure 1 exhaust the traditional academic disciplines and so they also cover the generic knowledge of the world.
E99-1030.txt,60,The integration consists in marking parts of WordNet s hierarchy_comma_ i.e. some synsets_comma_ with semantic labels taken from the DDC.
E99-1030.txt,61,4 The development cycle using WN PDDC The consolidation phase mentioned in section 2.1 can be integrated with the use of the WN DDC 2The Dewey Decimal Classification is the most widely used library classification system in the world at the broadest level_comma_ it classifies concepts into ten main classes_comma_ which cover the entire world of knowledge. as generic resource see figure 2 .
E99-1030.txt,62,Before starting the development_comma_ the set of field labels relevant for the application must be identified.
E99-1030.txt,63,Then the Core Lexicon is identified in the usual way.
E99-1030.txt,64,Using WN DDC it is possible for each term in the Core Lexicon to identify the synsets the term belongs to ambiguities are reduced by applying the intersection of the field labels chosen for the current application and those associated to the possible synsets. integrate the Core Lexicon by adding_comma_ for each term synonyms in the synsets_comma_ hyponyms and maybe hypernyms and some coordinated terms.
E99-1030.txt,65,The proposed methodology is corpus centered starting from the corpus analysis to build the Core Lexicon and can always be profitably applied.
E99-1030.txt,66,It also provides a criterion for building lexical resources for specific domains.
E99-1030.txt,67,It can be applied in a semiautomatic way.
E99-1030.txt,68,It has the advantage of using the information contained in WordNet for expanding the FL beyond the corpus limitations_comma_ keeping under control the ambiguity implied by the use of a generic resource.
E99-1030.txt,69,5 Conclusion Up to now experiments have been carried on in the financial domain_comma_ and in particular in the domain of bonds issued by banks.
E99-1030.txt,70,Experiments are continuing.
E99-1030.txt,71,The construction of WN DDC is a long process that has to be done in general.
E99-1030.txt,72,Up to now we have just started inserting in WordNet the field labels that are interesting for the domain 227 Proceedings of EACL 99 tunin tunin add J._ add hiponyms _comma__comma_ a WordNet DDC L I tares Figure 2 Outline of the final Consolidation phase. under analysis.
E99-1030.txt,73,If the final experiments will confirm the usefulness of the approach_comma_ we will extend the integration to the rest of the WordNet hierarchy.
E99-1030.txt,74,The final evaluation will include a comparison of the lexicon produced by using WN DDC with a normally developed lexicon in the domain of bond issue Ciravegna et el._comma_ 1999 .
E99-1030.txt,75,The evaluation will consider both quality and quantity of terms and development time of the whole lexicon.
E99-1030.txt,76,One of the issues that we are currently investigating is that of choosing the correct set of field labels from DDC DDC is very detailed and it is not worth integrating it completely with WordNet.
E99-1030.txt,77,It is necessary to individuate the correct set of labels by pruning the DDC hierarchy at some level.
E99-1030.txt,78,We are currently investigating the effectiveness of just selecting the first three levels of the hierarchy. .
E99-1006.txt,1,existing anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to account only for anaphors with NP antecedents. This paper describes an algorithm for the resolution of discourse deictic anaphors_comma_ which constitute a large percentage of anaphors in spoken dialogues.

E99-1007.txt,1,apply machine learning techniques to classify automatically a set of verbs into lexical semantic classes_comma_ based on distributional approximations of diatheses_comma_ extracted from a very large annotated corpus. Distributions of four grammatical features are sufficient to reduce error rate by 50 over chance.
E99-1007.txt,2,We conclude that corpus data is a usable repository of verb class information_comma_ and that corpus driven extraction of grammatical features is a promising methodology for automatic lexical acquisition.
E99-1007.txt,4,Recent years have witnessed a shift in grammar development methodology_comma_ from crafting large grammars_comma_ to annotation of corpora.
E99-1007.txt,5,Correspondingly_comma_ there has been a change from developing rule based parsers to developing statistical methods for inducing grammatical knowledge from annotated corpus data.
E99-1007.txt,6,The shift has mostly occurred because building wide coverage grammars is time consuming_comma_ error prone_comma_ and difficult.
E99-1007.txt,7,The same can be said for crafting the rich lexical representations that are a central component of linguistic knowledge_comma_ and research in automatic lexical acquisition has sought to address this Dorr and Jones_comma_ 1996 Dorr_comma_ 1997 _comma_ among others .
E99-1007.txt,8,Yet there have been few attempts to learn finegrained lexical classifications from the statistical analysis of distributional data_comma_ analogously to the induction of syntactic knowledge though see_comma_ e.g._comma_ Brent_comma_ 1993 Klavans and Chodorow_comma_ 1992 Resnik_comma_ 1992 .
E99-1007.txt,9,In this paper_comma_ we propose such an approach for the automatic classification of verbs into lexical semantic classes.
E99-1007.txt,10,1 We can express the issues raised by this approach as follows.
E99-1007.txt,12,Which linguistic distinctions among lexical classes can we expect to find in a corpus
E99-1007.txt,14,How easily can we extract the frequency distributions that approximate the relevant linguistic properties
E99-1007.txt,16,Which frequency distributions work best to distinguish the verb classes
E99-1007.txt,17,In exploring these questions_comma_ we focus on verb classification for several reasons.
E99-1007.txt,18,Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks_comma_ and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role in the organization and use of this knowledge Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation Dorr_comma_ 1997 _comma_ and document classification Klavans and Kan_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1007.txt,19,Manual classification of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task Levin_comma_ 1993 Miller et ah_comma_ 1990 Dang et ah_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1007.txt,20,To address these issues_comma_ we suggest that one can automatically classify verbs by using statistical approximations to verb diatheses_comma_ to train an automatic classifier.
E99-1007.txt,21,We use verb diatheses_comma_ following Levin and Dorr_comma_ for two reasons.
E99-1007.txt,22,First_comma_ verb diatheses are syntactic cues to semantic classes_comma_ We are aware that a distributional approach rests on one strong assumption on the nature of the representations under study semantic notions and syntactic notions are correlated_comma_ at least in part.
E99-1007.txt,23,This assumption is not uncontroversial Briscoe and Copestake_comma_ 1995 Levin_comma_ 1993 Dorr and Jones_comma_ 1996 Dorr_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1007.txt,24,We adopt it here as a working hypothesis without further discussion.
E99-1007.txt,25,45 Proceedings of EACL 99 hence they can be more easily captured by corpusbased techniques.
E99-1007.txt,26,Second_comma_ using verb diatheses reduces noise.
E99-1007.txt,27,There is a certain consensus Briscoe and Copestake_comma_ 1995 Pustejovsky_comma_ 1995 Palmer_comma_ 1999 that verb diatheses are regular sense extensions.
E99-1007.txt,28,Hence focussing on this type of classification allows one to .
E99-1024.txt,1,this paper_comma_ we propose a practical method to detect Japanese homophone errors in Japanese texts. It is very important to detect homophone errors in Japanese revision systems because Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors frequently.
E99-1024.txt,2,In order to detect homophone errors_comma_ we have only to solve the homophone problem.
E99-1024.txt,3,We can use the decision list to do it because the homophone problem is equivalent to the word sense disambiguation problem.
E99-1024.txt,4,However_comma_ the homophone problem is different from the word sense disambiguation problem because the former can use the written word but the latter cannot.
E99-1024.txt,5,In this paper_comma_ we incorporate the written word into the original decision list by obtaining the identifying strength of the written word.
E99-1024.txt,6,The improved decision list can raise the F measure of error detection.
E99-1024.txt,8,In this paper_comma_ we propose a method of detecting Japanese homophone errors in Japanese texts.
E99-1024.txt,9,Our method is based on a decision list proposed by Yarowsky Yarowsky_comma_ 1994 Yarowsky_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1024.txt,10,We improve the original decision list by using written words in the default evidence.
E99-1024.txt,11,The improved decision list can raise the F measure of error detection.
E99-1024.txt,12,Most Japanese texts are written using Japanese word processors.
E99-1024.txt,13,To input a word composed of kanji characters_comma_ we first input the phonetic hiragana sequence for the word_comma_ and then convert it to the desired kanji sequence.
E99-1024.txt,14,However_comma_ multiple converted kanji sequences are generally produced_comma_ and we must then choose the correct kanji sequence.
E99-1024.txt,15,Therefore_comma_ Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused by incorrect choices.
E99-1024.txt,16,Carelessness of choice alone is not the cause of homophone errors Ignorance of the difference among homophone words is serious.
E99-1024.txt,17,For example_comma_ many Japanese are not aware of the difference between . ._comma_ _comma_ and _comma_ _comma_ _comma_ or between . . and _comma_ _comma_t.
E99-1024.txt,18,In this paper_comma_ we define the term homophone set as a set of words consisting of kanji characters that have the same phone 2.
E99-1024.txt,19,Then_comma_ we define the term homophone word as a word in a homophone set.
E99-1024.txt,20,For example_comma_ the set   probability _comma_ 7 establishment is a homophone set because words in the set axe composed of kanji characters that have the same phone ka ku ri tu .
E99-1024.txt,21,Thus_comma_ q and f_ are homophone words.
E99-1024.txt,22,In this paper_comma_ we name the problem of choosing the correct word from the homophone set the homophone problem.
E99-1024.txt,23,In order to detect homophone errors_comma_ we make a list of homophone sets in advance_comma_ find a homophone word in the text_comma_ and then solve the homophone problem for the homophone word.
E99-1024.txt,24,Many methods of solving the homophone problem have been proposed Tochinai et al._comma_ 1986 Ibuki et al._comma_ 1997 Oku and Matsuoka_comma_ 1997 Oku_comma_ 1994 Wakita and Kaneko_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1024.txt,25,However_comma_ they are restricted to the homophone problem_comma_ that is_comma_ they are heuristic methods.
E99-1024.txt,26,On the other hand_comma_ the homophone problem is equivalent to the word sense disambiguation problem if the phone of the homophone word is regarded as the word_comma_ and the homophone word as the sense.
E99-1024.txt,27,Therefore_comma_ we can solve the homophone problem by using various 1 . ._comma_ . and . ..m _comma_ have a same phone i sift .
E99-1024.txt,28,The meaning of _comma_ is a general will_comma_ and the meaning of  . ._comma__comma_... is a strong positive will. . . and  have a same phone cho kkan .
E99-1024.txt,29,The meaning of l ff___comma_ .
E99-1024.txt,30,i is an intuition through a feeling_comma_ and the meaning of  is an intuition through a latent knowledge.
E99-1024.txt,31,ZWe ignore the difference of accents_comma_ stresses and parts of speech.
E99-1024.txt,32,That is_comma_ the homophone set is the set of words having the same expression in hiragana characters.
E99-1024.txt,33,180 Proceedings of EACL 99 statistical methods proposed for the word sense disambiguation problem Fujii_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1024.txt,34,Take the case of context sensitive spelling error detection 3_comma_ which is equivalent to the homophone problem.
E99-1024.txt,35,For that problem_comma_ some statistical methods have been applied and succeeded Golding_comma_ 1995 Golding and Schabes_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1024.txt,36,Hence_comma_ statistical methods axe certainly valid for the homophone problem.
E99-1024.txt,37,In particular_comma_ the decision list is valid for the homophone problem Shinnou_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1024.txt,38,The decision list arranges evidences to identify the word sense in the order of strength of identifying the sense.
E99-1024.txt,39,The word sense is judged by the evidence_comma_ with the highest identifying strength_comma_ in the context.
E99-1024.txt,40,Although the homophone problem is equivalent to the word sense disambiguation problem_comma_ the former has a distinct difference from the latter.
E99-1024.txt,41,In the homophone problem_comma_ almost all of the answers axe given correctly_comma_ because almost all of the expressions written in the given text are correct.
E99-1024.txt,42,It is difficult to decide which is the meaning of crane _comma_ crane of animal or crane of tool .
E99-1024.txt,43,However_comma_ it is almost right that the correct expression of  in a text is not  but 1 .
E99-1024.txt,44,In the homophone problem_comma_ the choice of the written word results in high precision.
E99-1024.txt,45,We should use this information.
E99-1024.txt,46,However_comma_ the method to always choose the written word is useless for error detection because it doesn t detect errors at all.
E99-1024.txt,47,The method used for the homophone problem should be evaluated from the precision and the recall of the error detection.
E99-1024.txt,48,In this paper_comma_ we evaluate it by the F measure to combine the precision and the recall_comma_ and use the written word to raise the F measure of the original decision list.
E99-1024.txt,49,We use the written word as an evidence of the decision list.
E99-1024.txt,50,The problem is how much strength to give to that evidence.
E99-1024.txt,51,If the strength is high_comma_ the precision rises but the recall drops.
E99-1024.txt,52,On the other hand_comma_ if the strength is low_comma_ the decision list is not improved.
E99-1024.txt,53,In this paper_comma_ we calculate the strength that gives the maximum F measure in a training corpus.
E99-1024.txt,54,As a result_comma_ our decision list can raise the F measure of error detection.
E99-1024.txt,55,2 Homophone disambiguation by a decision list In this section_comma_ we describe how to construct the decision list and to apply it to the homophone problem.
E99-1024.txt,56,SFor example_comma_ confusion between peace and piece _comma_ or between quiet and quite is the contextsensitive spelling error.
E99-1024.txt,57,2.1 Construction of the decision list The decision list is constructed by the following steps. step 1 Prepare homophone sets.
E99-1024.txt,58,In this paper_comma_ we use the 12 homophone sets shown in Table 1_comma_ which consist of homophone words that tend to be mis chosen.
E99-1013.txt,1,paper proposes a method to overcome the drawbacks of WordNet when applied to information retrieval by complementing it with Roget s thesaurus and corpus derived thesauri. Words and relations which are not included in WordNet can be found in the corpus derived thesauri.
E99-1013.txt,2,Effects of polysemy can be minimized with weighting method considering all query terms and all of the thesauri.
E99-1013.txt,3,Experimental results show that our method enhances information retrieval performance significantly.
E99-1013.txt,4,Department of Computer Science Tokyo Institute of Technology 2 12 1 Oookayama Meguro Ku Tokyo 152 8522 Japan rila_comma_take_comma_tanaka cs.titech.ac.jp expansion Voorhees_comma_ 1994 Smeaton and Berrut_comma_ 1995 _comma_ computing lexical cohesion Stairmand_comma_ 1997 _comma_ word sense disambiguation Voorhees_comma_ 1993 _comma_ and so on_comma_ but the results have not been very successful.
E99-1013.txt,5,Previously_comma_ we conducted query expansion experiments using WordNet Mandala et al._comma_ to appear 1999 and found limitations_comma_ which can be summarized as follows 1 .
E99-1013.txt,6,Information retrieval IR systems can be viewed basically as a form of comparison between documents and queries.
E99-1013.txt,7,In traditional IR methods_comma_ this comparison is done based on the use of common index terms in the document and the query Salton and McGill_comma_ 1983 .
E99-1013.txt,8,The drawback of such methods is that if semantically relevant documents do not contain the same terms as the query_comma_ then they will be judged irrelevant by the IR system.
E99-1013.txt,9,This occurs because the vocabulary that the user uses is often not the same as the one used in documents Blair and Maron_comma_ 1985 .
E99-1013.txt,10,To avoid the above problem_comma_ several researchers have suggested the addition of terms which have similar or related meaning to the query_comma_ increasing the chances of matching words in relevant documents.
E99-1013.txt,11,This method is called query expansion.
E99-1013.txt,12,A thesaurus contains information pertaining to paradigmatic semantic relations such as term synonymy_comma_ hypernymy_comma_ and hyponymy Aitchison and Gilchrist_comma_ 1987 .
E99-1013.txt,13,It is thus natural to use a thesaurus as a source for query expansion.
E99-1013.txt,14,Many researchers have used WordNet Miller_comma_ 1990 in information retrieval as a tool for query Interrelated words may have different parts of speech. Most domain specific relationships between words are not found in WordNet. Some kinds of words are not included in WordNet_comma_ such as proper names.
E99-1013.txt,15,To overcome all the above problems_comma_ we propose a method to enrich WordNet with Roget s Thesaurus and corpus based thesauri.
E99-1013.txt,16,The idea underlying this method is that the automatically constructed thesauri can counter all the above drawbacks of WordNet.
E99-1013.txt,17,For example_comma_ as we stated earlier_comma_ proper names and their interrelations are not found in WordNet_comma_ but if proper names bear some strong relationship with other terms_comma_ they often cooccur in documents_comma_ as can be modelled by a corpus based thesaurus.
E99-1013.txt,18,Polysemous words degrade the precision of information retrieval since all senses of the original query term are considered for expansion.
E99-1013.txt,19,To overcome the problem of polysemous words_comma_ we apply a restriction in that queries are expanded by adding those terms that are most similar to the entirety of the query_comma_ rather than selecting terms that are similar to a single term in the query.
E99-1013.txt,20,In the next section we describe the details of our method.
E99-1013.txt,21,94 Proceedings of EACL 99 2 Thesauri 2.1 WordNet In WordNet_comma_ words are organized into taxonomies where each node is a set of synonyms a synset representing a single sense.
E99-1013.txt,22,There are 4 different taxonomies based on distinct parts of speech and many relationships defined within each.
E99-1013.txt,23,In this paper we use only noun taxonomy with hyponymy hypernymy or is a relations_comma_ which relates more general and more specific senses Miller_comma_ 1988 .
E99-1013.txt,24,Figure 1 shows a fragment of the WordNet taxonomy.
E99-1013.txt,26,2.2 Roget s Thesaurus In Roget s Thesaurus Chapman_comma_ 1977 _comma_ words are classified according to the ideas they express_comma_ and these categories of ideas are numbered in sequence.
E99-1013.txt,27,The terms within a category are further organized by part of speech nouns_comma_ verbs_comma_ adjectives_comma_ adverbs_comma_ prepositions_comma_ conjunctions_comma_ and interjections .
E99-1013.txt,28,Figure 2 shows a fragment of Roget s category.
E99-1013.txt,29,In this case_comma_ our similarity measure treat all the words in Roger as features.
E99-1013.txt,30,A word w possesses the feature f if f and w belong to the same Roget category.
E99-1013.txt,31,The similarity between two words is then defined as the Dice coefficient of the two feature vectors Lin_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1013.txt,32,sim wl_comma_w2 21R wl n R w l tn w_comma_ l In w l where R w is the set of words that belong to the same Roget category as w.
E99-1013.txt,33,2.3 Corpus based Thesaurus 2.3.1 Co occurrence based Thesaurus This method is based on the assumption that a pair of words that frequently occur together in the same document are related to the same subject.
E99-1013.txt,34,Therefore word co occurrence information can be used to identify semantic relationships between words Schutze and Pederson_comma_ 1997 Schutze and Pederson_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1013.txt,35,We use mutual information as a tool for computing similarity between words.
E99-1013.txt,36,Mutual information compares the probability of the co occurence of words a and b with the independent probabilities of occurrence of a and b Church and Hanks_comma_ 1990 .
E99-1013.txt,37,P a_comma_ b I a_comma_ b log P a P b where the probabilities of P a and P b are estimated by counting the number of occurrences of a and b in documents and normalizing over the size of vocabulary in the documents.
E99-1013.txt,38,The joint probability is estimated by counting the number of times that word a co occurs with b and is also normalized over the size of the vocabulary.
E99-1013.txt,39,2.3.2 Syntactically based Thesaurus In contrast to the previous section_comma_ this method attempts to gather term relations on the basis of linguistic relations and not document cooccurrence statistics.
E99-1013.txt,40,Words appearing in similax grammatical contexts are assumed to be similar_comma_ and therefore classified into the same class Lin_comma_ 1998 Grefenstette_comma_ 1994 Grefenstette_comma_ 1992 Ruge_comma_ 1992 Hindle_comma_ 1990 .
E99-1013.txt,41,First_comma_ all the documents are parsed using the Apple Pie Parser.
E99-1013.txt,42,The Apple Pie Parser is a natural language syntactic analyzer developed by Satoshi Sekine at New York University Sekine and Grishman_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1013.txt,43,The parser is a bottom up probabilistic chart parser which finds the parse tree with the best score by way of the best first search algorithm.
E99-1013.txt,44,Its grammar is a semi context sensitive grammar with two non terminals and was automatically extracted from Penn Tree Bank syntactically tagged corpus developed at the University of Pennsylvania.
E99-1013.txt,45,The parser generates a syntactic tree in the manner of a Penn Tree Bank bracketing.
E99-1013.txt,46,Figure 3 shows a parse tree produced by this parser.
E99-1013.txt,47,The main technique used by the parser is the best first search.
E99-1013.txt,48,Because the grammar is probabilistic_comma_ it is enough to find only one parse tree with highest possibility.
E99-1013.txt,49,During the parsing process_comma_ the parser keeps the unexpanded active nodes in a heap_comma_ and always expands the active node with the best probability.
E99-1013.txt,50,Unknown words are treated in a special manner.
E99-1013.txt,51,If the tagging phase of the parser finds an unknown word_comma_ it uses a list of parts of speech defined in the parameter file.
E99-1013.txt,52,This information has been collected from the Wall Street Journal corpus and uses part of the corpus for training and the rest for testing.
E99-1013.txt,53,Also_comma_ it has separate lists for such information as special suffices like ly_comma_ y_comma_ ed_comma_d_comma_ and s.
E99-1013.txt,54,The accuracy of this parser is reported 95 Proceedings of EACL 99 Synonyms Hypernyms Ordered by Frequency of noun correlation 2 senses of correlation Sense 1 correlation_comma_ correlativity reciprocality_comma_ reciprocity relation .
E99-1042.txt,1,of the claimed benefits of Tree Adjoining Grammars is that they have an extended domain of locality EDOL . We consider how this can be exploited to limit the need for feature structure unification during parsing.
E99-1042.txt,2,We compare two wide coverage lexicalized grammars of English_comma_ LEXSYS and XTAG_comma_ finding that the two grammars exploit EDOL in different ways.
E99-1042.txt,4,One of the most basic properties of Tree Adjoining Grammars TAGS is that they have an extended domain of locality EDOL Joshi_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1042.txt,5,This refers to the fact that the elementary trees that make up the grammar are larger than the corresponding units the productions that are used in phrase structure rule based frameworks.
E99-1042.txt,6,The claim is that in Lexicalized TAGS LTAGS the elementary trees provide a domain of locality large enough to state co occurrence relationships between a lexical item the anchor of the elementary tree and the nodes it imposes constraints on.
E99-1042.txt,7,We will call this the extended domain of locality hypothesis.
E99-1042.txt,8,For example_comma_ wh movement can be expressed locally in a tree that will be anchored by a verb of which an argument is extracted.
E99-1042.txt,9,Consequently_comma_ features which are shared by the extraction site and the wh word_comma_ such as case_comma_ do not need to be percolated_comma_ but are directly identified in the tree.
E99-1042.txt,10,Figure 1 shows a tree in which the case feature at the extraction site and the wh word share the same value3 1The anchor substitution and foot nodes of trees are marked with the symbols o_comma_ and._comma_ respectively.
E99-1042.txt,11,Words in parenthesis are included in trees to provide examples of strings this tree can derive.
E99-1042.txt,12,Much of the research on TAGS tail be seen as illustrating how its EDOL can be exploited in various ways.
E99-1042.txt,13,However_comma_ to date_comma_ only indirect evidence has been given regarding the beneficial effects of the EDOL on parsing efficiency.
E99-1042.txt,14,The argument_comma_ due to Schabes 1990 _comma_ is that benefits to parsing arise from lexicalization_comma_ and that lexicalization is only possible because of the EDOL.
E99-1042.txt,15,A parser dealing with a lexicalized grammar needs to consider only those elementary structures that can be associated with the lexical items appearing in the input.
E99-1042.txt,16,This can substantially reduce the effective grammar size at parse time.
E99-1042.txt,17,The argument that an EDOL is required for lexicalization is based on the observation that not every set of trees that can be generated by a CFG can be generated by a lexicalized CFG.
E99-1042.txt,18,But does the EDOL have any other more direct effects on parsing efficiency
E99-1042.txt,19,On the one hand_comma_ it is a consequence of the EDOL that wide coverage LTAGS are larger than their rule based counterparts.
E99-1042.txt,20,With larger elementary structures_comma_ generalizations are lost regarding the internal structure of the elementary trees.
E99-1042.txt,21,Since parse time depends on grammar size_comma_ this could have an adverse effect on parsing efficiency.
E99-1042.txt,22,However_comma_ the problem of grammar size in TAG has to some extent been addressed both with respect to grammar encoding Evans et al._comma_ 1995 Candito_comma_ 1996 and parsing Joshi and Srinivas_comma_ 1994 Evans and Weir_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1042.txt,23,On the other hand_comma_ if the EDOL hypothesis holds for those dependencies that are being checked by the parser_comma_ then the burden of passing feature values around during parsing will be less than in a rule based framework.
E99-1042.txt,24,If all dependencies that the parser is checking can be stated directly within the elementary structures of the grammar_comma_ they do not need to be comPuted dynamically during the parsing process by means of feature percolation.
E99-1042.txt,25,For example_comma_ there is no need to use a slash feature to establish filler gap dependencies over unbounded distances across the tree if the EDOL 269 Proceedings of EACL 99 Thus_comma_ passive sentences such as The scheme was singled out by a recent Government report are found difficult 3_comma_ despite the presence of the syntactic cues was_comma_ ed and by.
E99-1042.txt,26,We therefore replace passive constructions with corresponding active forms.
E99-1042.txt,27,We are currently integrating further rules to split conjoined sentences and extract embedded clauses.
E99-1042.txt,28,Syntactic simplification operates iteratively until a configuration is reached that cannot be simplified.
E99-1042.txt,29,This approach is broadly similar to that proposed by Chandrasekar et al._comma_ 1996 .
E99-1042.txt,30,One of the many challenges in syntactic simplification is the observed effect of the total length of a text being increased when longer sentences are replaced by multiple shorter ones.
E99-1042.txt,31,Also_comma_ the removal of cohesive devices such as conjunctions may result in anaphora crossing sentence boundaries.
E99-1042.txt,32,To maintain text coherence and cohesion Grodzinsky et al._comma_ 1993 an anaphor is replaced by its referent if the containing sentence is split.
E99-1042.txt,33,Lexical Simplifier The lexical simplifier based on Devhn_comma_ 1999 Devlin and Tait_comma_ 1998 replaces content words with simpler synonyms.
E99-1042.txt,34,It first retrieves a set of synonyms for each word from WordNet Miller et al._comma_ 1993 _comma_ then_comma_ according to the user s desired level of simplification_comma_ the original word plus a percentage of the synonym list are looked up in the Oxford Psycholinguistic Database Quinlan_comma_ 1992 for the corresponding Kucera Francis frequencies.
E99-1042.txt,35,The word with the highest frequency is selected.
E99-1042.txt,36,Morphological Generator Simplification works on the inflectionally analysed text_comma_ so the last stage is morphological generation.
E99-1042.txt,37,The generator is simply an inverted version of the morphological analyser described above.
E99-1042.txt,38,The inversion is performed automatically Minnen and Carroll_comma_ Submitted _comma_ so any improvements made to the analyser are reflected in the generator at no extra cost.
E99-1042.txt,39,Finally_comma_ inter word spelling changes e.g. a apple  an apple _comma_ auxiliary reduction_comma_ etc. are performed.
E99-1042.txt,40,3 Evaluation We will perform an experimental evaluation of the system with the help of aphasic participants who are matched to the extent that none display visually related reading difficulties_comma_ which would confound the results_comma_ and all possess a sufficiently high reading ability determined at the time of the experiment by using an aphasia assessment battery.
E99-1042.txt,41,As the system is a general tool aimed at 3Semantically reversible sentences such as The boy was kissed by the girl are even more difficult_comma_ since either noun phrase could be the subject. all aphasics_comma_ the participants will not be screened for aphasia type.
E99-1042.txt,42,The readability of the simplified text and the usability of the system will be assessed by observation and interview questions will be posed to gauge subjects comprehension of both explicit and implicit material. .
E99-1023.txt,1,sentences in chunks of words is a useful preprocessing step for parsing_comma_ information extraction and information retrieval. l mshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 have introduced a convenient data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task. In this paper we will examine seven different data representations for the problem of recognizing noun phrase chunks.
E99-1023.txt,2,We will show that the the data representation choice has a minor influence on chunking performance.
E99-1023.txt,3,However_comma_ equipped with the most suitable data representation_comma_ our memory based learning chunker was able to improve the best published chunking results for a standard data set.
E99-1023.txt,5,The text corpus tasks parsing_comma_ information extraction and information retrieval can benefit from dividing sentences in chunks of words.
E99-1023.txt,6,Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 describe an error driven transformation based learning TBL method for finding NP chunks in texts.
E99-1023.txt,7,NP chunks or baseNPs are non overlapping_comma_ non recursive noun phrases.
E99-1023.txt,8,In their experiments they have modeled chunk recognition as a tagging task words that are inside a baseNP were marked I_comma_ words outside a baseNP received an 0 tag and a special tag B was used for the first word inside a baseNP immediately following another baseNP.
E99-1023.txt,10,An example is the representation used in Ratnaparkhi_comma_ 1998 where all the chunkinitial words receive the same start tag analogous to the B tag while the remainder of the words in the chunk are paired with a different tag.
E99-1023.txt,11,This removes tagging ambiguities.
E99-1023.txt,12,In the Ratnaparkhi representation equal noun phrases receive the same tag sequence regardless of the context in which they appear.
E99-1023.txt,13,The data representation choice might influence the performance of chunking systems.
E99-1023.txt,14,In this paper we discuss how large this influence is.
E99-1023.txt,15,Therefore we will compare seven different data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task.
E99-1023.txt,16,We are particularly interested in finding out whether with one of the representation formats the best reported results for this task can be improved.
E99-1023.txt,17,The second section of this paper presents the general setup of the experiments.
E99-1023.txt,18,The results Can be found in the third section.
E99-1023.txt,19,In the fourth section we will describe some related work.
E99-1023.txt,20,2 Methods and experiments In this section we present and explain the data representation formats and the machine learning algorithm that we have used.
E99-1023.txt,21,In the final part we describe the feature representation used in our experiments.
E99-1023.txt,22,2.1 Data representation We have compared four complete and three partial data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task presented in Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1023.txt,23,The four complete formats all use an I tag for words that are inside a baseNP and an 0 tag for words that are outside a baseNP.
E99-1023.txt,26,All baseNP initial words receive a B tag Ratnaparkhi_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1023.txt,27,The final word inside a baseNP immediately preceding another baseNP receives an E tag.
E99-1023.txt,28,All baseNP final words receive an E tag.
E99-1023.txt,29,We wanted to compare these data representation tbrmats with a standard bracket representation.
E99-1023.txt,30,We have chosen to divide bracketing experiments in two parts one for recognizing opening brackets and one for recognizing closing brackets.
E99-1023.txt,31,Additionally we have worked with another partial representation which seemed promising a tagging representation which disregards boundaries between adjacent chunks.
E99-1023.txt,32,These boundaries can be recovered by combining this format with one of the bracketing formats.
E99-1023.txt,34,IO Words inside a baseNP receive an I tag_comma_ others receive an O tag.
E99-1023.txt,37,The result is interpreted as the IOE2 format.
E99-1023.txt,38,Examples of the four complete formats and the three partial formats can be found in table 1.
E99-1023.txt,39,2.2 Memory Based Learning We have build a baseNP recognizer by training a machine learning algorithm with correct tagged data and testing it with unseen data.
E99-1023.txt,40,The machine learning algorithm we used was a MemoryBased Learning algorithm MBL .
E99-1023.txt,41,During training it stores a symbolic feature representation of a word in the training data together with its classification chunk tag .
E99-1023.txt,42,In the testing phase the algorithm compares a feature representation of a test word with every training data item and chooses the classification of the training item which is closest to the test item.
E99-1023.txt,43,In the version of the algorithm that we have used_comma_ IBI IG_comma_ the distances between feature representations are computed as the weighted sum of distances between individual features Daeleroans et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1023.txt,44,Equal features are defined to have distance 0_comma_ while the distance between other pairs is some feature dependent value.
E99-1023.txt,46,Details of the algorithm can be found in Daelemans et al._comma_ 1998 I.
E99-1023.txt,47,2.3 Representing words with features An important decision in an MBL experiment is the choice of the features that will be used for representing the data.
E99-1023.txt,48,IBI IG is thought to be less sensitive to redundant features because of the data dependent feature weighting that is included in the algorithm.
E99-1023.txt,49,We have found that the presence of redundant features has a negative influence on the performance of the baseNP recognizer.
E99-1023.txt,50,In Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 a set of transformational rules is used for modifying the classification of words.
E99-1023.txt,51,The rules use context information of the words_comma_ the part of speech tags that have been assigned to them and the chunk tags that are associated with them.
E99-1023.txt,52,We will use the same information as in our feature representation for words.
E99-1023.txt,53,In TBL_comma_ rules with different context information are used successively for solving different problems.
E99-1023.txt,54,We will use the same context information for all data.
E99-1023.txt,55,The optimal context size will be determined by comparing the results of different context sizes on the training data.
E99-1023.txt,56,Here we will perform four steps.
E99-1023.txt,57,We will start with testing diffhrent context sizes of words with their part ofspeech tag.
E99-1023.txt,58,After this_comma_ we will use the classification results of the best context size for determining the optimal context size for the classification tags.
E99-1023.txt,59,As a third step_comma_ we will evaluate combinations of classification results and find the best combination.
E99-1023.txt,60,Finally we will examine the influence of an MBL algorithm parameter the number of examined nearest neighbors. lr l l is a part of the TiMBL software package which is available from http ilk.kub.nl 3 Results We have used the baseNP data presented in Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 2.
E99-1023.txt,61,This data was divided in two parts.
E99-1023.txt,62,The first part was training data and consisted of 211727 words taken from sections 15_comma_ 16_comma_ 17 and 18 from the Wall Street Journal corpus WSJ .
E99-1023.txt,63,The second part was test data and consisted of 47377 words taken from section 20 of the same corpus.
E99-1023.txt,64,The words were part of speech POS tagged with the Brill tagger and each word was classified as being inside or outside a baseNP with the IOB1 representation scheme.
E99-1023.txt,65,The chunking classification was made by Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 based on the parsing information in the WSJ corpus.
E99-1023.txt,66,The performance of the baseNP recognizer can be measured in different ways by computing the percentage of correct classification tags accuracy _comma_ the percentage of recognized baseNPs that are correct precision and the percentage of baseNPs inthe corpus that are found recall .
E99-1023.txt,67,We will follow Argamon et al._comma_ 1998 and use a combination of the precision and recall rates F I 2 precision recall  precision recall .
E99-1023.txt,68,In our first experiment series we have tried to discover the best word part of speech tag context for each representation format.
E99-1023.txt,69,For computational reasons we have limited ourselves to working with section 15 of the WSJ corpus.
E99-1023.txt,70,This section contains 50442 words.
E99-1023.txt,71,We have run 5 fold crossvalidation experiments with all combinations of left and right contexts of word POS tag pairs in the size range 0 to 4.
E99-1023.txt,72,A summary of the results can be found in table 2.
E99-1023.txt,73,The baseNP recognizer performed best with relatively small word POS tag pair contexts.
E99-1023.txt,74,Different representation formats required different context sizes for optimal performance.
E99-1023.txt,77,The three combinations of partial representations systematically outperformed the four complete representations.
E99-1023.txt,78,This is probably caused by the fact that they are able to use two different context sizes for solving two different parts of the recognition problem.
E99-1023.txt,79,In a second series of experiments we used a cascaded classifier.
E99-1023.txt,80,This classifier has two stages cascades .
E99-1023.txt,81,The first cascade is similar to the classifter described in the first experiment.
E99-1023.txt,82,For the second cascade we added the classifications of the first cascade as extra features.
E99-1023.txt,83,The extra features consisted of the left and the right context of the classification tags.
E99-1023.txt,84,The focus chunk tag the classification of the current word accounts for the correct classification in about 95 of the cases.
E99-1023.txt,85,The MBL algorithm assigns a large weight to this input feature and this makes it harder for the other features to contribute to a good result.
E99-1023.txt,86,To avoid this we have refrained from using this tag.
E99-1023.txt,87,Our goal was to find out the optimal number of extra classification tags in the input.
E99-1023.txt,88,We performed 5 fold cross validation experiments with all combinations of left_comma_ and right classification tag contexts in the range 0 tags to 3 tags.
E99-1023.txt,89,A summary of the results can be found in table 33 .
E99-1023.txt,90,We achieved higher F I for all representations except for the bracket pair representation.
E99-1023.txt,91,The third experiment series was similar to the second but instead of adding output of one experiment we added classification results of three_comma_ four or five experiments of the first series.
E99-1023.txt,92,By doing this we supplied the learning algorithm with information about different context sizes.
E99-1023.txt,93,This information is available to TBL in the rules which use different contexts.
E99-1023.txt,94,We have limited ourselves to examining all successive combinations of three_comma_ four and five experiments of the lists L O R O_comma_ 1 1_comma_ 2 2_comma_ 3 3_comma_ 4 4 _comma_ 0 1_comma_ 1 2_comma_ 2 3_comma_ 3 4 and 1 0_comma_ 2 1_comma_ 3 2_comma_ 4 3 .
E99-1023.txt,95,A summary of the results can be found in table 4.
E99-1023.txt,96,The results for four representation formats improved.
E99-1023.txt,97,In the fourth experiment series we have experimented with a different value for the number of nearest neighbors examined by the IBI IG algorithm parameter k .
E99-1023.txt,98,This algorithm standardly uses the single training item closest to the test 3In a number of cases a different base configuration in one experiment series outperformed the best base configuration found in the previous series.
E99-1023.txt,99,In the second series L R I 2 outperformed 2 2 for IOE2 when chunk tags were added and in the third series chunk tag context 1 1 outperformed 1 2 for IOB1 when different combinations were tested.
E99-1023.txt,101,IOB1 is the best representation format but the differences with the results of the other formats are not significant. item.
E99-1023.txt,102,However Daelemans et al._comma_ 1999 report that for baseNP recognition better results can be obtained by making the algorithm consider the classification values of the three closest training items.
E99-1023.txt,103,We have tested this by repeating the first experiment series and part of the third experiment series for k 3.
E99-1023.txt,104,In this revised version we have repeated the best experiment of the third series with the results for k l replaced by the k 3 results whenever the latter outperformed the first in the revised first experiment series.
E99-1023.txt,105,The results can be found in table 5.
E99-1023.txt,106,All formats benefited from this step.
E99-1023.txt,107,In this final experiment series the best results were obtained with IOB1 but the differences with the results of the other formats are not significant.
E99-1023.txt,108,We have used the optimal experiment configurations that we had obtained from the fourth experiment series for processing the complete Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 data set.
E99-1023.txt,109,The results can be found in table 6.
E99-1023.txt,110,They are better than the results for section 15 because more training data was used in these experiments.
E99-1023.txt,111,Again the best result was obtained with IOB1 F I 92.37 which is an imI rovement of the best reported F_comma_ 1 rate for this data set Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 92.03 .
E99-1023.txt,112,We would like to apply our learning approach to the large data set mentioned in Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 Wall Street Journal corpus sections 2 21 as training material and section 0 as test material.
E99-1023.txt,113,With our present hardware applying our optimal experiment configuration to this data would require several months of computer time.
E99-1023.txt,114,Therefore we have only used the best stage 1 approach with IOB1 tags a left and right cont _comma_.xt of three words and three POS tags combined with k 3. This time the chunker achieved a F l score of 93.81 which is half a point better than the results obtained by Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 93.3 other chunker rates for this data accuracy 98.04 precision 93.71 recalh 93.90 .
E99-1023.txt,115,4 Related work The concept of chunking was introduced by Abney in Abney_comma_ 1991 .
E99-1023.txt,116,He suggested to develop a chunking parser which uses a two part syntactic analysis creating word chunks partial trees and attaching the chunks to create complete syntactic trees.
E99-1023.txt,117,Abney obtained support for such a chunking stage from psycholinguistic literature.
E99-1023.txt,118,Ramshaw and Marcus used transformationbased learning TBL for developing two chunkers Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1023.txt,119,One was trained to recognize baseNPs and the other was trained to recognize both NP chunks and VP chunks.
E99-1023.txt,120,Ramshaw and Marcus approached the chunking task as a tagging problem.
E99-1023.txt,121,Their baseNP training and test data from the Wall Street Journal corpus are still being used as benchmark data for current chunking experiments.
E99-1023.txt,122,Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 shows that baseNP recognition Fz I 92.0 is easier than finding both NP and VP chunks Fz 1 88.1 and that increasing the size of the training data increases the performance on the test set.
E99-1023.txt,123,The work by Ramshaw and Marcus has inspired three other groups to build chunking algorithms.
E99-1023.txt,124,Argamon et al._comma_ 1998 introduce Memory Based Sequence Learning and use it for different chunking experiments.
E99-1023.txt,125,Their algorithm stores sequences of POS tags with chunk brackets and uses this information for recognizing chunks in unseen data.
E99-1023.txt,126,It performed slightly worse on baseNP recognition than the Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 experiments Fz 1 91.6 .
E99-1023.txt,127,Cardie and Pierce_comma_ 1998 uses a related method but they only store POS tag sequences forming complete baseNPs.
E99-1023.txt,128,These sequences were applied to unseen tagged data aIter which post processing repair rules were used for fixing some frequent errors.
E99-1023.txt,129,This approach performs worse than othe.r reported approaches Fo I 90.9 .
E99-1023.txt,131,The data was processed with the optimal input feature combinations found in the fourth experiment series.
E99-1023.txt,132,The accuracy rate contains the fraction of chunk tags that was correct.
E99-1023.txt,133,The other three rates regard baseNP recognition.
E99-1023.txt,134,The bottom part of the table shows some other reported results with this data set.
E99-1023.txt,135,With all but two formats IBI IG achieves better FZ l rates than the best published result in Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1023.txt,136,Veenstra_comma_ 1998 uses cascaded decision tree learning IGTree for baseNP recognition.
E99-1023.txt,137,This algorithm stores context information of words_comma_ POS tags and chunking tags in a decision tree and classifies new items by comparing them to the training items.
E99-1023.txt,138,The algorithm is very fast and it reaches the same performance as Argamon et al._comma_ 1998 F_comma_ 1 91.6 .
E99-1023.txt,139,Daelemans et al._comma_ 1999 uses cascaded MBL IBI IG in a similar way for several tasks among which baseNP recognition.
E99-1023.txt,140,They do not report F rates but their tag accuracy rates are a lot better than accuracy rates reported by others.
E99-1023.txt,141,However_comma_ they use the Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 data set in a different training test division 10 fold cross validation which makes it tifficult to compare their results with others. 5 Concluding remarks We hay . omI ared seven tiffi rent tata. formats for the recognition of baseNPs with memory based learning IBI IG .
E99-1023.txt,142,The IOB1 format_comma_ introduced in Ramshaw and Marcus_comma_ 1995 _comma_ consistently ame out as the best format. However_comma_ the differences with other formats were not significant. Some representation formats achieved better pre ision rates_comma_ others better recall rates. This information is usefifl ibr tasks that require chunking structures because some tasks might be more interested in high precision rates while others might be more interested in high recall rates. The IBI IG algorithm has been able to improve the best reported F2 1 rates for a stan lar l data set 92.37 versus Ramshaw and Mar us_comma_ 1995 s 92.03 .
E99-1023.txt,143,This result was aided by using non standard parameter values k 3 and the algorithm was sensitive for redundant input features.
E99-1023.txt,144,This means that finding an optimal performance or this task requires searching a large parameter feature configuration space.
E99-1023.txt,145,An interesting topic for future research would be to embed ml IG in a standard search algorithm_comma_ like hillclimbing_comma_ and explore this parameter space.
E99-1023.txt,146,Some more room for improved performance lies in computing the POS tags in the data with a better tagger than presently used. .
E99-1051.txt,1,this work_comma_ we present an experimental analysis of a Dialogue System for the automatization of simple telephone services. Starting from the evaluation of a preliminar version of the system we 1 conclude the necessity to desing a robust and flexible system suitable to have to have different dialogue control strategies depending on the characteristics of the user and the performance of the speech recognition module.
E99-1051.txt,2,Experimental results following the PARADISE framework show an important improvement both in terms of task success and dialogue cost for the proposed system.
E99-1051.txt,4,In this contribution we present some improvements on the design of a Dialogue Management System for the automatization of simple telephone tasks in a PABX environment automatic name dialing_comma_ voice messaging_comma_ ... .
E99-1051.txt,5,From the point of view of its functionality_comma_ our system is a very simple one because there is no need of advanced Plan Recognition strategies or General Problem Solving methods.
E99-1051.txt,6,However we think that even for these kind of dialogue sytems there is still a long way to demonstrate their usability in real situations by the general public .
E99-1051.txt,7,In our work we will concentrate on systems designed for the telephone line and for a wide range of potential users.
E99-1051.txt,8,Therefore our evaluations will be done taking into account different levels of speech recognition performance and user behaviours.
E99-1051.txt,9,In particular we will propose and evaluate strategies directed to increase the robustness against recognition errors and flexibility to deal with a wide range of users.
E99-1051.txt,10,We will use the PARADISE evaluation framework Walker et al._comma_ 1998 to analyze both task success and agent dialogue behaviour related to subjective user satisfaction.
E99-1051.txt,13,ETSIT UPM Spain 2 ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE SYSTEM Following the classification of Dialogue Systems proposed by Allen Allen_comma_ 1997 _comma_ our baseline clialogue system could be described as a system with topic based performance capabilities_comma_ adaptive single task_comma_ a minimal pair clarification correction dialogue manager and fixed mixed initiative.
E99-1051.txt,14,One of the most important objectives of our dialogue manager has been the implementation of a collaborative dialogue model.
E99-1051.txt,15,So the system has to be able to understand all the user actions_comma_ in whatever order they appear_comma_ and even if the focus of the dialogue has been changed by the user.
E99-1051.txt,16,In order to achieve this_comma_ we organize the information in an information tree_comma_ controlled by a task knowledge interpreter and we let the data to participate in driving the dialogue.
E99-1051.txt,17,However_comma_ to control a mixed initiative strategy we use three separate sources of information the user data_comma_ the world knowledge embedded in the task structure and the general dialogue acts.
E99-1051.txt,18,Therefore_comma_ from this preliminar evaluation of the system we found that in order to increase its permormance two major points should be addressed a robustness against recognition and parser errors_comma_ and b more flexibility to be able to deal with different user models.
E99-1051.txt,19,We designed four complementary strategies to improve its performance 1.
E99-1051.txt,20,To estimate the performance of the speech recognition module.
E99-1051.txt,21,This was done from a count on the number of corrections during previous interactions with the same user.
E99-1051.txt,23,To classify each user as belonging to group A or B that will be described later in the Experimental Results section.
E99-1051.txt,24,This was done combining a normalized average number of utterances per task and the amount of information in each utterance_comma_ especially at some particular dialogue points for example when answering to the question of our previous example .
E99-1051.txt,25,287 Proceedings of EACL 99 3.
E99-1051.txt,26,To include a control module that from the results of steps 1 and 2 defines two different kinds of control management allowing a flexible mixedinitiative strategy more user initiative for Group A users and high recognition rates_comma_ and more restictive strategies for Group B users and or low recognition performance.
E99-1051.txt,27,All of these strategies have been included in our system as it is depicted in Figure 1.
E99-1051.txt,28,3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In order to test the improvements over our original system described in Alvarez et al._comma_ 1996 we designed a simulated evaluation environment where the performance of the Speech Recognition Module recognition rate was artificially controlled.
E99-1051.txt,29,A Wizard of Oz simulation environment was designed to obtain different levels of recognition performance for a vocabulary of 1170 words 96.4 word recognition rate for high performance and 80 for low performance.
E99-1051.txt,30,A pre defined single fixed mixed initiative strategy was used in all the cases.
E99-1051.txt,31,We used an annotated data base composed of 50 dialogues with 50 different novice users and 6 different simple telephone tasks in each dialogue 25 dialogues were simulated using 94.6 recognition rate and 25 with 80 .
E99-1051.txt,32,Performance results were obtained using the PARADISE evaluation framework Walker et al._comma_ 1998 _comma_ determining the contributions of task success and dialogue cost to user satisfaction.
E99-1051.txt,33,Therefore as task success measure me obtained the Kappa coefficient while dialogue cost measures were based on the number of users turns.
E99-1051.txt,34,In this case it is important to point out that as each tested dialogue is composed of a set of six different tasks which have quantify different number of turns_comma_ the number of turns for each task was normalized to it s N x   score O x Both Group High ASR Lo ASR Hi ASR 0.68 0.81 1 0.61 User Turn 7.3 5.4 4.2 6.9 Satisf 26.4 30.1 35.4 25.2 Table 1 Shows means results for both group in low and high ASR.
E99-1051.txt,35,And separately for each Group A and B_comma_ only in high ASR situation User satisfaction in Table 1 was obtained as a cumulative satisfaction score for each dialogue by summing the scores of a set of questions similar t_comma_o those proposed in Walker et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1051.txt,36,The ANOVA for Kappa_comma_ the cost measure and user satisfaction demostrated a significant effect of ASR performance.
E99-1051.txt,37,As it could be predicted_comma_ we found that in all cases a low recognition rate corresponds to a dramatical decrease in the absolute number of suscessfully completed tasks and an important increase in the average number of utterances.
E99-1051.txt,38,However we also found that in high ASR situation the task success measure of Kappa was surprisingly low.
E99-1051.txt,39,A closer inspection of the dialogues in Table 1 revealed that this low performance under high ASR situations was due to the presence of two groups of users.
E99-1051.txt,40,A first group_comma_ Group A_comma_ showed a fluent interaction with the system_comma_ similar to the one supposed by the mixed initiative strategy for example_comma_ as an answer to the question of the system do you want to do any other task _comma_ these users could answer something like yes_comma_ I would like to send a message to John Smith .
E99-1051.txt,41,While the other group of users_comma_ Group B_comma_ exibited a very restrictive interaction with the system for example_comma_ a short answer yes for the same question .
E99-1051.txt,42,As a conclusion of this first evaluation we found that in order to increase the permormance of our baseline system_comma_ two major points should be addressed a robustness against recognition and parser errors_comma_ and b more flexibility to be able to deal with different user models.
E99-1051.txt,43,Therefore we designed an adaptive strategy to adapt our dialogue manager to Group A or B of users and to High and Low ASR situations.
E99-1051.txt,44,The adaptation was done based on linear discrimination_comma_ as it is ilustrated in Figure 2_comma_ using both the average number of turns and recognition errors from the two first tasks in each dialogue.
E99-1051.txt,45,Low ASR Both Gr.
E99-1051.txt,46,0.71 User Turn 7.2 Satisfaction 26.9 High ASR 1 0.83 5.3 6.1 32.1 29.4 Table 2 Shows means results for each Group in high ASR situations and for both in low ASR.
E99-1051.txt,47,Table 2 shows mean results for each Group A and B of users for High ASR performance_comma_ and for all users in Low ASR situations.
E99-1051.txt,48,These results show a more stable behaviour of the system_comma_ that is_comma_ less difference in performance between users of Group A and Group B and_comma_ although to a lower extend_comma_ between high and low recognition rates.
E99-1051.txt,49,4 CONCLUSIONS The main conclusion of the work is the necessity to design adaptive dialogue management strategies to make the system robust against recogniton performance and different user behaviours.

E99-1011.txt,1,TIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation SUMMAC has established definitively that automatic text summarization is very effective in relevance assessment tasks. Summaries as short as 17 of full text length sped up decisionmaking by almost a factor of 2 with no statistically significant degradation in Fscore accuracy.
E99-1011.txt,2,SUMMAC has also introduced a new intrinsic method for automated evaluation of informative summaries.
E99-1011.txt,4,In May 1998_comma_ the U.S. government completed the TIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation SUMMAC _comma_ which was the first large scale_comma_ developer independent evaluation of automatic text summarization systems.
E99-1011.txt,5,The goals of the SUMMAC evaluation were to judge individual summarization systems in terms of their usefulness in specific summarization tasks and to gain a better understanding of the issues involved in building and evaluating such systems.
E99-1011.txt,6,1.1 Text Summarization Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a set of sources to produce an abridged version for particular users and tasks Maybury 1995 .
E99-1011.txt,7,Since abridgment is crucial_comma_ an important parameter to summarization is the level of compression ratio of summary length to source length desired.
E99-1011.txt,8,Summaries can be used to indicate what topics are addressed in the source text_comma_ and thus can be used to alert the user as to source content the indicative function .
E99-1011.txt,9,In addition_comma_ summaries can also be used to stand in place of the source the informative function .

E99-1032.txt,1,will argue in this paper that the standard notions of affectedness_comma_ change of state and result state are too coarse grained_comma_ and will revise and enrich substantially their content_comma_ increasing their role in a compositional aspect construal procedure. I will claim in particular that a proper theory of event structure requires that enriched result states should be lexically represented_comma_ and will base on them a computational treatment of event structure within a feature structure based lexicon. .
E99-1032.txt,2,Event structure is traditionally accounted for using two sets of notions change of state affectedness and incrementality.
E99-1032.txt,3,I will examine both in this paper_comma_ determining their respective limitations_comma_ before proposing an alternative approach and the formal specifications for a computational implementation.
E99-1032.txt,4,1 From affectedness to result states how can we account for event structure .9 1.1 Affectedness_comma_ change of state and telicity Telic events are generally viewed as an opposition between a previously holding state and a new one_comma_ called a result state e.g. dead y for x kills y .
E99-1032.txt,5,They trigger a change of state COS_comma_ henceforth _comma_ result states RSs_comma_ henceforth being entailments of CoSs.
E99-1032.txt,6,Moens and Steedman 1988 _comma_ Smith 1991 _comma_ Pustejovsky 1995 _comma_ and others argue that it is a defining property of telic events.
E99-1032.txt,7,They should therefore include an undergoer argument_comma_ whose CoS determines the telicity of the event i.e._comma_ it acts as a measuring out argument .
E99-1032.txt,8,Tenny 1987 thus claims that telic events require such an argument_comma_ which she calls an affected argument.
E99-1032.txt,9,Consider for instance John reviewed the paper as the event reaches its culimation_comma_ the affected argument undergoes a CoS from _comma_reviewed paper to reviewed paper _comma_ producing a RS.
E99-1032.txt,10,To put it short_comma_ the standard theory of event structure says that telicity implies affectedness and conversely _comma_ and that affectedness implies a CoS RS and conversely _comma_ associating tightly all those notions.
E99-1032.txt,11,Unfortunately_comma_ not all measuring out arguments are affected arguments  1 Two men carried Hirsch on the deck.
E99-1032.txt,12,Jackendoff 1996 309 observed that implicit paths such as on the deck in 1 are not affected arguments_comma_ so that the telicity of such motion events cannot be explained using affectedness_comma_ ruling out a unified affectedness based account of telicityL It follows from this objection that the standard theory should be at least amended.
E99-1032.txt,13,Jackendoff s solution is a general mapping function from measuring out arguments seen as paths to events.
E99-1032.txt,14,It is related to incrementality_comma_ which I am discussing below.
E99-1032.txt,15,1.2 Result states and incrementality Event object mapping functions_comma_ as proposed in Krifka 1992 and Dowty 1991 _comma_ are another key approach to the treatment of event structure.
E99-1032.txt,16,Dowty 1991 calls an incremental theme any argument I Yet motion verbs could be attributed an affected argument_comma_ i.e._comma_ their agents_comma_ so thatJackendoff s point against affectedness does not seem to be decisive.
E99-1032.txt,17,233 Proceedings of EACL 99 capable of measuring out an event.
E99-1032.txt,18,For instance_comma_ the drinking event in 2 can be measured along the quantity of beer contained in the glass through functions mapping the latter onto the former.
E99-1032.txt,19,2 John drank a glass of beer.
E99-1032.txt,20,The glass of beer in 2 undergoes an incremental CoS_comma_ and is therefore an incremental theme.
E99-1032.txt,21,Pathobjects cf. Mary walked the Appalachian trail Tenny 1994 _comma_ can be treated as some special kind of incremental themes_comma_ and Jackendoff s solution could thus be reformulated using incrementality 2.
E99-1032.txt,22,Let us turn now to the treatment of so called achievement verbs cf. Vendler 1957 .
E99-1032.txt,23,Most authors do not grant them incremental themes.
E99-1032.txt,24,Dowty 1991 _comma_ for instance_comma_ argues that incremental themes must be able to undergo an incremental CoS 3a The horse finished crossing the line.
E99-1032.txt,25,OK in slow motion 3b The horses finished crossing the line.
E99-1032.txt,26,3a shows indeed that cross the line lacks proper subevents_comma_ and that no incremental CoS occurs.
E99-1032.txt,27,But Dowty never considered examples such as 3b _comma_ which receive an incremental reading albeit of a different kind_comma_ since the subevents construed in 3 involve individual parts of a set of objects rather than non individual parts of an individual object_comma_ as in 2 .
E99-1032.txt,28,Therefore_comma_ I will conclude that the kind of affected arguments which achievement verbs possess can also be regarded as incremental themes.
E99-1032.txt,29,It seems at this point that all kinds of telic events can be analysed in terms of incrementality.
E99-1032.txt,30,However_comma_ I will show in the following section that this is not the case.
E99-1032.txt,31,Generally speaking_comma_ relying on incrementality alone would mean relegating CoSs and RSs to the backstage of aspect construal 3 in order to account for telicity without affectedness_comma_ one should deny a central role to CoSs_comma_ and regard telicity primarily as a matter of measure.
E99-1032.txt,32,I will propose an alternative solution in the following sections preserving the centrality of CoS_comma_ yet departing from the standard 2 See Jackendoff I 996 for some syntactic provisos.
E99-1032.txt,33,3 At least in the case of path movement verbs_comma_ cf.
E99-1032.txt,34,1 . approach to affectedness and CoS_comma_ and justified by data falling outside the scope of incrementality.
E99-1032.txt,36,A richer conception of result states for a proper treatment of event structure 2.1 RSs with and without change of state I will argue here that different types of affectedness and RSs e.g._comma_ entailing a CoS for telic events_comma_ and not entailing a CoS for atelic ones should be distinguished_comma_ going against the predominant position.
E99-1032.txt,37,Few authors mention the possibility for atelic events to receive RSs_comma_ or do it incidentally e.g._comma_ Parsons 1990 .
E99-1032.txt,38,But consider the following data 4 Loom Mona has been very sick. t 5 Mona has already sailed.
E99-1032.txt,39,4 and 5 denote a present state of affairs Mona s poor looks in 4 sailing expertise in 5 following a past fact yet no CoS is involved.
E99-1032.txt,40,Let us now turn to verbs of gradual CoS 6 Mona cooked this chicken in for two hours.
E99-1032.txt,41,7 Mona has only slightly I not too much cooked her chicken.
E99-1032.txt,42,8 John has only slightly not too much drunk his glass of beer.
E99-1032.txt,43,6 can be read as telic or atelic_comma_ and although its internal argument is undergoing a CoS_comma_ it is not an incremental CoS_comma_ since the whole of the chicken is gradually affected and no__ t its subparts compare 2 .
E99-1032.txt,44,It seems rather that the progression of the cooking event depends on the internal structure of the associated RS the event develops as the chicken is more and more cooked see Ramchand 1997 for a similar analysis4 .
E99-1032.txt,45,The types of RSs and affectedness involved differ clearly from those of the incremental telic events considered so far.
E99-1032.txt,46,Such RSs as that of 4 Jackendoff 1996 also proposes RSs as paths for such events.
E99-1032.txt,47,But the impact on event structure of the difference between the scalar CoS in 6 and the incremental one in 2 cannot be motivated in such works_comma_ since it is related to a difference in the associated RSs.
E99-1032.txt,48,The incrementality approach misses this point_comma_ so that RS based paths are rather ad hoc devices.
E99-1032.txt,49,234 Proceedings of EACL 99 cook are scalar_comma_ i.e._comma_ can vary in terms of degrees see 7 _comma_ so that a final degree may or may not be reached.
E99-1032.txt,50,Contrariwise_comma_ incremental events are not endowed with scalar RSs affectedness cf. 8  one does not drink something to a certain degree intensity .
E99-1032.txt,51,It appears now that a proper treatment of event structure requires a richer conception of RSs_comma_ CoSs and affectedness_comma_ and cannot be exclusively based on incrementality. .Legend x y x overlaps with y x y x precedes y x y ordered part of relationship between events 9 drink e_comma_ x_comma_ y drink_IStage e_comma__comma_x_comma_y drink RStage e2_comma_y i drink_P_RS e3_comma_ y drink_S_RS e4_comma_ y F_comma_ e3 e 4 A e 3 e 1 Y ex e 2 I assume that events canonically break down into at least two stages RStages and Inner Stages noted IStages _comma_ the latter describing an events development e.g._comma_ the drinking process assumed to precede the end of a drinking event.
E99-1032.txt,52,Briefly_comma_ telic events will receive a binary RStage cf 10 consisting of a primary RS and a secondary RS_comma_ the former being related to the development of the event cf. John has been drinking beer and the latter to its culmination i.e._comma_ to the state of affairs arising from the event s final completion cf. John has drunk a beer .
E99-1032.txt,53,Moreover_comma_ the secondary RS should be the complementary of the primary RS_comma_ so as to cause a definite CoS 5.
E99-1032.txt,54,The diagrams 9 and 10 indicate that the primary RSs of drink and run overlap with their respective IStages_comma_ and that the Secondary RS of drink abuts with both its primary RS and IStage.
E99-1032.txt,55,Moreover_comma_ the sortal opposition between primary and secondary RSs should be viewed as a transition function.
E99-1032.txt,56,I assume here that transition functions i.e._comma_ functions allowing for CoSs require such binary sortal domains_comma_ in the spirit of Pustejovsky lbrthcoming .
E99-1032.txt,57,Some kind of causal relationship is 5 Path object verbs as in 1 can also be analysed in terms of RStages.
E99-1032.txt,58,I will not discuss here the treatment of this and many other event types for want of space.
E99-1032.txt,59,2.2 RStages as sets of sorted RSs To formulate an alternative treatment of event structure accounting for the data presented above_comma_ I will introduce result stages RStages henceforth _comma_ consisting of one or several RSs.
E99-1032.txt,60,I am moreover assuming here that semantic features and categories are treated within a multi sortal logic_comma_ possessing a hierarchy of sorts organized as an inheritance based lattice structure see White 1994 . x left overlaps with y ...... overlap relationship between events lO ru e_comma_x I run ZStage e x_comma_ x I I run RSt age e 2_comma_ x F_comma_ el e 2 also assumed to hold between IStages and RStages in the case of telic events.
E99-1032.txt,61,Telic scalar verbs like cook will receive binary RStages with scalar primary RSs.
E99-1032.txt,62,Scalar RSs will be defined through scalar sortal domains_comma_ so as to account for the behaviour of those verbs.
E99-1032.txt,63,I will not study here their atelic readings for want of space to do so.
E99-1032.txt,64,Finally_comma_ since atelic events do not entail a CoS_comma_ I will assign them unary RStages_comma_ devoid of primary RSs_comma_ so that no opposition between two RSs and therefore no CoS arises see 10 .
E99-1032.txt,66,Encoding RStages in the lexicon I will now propose the formal specifications for a lexical computational implementation of the above treatment.
E99-1032.txt,67,Each verb will be assigned a sorted RStage_comma_ sorts being used as well formedness conditions.
E99-1032.txt,68,I am proposing in figure 1 a lexical entry for drink within the Generative Lexicon framework cf. Pustejovsky 1995 .

E99-1032.txt,70,Note that the m inc and i inc functions are homomorphi aspectual roles relating events to the individual vs. material subparts of objects see Caudal 1999 for further details .

E99-1032.txt,75,Conclusion The treatment proposed here receives indirect support from recent developments in the syntax semantics interface underlining the importance of affectedness and CoS in argument structure and aspect construal cf.
E99-1032.txt,76,Ramchand 1998 .
E99-1032.txt,77,Yet the novelty of this approach to event structure should be stressed w.r.t. the standard notions prevailing in the even recent literature_comma_ while it does not belittle the role of the usual apparatus about IStages_comma_ telicity and eventobject mapping functions.
E99-1032.txt,78,It rather pairs them with RStages.
E99-1032.txt,79,Finally_comma_ the present account offers a more unified and explanatory treatment of event structure than those essentially based on incrementality_comma_ since they have to rely on RS based paths to explain the telicity of scalar verbs and resultative constructions.

E99-1009.txt,1,of lexical and derivational semantics for example substitution and lambda conversion is typically a part of the on line interpretation process. Proof nets are to categorial grammar what phrase markers are to phrase structure grammar unique graphical structures underlying equivalence classes of sequential syntactic derivations but the role of proof nets is deeper since they integrate also semantics.
E99-1009.txt,2,In this paper we show how interaction of lexical and derivational semantics at the lexico syntactic interface can be precomputed as a process of off line lexical compilation comprising Cut elimination in partial proof nets. .

E99-1009.txt,10,We show how such interaction of lexical and derivational semantics at the lexicosyntactic interface can be precomputed as a process of off line lexical compilation comprising Cut elimination in partial proof nets.
E99-1009.txt,11,For accessibility_comma_ we devote in the initial sections a considerable proportion of space to an .
E99-1029.txt,1,of the claimed benefits of Tree Adjoining Grammars is that they have an extended domain of locality EDOL . We consider how this can be exploited to limit the need for feature structure unification during parsing.
E99-1029.txt,2,We compare two wide coverage lexicalized grammars of English_comma_ LEXSYS and XTAG_comma_ finding that the two grammars exploit EDOL in different ways.
E99-1029.txt,4,One of the most basic properties of Tree Adjoining Grammars TAGS is that they have an extended domain of locality EDOL Joshi_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1029.txt,5,This refers to the fact that the elementary trees that make up the grammar are larger than the corresponding units the productions that are used in phrase structure rule based frameworks.
E99-1029.txt,6,The claim is that in Lexicalized TAGS LTAGs the elementary trees provide a domain of locality large enough to state co occurrence relationships between a lexical item the anchor of the elementary tree and the nodes it imposes constraints on.
E99-1029.txt,7,We will call this the extended domain of locality hypothesis.
E99-1029.txt,8,For example_comma_ wh movement can be expressed locally in a tree that will be anchored by a verb of which an argument is extracted.
E99-1029.txt,9,Consequently_comma_ features which are shared by the extraction site and the wh word_comma_ such as case_comma_ do not need to be percolated_comma_ but are directly identified in the tree.
E99-1029.txt,10,Figure 1 shows a tree in which the case feature at the extraction site and the wh word share the same value 1The anchor_comma_ substitution and foot nodes of trees are marked with the symbols o_comma_ and _comma_ respectively.
E99-1029.txt,11,Words in parenthesis are included in trees to provide examples of strings this tree can derive.
E99-1029.txt,12,Much of the research on TAGS can be seen as illustrating how its EDOL can be exploited in various ways.
E99-1029.txt,13,However_comma_ to date_comma_ only indirect evidence has been given regarding the beneficial effects of the EDOL on parsing efficiency.
E99-1029.txt,14,The argument_comma_ due to Schabes 1990 _comma_ is that benefits to parsing arise from lexicalization_comma_ and that lexicalization is only possible because of the EDOL.
E99-1029.txt,15,A parser dealing with a lexicalized grammar needs to consider only those elementary structures that can be associated with the lexical items appearing in the input.
E99-1029.txt,16,This can substantially reduce the effective grammar size at parse time.
E99-1029.txt,17,The argument that an EDOL is required for lexicalization is based on the observation that not every set of trees that can be generated by a CFG can be generated by a lexicalized CFG.
E99-1029.txt,18,But does the EDOL have any other more direct effects on parsing efficiency
E99-1029.txt,19,On the one hand_comma_ it is a consequence of the EDOL that wide coverage LTAGs are larger than their rule based counterparts.
E99-1029.txt,20,With larger elementary structures_comma_ generalizations are lost regarding the internal structure of the elementary trees.
E99-1029.txt,21,Since parse time depends on grammar size_comma_ this could have an adverse effect on parsing efficiency.
E99-1029.txt,22,However_comma_ the problem of grammar size in TAG has to some extent been addressed both with respect to grammar encoding Evans et al._comma_ 1995 Candito_comma_ 1996 and parsing Joshi and Srinivas_comma_ 1994 Evans and Weir_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1029.txt,23,On the other hand_comma_ if the EDOL hypothesis holds for those dependencies that are being checked by the parser_comma_ then the burden of passing feature values around during parsing will be less than in a rule based framework.
E99-1029.txt,24,If all dependencies that the parser is checking can be stated directly within the elementary structures of the grammar_comma_ they do not need to be computed dynamically during the parsing process by means of feature percolation.
E99-1029.txt,26,This paper presents an investigation into the extent to which the EDOL reduces the need for feature passing in two existing wide coverage grammars the XTAG grammar XTAG Group_comma_ 1995 _comma_ and the LEXSYS grammar Carroll et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1029.txt,27,It can be seen as an evaluation of how well these two grammars make use of the EDOL hypothesis with respect to those dependencies that are being checked by the parser.
E99-1029.txt,28,2 Parsing Unification Based Grammars In phrase structure rule based parsing_comma_ each rule corresponds to a local tree.
E99-1029.txt,29,A rule is applied to a sequence of existing contiguous constituents_comma_ if they are compatible with the daughters.
E99-1029.txt,30,In the case of context free grammar CFG _comma_ the compatibility check is just equality of atomic symbols_comma_ and an instantiated daughter is merely the corresponding sub constituent.
E99-1029.txt,31,However_comma_ unification based extensions of phrase structures grammars are used because they are able to encode local and non local syntactic dependencies for example_comma_ subjectverb agreement in English with re entrant features and feature percolation_comma_ respectively Constituents are represented by DAGS directed acyclic graphs _comma_ the compatibility check is unification_comma_ and it is the result of each unification that is used to instantiate the daughters.
E99-1029.txt,32,Graph unification based on the UNION FIND algorithm has time complexity that is near linear in the number of feature structure nodes in the inputs Huet_comma_ 1975 Ait Kaci_comma_ 1984 however_comma_ feature structures in wide coverage grammars can contain hundreds of nodes see e.g._comma_ HPSG Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 _comma_ and since unification is a primitive operation the overall number of unification attempts during parsing can be very large.
E99-1029.txt,33,Unification therefore has a substantial practical cost.
E99-1029.txt,34,Efficient graph unification must also ensure that it does not destructively modify the input structures_comma_ since the same rule may be used several times within a single derivation_comma_ and also the same constituent may be used within different partial analyses with features instantiated in different ways.
E99-1029.txt,35,Copying input feature structures in their entirety before each unification would solve this problem_comma_ but the space usage renders this approach impractical.
E99-1029.txt,36,Therefore_comma_ various quasi destructive algorithms Karttunen_comma_ 1986 Kogure_comma_ 1990 Tomabechi_comma_ 1991 and algorithms using skeletal DACS with updates Pereira_comma_ 1985 Emele_comma_ 1991 have been proposed_comma_ which attempt to minimize copying.
E99-1029.txt,37,But even with good implementations of the best of these improved algorithms_comma_ parsers designed for wide coverage unification based phrase structure grammars using large HPSG style feature graphs spend around 85 90 of their time unifying and copying feature structures Tomabechi_comma_ 1991 _comma_ and may allocate in the region of 1 2 Mbytes memory while parsing sentences of only eight words or so Flickinger_comma_ p.c. .
E99-1029.txt,38,Although comfortably within main memory capacities of current workstations_comma_ such large amounts of short term storage allocation overflow CPU caches_comma_ and storage management overheads become significant.
E99-1029.txt,39,In the case of unification based LTAG the situation is even more problematic.
E99-1029.txt,40,Elementary structures are larger than productions_comma_ and the potential is that the parser will have to make copies of entire trees and associated feature structures.
E99-1029.txt,42,On the other hand_comma_ the EDOL has the potential to eliminate some or all of feature percolation_comma_ and in the remainder of this section_comma_ we explain how.
E99-1029.txt,43,An LTAG consists of a set of unanchored trees such as the one shown on the left of Figure 2.
E99-1029.txt,44,This shows a tree for transitive verbs where subject verb agreement is captured directly with reentrancy between the value of agr feature structures at the anchor verb node and the subject node.
E99-1029.txt,45,Notice the re entrancy between the anchor node and the substitution node for the subject.
E99-1029.txt,46,However these are not the trees that the parser works with the parser is given trees that have been anchored by the morphologically analysed words in the input sentence.
E99-1029.txt,47,For example_comma_ the tree shown on the right is the result of anchoring the tree shown on the left with the word loves.
E99-1029.txt,48,Anchoring instantiates the agr feature of the anchor node as 3sg which has the effect due to the reentrancy in the unanchored tree of instantiating the agr feature at the subject node as 3sg.
E99-1029.txt,49,Anchored elementary trees are translated by the parser into a sequence of what we will refer to as parser actions.
E99-1029.txt,50,For example_comma_ once the tree shown on the right of Figure 2 has been associated with the word loves in the input_comma_ it can be recognized with a sequence of parser actions that involve finding a NP constituent on the right corresponding to the object _comma_ possibly performing adjunctions at the VP node_comma_ and then finding another NP constituent on the left corresponding to the subject .
E99-1029.txt,51,We say that the two NP substitution nodes and the VP node are the sites of parser actions in this tree.
E99-1029.txt,52,Problems arise_comma_ and the EDOL hypothesis is violated_comma_ when there is a dependence between different parser actions.
E99-1029.txt,53,The EDOL hypothesis states that elementary trees provide a domain of locality large enough to state co occurrence relationship between the anchor of the tree and the nodes it imposes constraints on.
E99-1029.txt,54,If all dependencies relevant to the parser can be captured in this way then_comma_ once an elementary tree has been anchored by a particular lexical item_comma_ the settings of feature values at all of the dependent nodes will have been fixed_comma_ and no feature percolation can occur.
E99-1029.txt,55,Each unification is a purely local operation with no repercussions on the rest of the parsing process.
E99-1029.txt,56,No copying of feature structures is required_comma_ so memory usage is greatly reduced_comma_ and complex quasidestructive algorithms with their associated computational overheads can be dispensed with.
E99-1029.txt,57,Note that_comma_ although feature percolation is eliminated when the EDOL hypothesis holds_comma_ the feature structure at a node can still change.
E99-1029.txt,58,For example_comma_ substituting a tree for a proper noun at the subject position of the tree in Figure 2 would cause the .feature structure at the node for the subject to include pn .
E99-1029.txt,59,This_comma_ however_comma_ does not violate the EDOL hypothesis since this feature is not coreferenced with any other feature in the tree.
E99-1029.txt,60,3 Analysis of two wide coverage grammars As we have seen_comma_ the EDOL of LTAGs makes it possible_comma_ at least in principle_comma_ to locally express dependencies which cannot be localized in a CFGbased formalism.
E99-1029.txt,61,In this section we consider two existing grammars the XTAG grammar_comma_ a widecoverage LTAG_comma_ and the LEXSYS grammar_comma_ a widecoverage D Tree Substitution Grammar Rambow et al._comma_ 1995 .
E99-1029.txt,62,For each grammar we investigate the extend to which they do not take full advantage of the EDOL and require percolation of features at parse time.
E99-1029.txt,63,There are a number of instances in which dependencies are not localized in the XTAG grammar_comma_ most of which involve auxiliary trees.
E99-1029.txt,64,There are 219 Proceedings of EACL 99 three types of auxiliary trees predicative_comma_ modifier and coordination auxiliary trees.
E99-1029.txt,65,In predicative auxiliary trees the anchor is also the head of the tree and becomes the head of the tree resulting from the adjunction.
E99-1029.txt,66,In modifier auxiliary trees_comma_ the anchor is not the head of the tree_comma_ and the subtree headed by the anchor usually plays a role of adjunct in the resulting tree.
E99-1029.txt,67,Coordination auxiliary trees are similar to modifier auxiliary trees in that they are anchored by the conjunction which is not the head of the phrase.
E99-1029.txt,68,One of the conjoined nodes is a foot node_comma_ the other one a substitution node.
E99-1029.txt,69,3.1 Modifier Auxiliary Trees In modifier auxiliary trees an example of which is shown in Figure 32 the feature values at the root and foot nodes are set by the node at which the auxiliary tree is adjoined_comma_ and have to be percolated between the foot node and the root node.
E99-1029.txt,70,The LEXSYS grammar adopts a similar account of modification.
E99-1029.txt,71,From a parsing point of view_comma_ this does not result in the need for feature percolation only the foot node of the modifier tree is the site of a parser action_comma_ and the root node is ignored by the process that interprets the tree for the parser.
E99-1029.txt,72,3.2 Coordination Auxiliary Trees An example of an XTAG coordination auxiliary tree is shown on the left of Figure 4.
E99-1029.txt,73,This case is different from the modification case since features of the substitution node have to be identical to features of the foot node which wiIl match those at the adjunction site .
E99-1029.txt,74,From a parsing point of view these nodes are both the sites of actions_comma_ resulting in the need for feature percolation.
E99-1029.txt,75,For example_comma_ for the NP coordination tree shown in Figure 4_comma_ if one of the conjuncts is a wh phrase_comma_ the other conjunct must be a wh phrase too_comma_ as in who or what did this but John and who did this
E99-1029.txt,76,The wh feature has to be percolated between the two nodes on each side of the conjunction.
E99-1029.txt,77,In the LEXSYS grammar_comma_ a coordination tree is anchored by a head of the tree_comma_ not by the conjunction.
E99-1029.txt,78,To illustrate see the tree on the right of Figure 4 _comma_ N P coordination trees are anchored by a noun_comma_ and features such as wh and case are ground during anchoring.
E99-1029.txt,79,As a result_comma_ there is no need for passing of these features in the coordination trees of the LEXSYS grammar.
E99-1029.txt,80,2All examples relating to the XTAG grammar come from the XTAG report XTAG Group_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1029.txt,81,They have been simplified to the extent that only details relevant to the discussion are included.
E99-1029.txt,82,As for agreement features_comma_ there are two cases to consider if the conjunction is and_comma_ the number feature of the whole phrase is plural if the conjunction is or_comma_ the number feature is the same as the last conjunct s XTAG Group_comma_ 1999 .
E99-1029.txt,83,In both the XTAG and LEXSYS grammars_comma_ this is achieved by having separate trees for each type of conjunction.
E99-1029.txt,84,3.3 Predicative Auxiliary Trees In the XTAC grammar_comma_ subject raising and auxiliary verbs anchor auxiliary trees rooted in VP_comma_ without a subject3 they can be adjoined at the VP node of any compatible verb tree.
E99-1029.txt,85,With this arrangement_comma_ subject verb agreement must be established dynamically.
E99-1029.txt,86,The agr feature of the NP subject must match the agr feature of whichever VP ends up being highest at the end of the derivation.
E99-1029.txt,87,In Figure 5_comma_ the bought tree has been anchored in such a way that adjunction at the VP node is obligatory_comma_ since a matrix clause cannot have mode ppart.
E99-1029.txt,88,4 When the tree for has is adjoined at the VP node the agr features of the subject will agree with those of bought.
E99-1029.txt,89,The feature structure at the root of the tree for has is unified with the upper feature structure at the VP node of the tree for bought_comma_ and the feature structure at the foot of the tree for has is unified with the lower feature structure at the VP node of the tree for bought.
E99-1029.txt,90,The foot node of the has tree is the VP node on the frontier of the tree.
E99-1029.txt,91,Note that even after the tree has been anchored_comma_ re entrancy of features occurs in the tree.
E99-1029.txt,92,Thus_comma_ there are two sites in the tree for bought the subject NP node and the VP node at which parser actions will take place substitution and adjunction_comma_ respectively such that a dependency between the values of the features at these two nodes must be established by the parser.
E99-1029.txt,93,The situation is similar for case assignment also shown in the Figure 5 the value of a feature ass case the assign case feature on the highest VP is coreferred with the value of the feature case on the subject NP.
E99-1029.txt,94,For finite verbs_comma_ the value of the feature ass case is determined by the mode of the verb.
E99-1029.txt,95,For infinitive verbs_comma_ case is assigned in various ways_comma_ the details of which are not relevant to the discussion here.
E99-1029.txt,96,The subject is in the nominative case if the verb is finite_comma_ and in the accusative otherwise.
E99-1029.txt,97,As with the agr feature_comma_ the value of the case feature cannot be instantiated 3To allow for long distance dependency_comma_ subject raising verbs must anchor an auxiliary tree_comma_ with identical root and foot nodes_comma_ a VP.
E99-1029.txt,98,4Unifying the two feature structures at the VP node would cause a matrix clause to have mode ppart.
E99-1029.txt,101,The same observations apply to the XTAG treatment of copula with predicative categories such as an adjective.
E99-1029.txt,102,As shown in Figure 6_comma_ these predicative AP trees have a subject but no verb trees for raising verbs or the copula can be adjoined into them.
E99-1029.txt,103,As in the previous example_comma_ the agr features of the verb and subject cannot be instantiated in the elementary tree because the verb and its subject are not present in the same tree.
E99-1029.txt,104,From the examples we have seen_comma_ it appears that the XTAG grammar does not take full advantage of the EDOL with respect to a number of syntactic features_comma_ for example those relating to agreement and case.
E99-1029.txt,105,The LEXSYS grammar takes a rather different approach to phenomena that XTAG handles with predicative auxiliary trees.
E99-1029.txt,106,The LEXSYS grammar has been designed to localize syntactic dependencies in elementary trees.
E99-1029.txt,107,As in the XTAC grammar_comma_ unbounded dependencies between gap and filler are localized in elementary trees but unlike the XTAG grammar_comma_ other types of syntactic dependencies_comma_ such as agreement_comma_ are also localized.
E99-1029.txt,108,All finite verbs_comma_ including auxiliary and raising verbs_comma_ anchor a tree rooted in S_comma_ and thus are in the same tree as the subject with which they agree.
E99-1029.txt,109,An example involving finite verbs is shown in Figure 7.
E99-1029.txt,110,Since verb trees cannot be substituted between the subject and the verb_comma_ the agr feature can be grounded when elementary trees are anchored_comma_ rather than during the derivation.
E99-1029.txt,111,The case feature of the subject can be specified even in the unanchored elementary tree in trees for finite verbs the subject has nominative case in trees for for ... to clauses it has accusative case.
E99-1029.txt,112,As can be seen from the tree on the right of Figure 7_comma_ subject raising and auxiliary verbs are rooted in S and take a VP complement.
E99-1029.txt,113,So the sentence He seems to like apples is produced by substituting a VP rooted tree for to like into a tree for seems.
E99-1029.txt,114,Thus_comma_ for all three trees shown in Figure 7_comma_ once anchoring has taken place_comma_ all of the syntactic features being checked by the parser are grounded.
E99-1029.txt,115,Hence_comma_ the parser does not have to check for dependencies between the parser actions taking place at different sites in the tree.
E99-1029.txt,117,As shown in Figure 6_comma_ in XTAG the predicative adjective and its subject are localized in the same elementary tree_comma_ and selectional restrictions can be locally imposed by the adjective on the subject without the need for feature percolation.
E99-1029.txt,118,On the other hand_comma_ in the LEXSYS grammar_comma_ the dependency between upset and he in he looks upset could not be checked during parsing without the use of feature passing between the subject and AP node of the tree in the middle of Figure 7.
E99-1029.txt,119,3.5 Percolation of Features in LEXSYS This section considers a limited number of cases where it appears that it is not possible to set all syntactic features by anchoring an elementary tree.
E99-1029.txt,120,When two nodes other than the anchor of the tree are syntactically dependent_comma_ feature values may have to be percolated between these nodes the anchor does not determine the value of these features .
E99-1029.txt,121,For example_comma_ in English adjectives that can have S subjects determine the verb form of the subject.
E99-1029.txt,122,Hence_comma_ in Figure 8_comma_ the verb form feature of the subject is not determined by the anchor of the tree the verb but by the complement of the anchor the adjective .
E99-1029.txt,123,The verb form feature must therefore be percolated from the adjective phrase to the subject.
E99-1029.txt,124,The XTAG grammar localizes this dependency see Figure 6 .
E99-1029.txt,125,However_comma_ as we have seen_comma_ agreement features are not localized in this analysis.
E99-1029.txt,126,The problem then is that it does not seem to be possible to localize all syntactic features in this case.
E99-1029.txt,127,Feature percolation is also required in the LEXSYS grammar for prepositional phrases which contain a wh word_comma_ because the value of the wh feature is not set by the anchor of the phrase the preposition but by the complement as in these reports_comma_ the wording on the covers of which has caused so much controversy_comma_ are to be destroyed5 .
E99-1029.txt,128,The value of the feature wh is set by the N Pcomplement_comma_ and percolated to the root of the PP.
E99-1029.txt,129,4 Conclusions In XTAG both syntactic and semantic features are considered during parsing_comma_ whereas in the LEXSYS 5Example borrowed from Gazdar et al. 1985.
E99-1029.txt,131,The LEXSYS parser returns a complete set of all syntactically wellformed derivations.
E99-1029.txt,132,Semantic information can be recovered from derivation trees and then processed as desired.
E99-1029.txt,133,From a processing point of view_comma_ the XTAG and LEXSYS grammars are examples that show that the checking of dependencies involves a trade off.
E99-1029.txt,134,6 On the one hand_comma_ a greater number of parses may be returned if the only dependencies checked are syntactic_comma_ since possible violations of semantic dependencies are ignored.
E99-1029.txt,135,On the other hand_comma_ as we have seen in this paper_comma_ there are potentially substantial benefits to parsing efficiency if all dependencies that the parser is checking can be localized with the EDOL.
E99-1029.txt,136,It is tOO early to say how best to make the trade off_comma_ but by comparing the way that the XTAG and LEXSYS grammars exploit the EDOL_comma_ we hope to have shed some light on the role that the EDOL can play with respect to parsing efficiency.
E99-1029.txt,137,6These are both grammars for English.
E99-1029.txt,138,Hence_comma_ whether the conclusions we draw apply to other languages is outside the scope of the present work.

E99-1047.txt,1,short paper describes and in fact gives the complete source for a tiny Prolog program implementing a flexible and fairly efficient TransformationBased Learning TBL system 1 . Transformation Based Learning Brill_comma_ 1995 is a well established learning method in NLP circles.
E99-1047.txt,2,This short paper presents a light version of the TBL system a genera _comma_ logically transparent_comma_ flexible and efficient transformation based learner presented in Lager_comma_ 1999 .
E99-1047.txt,3,It turns out that a transformation based learner_comma_ complete with a compiler for templates_comma_ can be implemented in less than one page of Prolog code.
E99-1047.txt,4,2 TBL Rules Representations The point of departure for TBL is a tagged initialstate corpus and a correctly tagged training corpus.
E99-1047.txt,5,Assuming the part of speech tagging task_comma_ corpus data can be represented by means of three kinds of clauses wd P_comma_W is true iff the word W is at position P in the corpus tag P_comma_A is true iff the word at position P in the corpus is tagged A tag A_comma_B_comma_P is true iff the word at P is tagged A and the correct tag for the word at P is B Although this representation may seem a bit redundant_comma_ it provides exactly the kind of indexing into the data that is needed3 A decent Prolog system can deal with millions of such clauses.
E99-1047.txt,6,1 Assuming a Prolog with first argument indexing.
E99-1047.txt,7,The TBL systems are implemented in SICStus Prolog.
E99-1047.txt,8,The object of TBL is to learn an ordered sequence of transformation rules.
E99-1047.txt,9,Such rules dictate when based on the context a word should have its tag changed.
E99-1047.txt,11,Conditions may refer to different features_comma_ and complex conditions may be composed from simpler ones.
E99-1047.txt,13,Rules that can be learned in TBL are instances of templates_comma_ such as replace tag A with B if the word immediately to the left has tag C _comma_ where A_comma_ B and C are variables.
E99-1047.txt,15,Positive and negative instances of rules that are instances of this template can be generated by means of the following clauses pos t3 A_comma_B_comma_C dif A_comma_B _comma_tag A_comma_B_comma_P _comma_Pl is P l_comma_tag Pl_comma_C .
E99-1047.txt,16,neg t3 A_comma_B_comma_C tag A_comma_A_comma_P _comma_P1 is P l_comma_tag Pi_comma_C .
E99-1047.txt,17,Tied to each template is also a procedure that will apply rules that are instances of the template app t3 A_comma_B_comma_C  tag A_comma_X_comma_P _comma_ Pl is P l_comma_ tag Pl_comma_C _comma_ retract tag A_comma_X_comma_P _comma_ retract tag P_comma_A _comma_ assert tag B_comma_X_comma_P _comma_ assert tag P_comma_B _comma_ fail true .
E99-1047.txt,18,3 The TBL Template Compiler To write clauses such as the above by hand for large sets of templates would be tedious and prone to errors.

E99-1047.txt,40,In each case_comma_ the accuracy of the resulting sequence of rules was measured on a test corpus consisting of 40k words_comma_ with an initial state accuracy of 93.3 .

E99-1026.txt,1,paper describes a dependency structure analysis of Japanese sentences based on the maximum entropy models. Our model is created by learning the weights of some features from a training corpus to predict the dependency between bunsetsus or phrasal units.
E99-1026.txt,2,The dependency accuracy of our system is 87.2 using the Kyoto University corpus.
E99-1026.txt,3,We discuss the contribution of each feature set and the relationship between the number of training data and the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,5,Dependency structure analysis is one of the basic techniques in Japanese sentence analysis.
E99-1026.txt,6,The Japanese dependency structure is usually represented by the relationship between phrasal units called bunsetsu. The analysis has two conceptual steps.
E99-1026.txt,7,In the first step_comma_ a dependency matrix is prepared.
E99-1026.txt,8,Each element of the matrix represents how likely one bunsetsu is to depend on the other.
E99-1026.txt,9,In the second step_comma_ an optimal set of dependencies for the entire sentence is found.
E99-1026.txt,10,In this paper_comma_ we will mainly discuss the first step_comma_ a model for estimating dependency likelihood.
E99-1026.txt,11,So far there have been two different approaches to estimating the dependency likelihood_comma_ One is the rule based approach_comma_ in which the rules are created by experts and likelihoods are calculated by some means_comma_ including semiautomatic corpusbased methods but also by manual assignment of scores for rules.
E99-1026.txt,12,However_comma_ hand crafted rules have the following problems. They have a problem with their coverage.
E99-1026.txt,13,Because there are many features to find correct dependencies_comma_ it is difficult to find them manually. They also have a problem with their consistency_comma_ since many of the features compete with each other and humans cannot create consistent rules or assign consistent scores. As syntactic characteristics differ across different domains_comma_ the rules have to be changed when the target domain changes.
E99-1026.txt,14,It is costly to create a new hand made rule for each domain.
E99-1026.txt,15,At other approach is a fully automatic corpusbased approach.
E99-1026.txt,16,This approach has the potential to overcome the problems of the rule based approach.
E99-1026.txt,17,It automatically learns the likelihoods of dependencies from a tagged corpus and calculates the best dependencies for an input sentence.
E99-1026.txt,18,We take this approach.
E99-1026.txt,19,This approach is taken by some other systems Collins_comma_ 1996 Fujio and Matsumoto_comma_ 1998 Haruno et ah_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1026.txt,20,The parser proposed by Ratnaparkhi Ratnaparkhi_comma_ 1997 is considered to be one of the most accurate parsers in English.
E99-1026.txt,21,Its probability estimation is based on the maximum entropy models.
E99-1026.txt,22,We also use the maximum entropy model.
E99-1026.txt,23,This model learns the weights of given features from a training corpus.
E99-1026.txt,24,The weights are calculated based on the frequencies of the features in the training data.
E99-1026.txt,25,The set of features is defined by a human.
E99-1026.txt,26,In our model_comma_ we use features of bunsetsu_comma_ such as character strings_comma_ parts of speech_comma_ and inflection types of bunsetsu_comma_ as well as information between bunsetsus_comma_ such as the existence of punctuation_comma_ and the distance between bunsetsus.
E99-1026.txt,27,The probabilities of dependencies are estimated from the model by using those features in input sentences.
E99-1026.txt,28,We assume that the overall dependencies in a whole sentence can be determined as the product of the probabilities of all the dependencies in the sentence.
E99-1026.txt,29,196 Proceedings of EACL 99 Now_comma_ we briefly describe the algorithm of dependency analysis.
E99-1026.txt,30,It is said that Japanese dependencies have the following characteristics.
E99-1026.txt,31,1 Dependencies are directed from left to right 2 Dependencies do not cross 3 A bunsetsu_comma_ except for the rightmost one_comma_ depends on only one bunsetsu 4 In many cases_comma_ the left context is not necessary to determine a dependency 1 The analysis method proposed in this paper is designed to utilize these features.
E99-1026.txt,32,Based on these properties_comma_ we detect the dependencies in a sentence by analyzing it backwards from right to left .
E99-1026.txt,33,In the past_comma_ such a backward algorithm has been used with rule based parsers e.g._comma_ Fujita_comma_ 1988 .
E99-1026.txt,34,We applied it to our statistically based approach.
E99-1026.txt,35,Because of the statistical property_comma_ we can incorporate a beam search_comma_ an effective way of limiting the search space in a backward analysis.
E99-1026.txt,36,2 The Probability Model Given a tokenization of a test corpus_comma_ the problem of dependency structure analysis in Japanese can be reduced to the problem of assigning one of two tags to each relationship which consists of two bunsetsus.
E99-1026.txt,37,A relationship could be tagged as 0 or 1 to indicate whether or not there is a dependency between the bunsetsus_comma_ respectively.
E99-1026.txt,38,The two tags form the space of futures for a maximum entropy formulation of our dependency problem between bunsetsus.
E99-1026.txt,40,Like most current M.E. modeling efforts in computational linguistics_comma_ we restrict ourselves to features which are binary functions of the history and aAssumption 4 has not been discussed very much_comma_ but our investigation with humans showed that it is true in more than 90 of cases. future.
E99-1026.txt,41,For instance_comma_ one of our features is g 1 g h_comma_f t 0 Here has h_comma_z is a binary function which returns true if the history h has an attribute x.
E99-1026.txt,42,We focus on attributes on a bunsetsu itself and those between bunsetsus.
E99-1026.txt,43,Section 3 will mention these attributes.
E99-1026.txt,44,Given a set of features and some training data_comma_ the maximum entropy estimation process produces a model in which every feature gi has associated with it a parameter ai.

E99-1026.txt,72,For the entire test corpus the average running time on a SUN Sparc Station 20 was 0.08 seconds per sentence.
E99-1026.txt,73,3.2 Features and Accuracy This section describes how much each feature set contributes to improve the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,74,The rightmost column in Tables 1 and 2 shows the performance of the analysis without each feature set.
E99-1026.txt,75,In parenthesis_comma_ the percentage of improvement or degradation to the formal experiment is shown.
E99-1026.txt,76,In the experiments_comma_ when a basic feature was deleted_comma_ the combined features that included the basic feature were also deleted.
E99-1026.txt,77,We also conducted some experiments in which several types of features were deleted together.
E99-1026.txt,78,The results are shown in Table 4.
E99-1026.txt,79,All of the results in the experiments were carried out deterministically beam width k 1 .
E99-1026.txt,80,The results shown in Table 1 were very close to our expectation.
E99-1026.txt,81,The most useful features are the type of the anterior bunsetsu and the partof speech tag of the head word on the posterior bunsetsu.
E99-1026.txt,82,Next important features are the distance between bunsetsus_comma_ the existence of punctuation in the bunsetsu_comma_ and the existence of brackets.
E99-1026.txt,83,These results indicate preferential rules with respect to the features.
E99-1026.txt,84,The accuracy obtained with the lexical features of the head word was better than that without them.
E99-1026.txt,85,In the experiment with the features_comma_ we found many idiomatic expressions_comma_ for example_comma_ _comma__comma_ 15 C oujile_comma_ according to b b kimeru_comma_ decide and  katachi_de_comma_ in the form of  b okonawareru_comma_ be held . We would expect to collect more of such expressions if we use more training data.
E99-1026.txt,86,The experiments without some combined features are reported in Tables 2 and 4.
E99-1026.txt,87,As can be seen from the results_comma_ the combined features are very useful to improve the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,88,We used these combined features in addition to the basic features because we thought that the basic features were actually related to each other.
E99-1026.txt,89,Without the combined features_comma_ the features are independent of each other in the maximum entropy framework.
E99-1026.txt,90,We manually selected combined features_comma_ which are shown in Table 2.
E99-1026.txt,91,If we had used all combi200 Proceedings of EACL 99 Table 4 Accuracy without several types of features Features Without features 1 and 16 lexical information about the head word Without features 35 to 43 Without quadruplet and quintuplet features Without triplet_comma_ quadruplet_comma_ and quintuplet features Without all combinations Accuracy 86.30 0.84 86.83 0.31 84.27 2.87 81.28 5.86 68.83 18.31 nations_comma_ the number of combined features would have been very large_comma_ and the training would not have been completed on the available machine.
E99-1026.txt,92,Furthermore_comma_ we found that the accuracy decreased when several new features were added in our preliminary experiments.
E99-1026.txt,93,So_comma_ we should not use all combinations of the basic features.
E99-1026.txt,94,We selected the combined features based on our intuition.
E99-1026.txt,95,In our future work_comma_ we believe some methods for automatic feature selection should be studied.
E99-1026.txt,96,One of the simplest ways of selecting features is to select features according to their frequencies in the training corpus.
E99-1026.txt,97,But using this method in our current experiments_comma_ the accuracy decreased in all of the experiments.
E99-1026.txt,98,Other methods that have been proposed are one based on using the gain Berger et al._comma_ 1996 and an approximate method for selecting informative features Shirai et al._comma_ 1998a _comma_ and several criteria for feature selection were proposed and compared with other criteria Berger and Printz_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1026.txt,99,We would like to try these methods.
E99-1026.txt,100,Investigating the sentences which could not be analyzed correctly_comma_ we found that many of those sentences included coordinate structures.
E99-1026.txt,101,We believe that coordinate structures can be detected to a certain extent by considering new features which take a wide range of information into account.
E99-1026.txt,102,3.3 Number of Training Data and Accuracy Figure 2 shows the relationship between the number of training data the number of sentences and the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,103,This figure shows dependency accuracies for the training corpus and the test corpus.
E99-1026.txt,104,Accuracy of 81.84 was achieved even with a very small training set 250 sentences .
E99-1026.txt,105,We believe that this is due to the strong characteristic of the maximum entropy framework to the data sparseness problem.
E99-1026.txt,106,From the learning curve_comma_ we can expect a certain amount of improvement if we have more training data.
E99-1026.txt,107,3.4 Comparison with Related Works This section compares our work with related statistical dependency structure analyses in Japanese.
E99-1026.txt,108,Comparison with Shirai s work Shirai et al._comma_ 1998b Shirai proposed a framework of statistical language modeling using several corpora the EDR corpus_comma_ RWC corpus_comma_ and Kyoto University corpus.
E99-1026.txt,109,He combines a parser based on a hand made CFG and a probabilistic dependency model.
E99-1026.txt,110,He also used the maximum entropy model to estimate the dependency probabilities between two or three post positional particles and a verb.
E99-1026.txt,111,Accuracy of 84.34 was achieved using 500 test sentences of length 7 to 9 bunsetsus.
E99-1026.txt,112,In both his and our experiments_comma_ the input sentences were morphologically analyzed and their bunsetsus were identified.
E99-1026.txt,113,The comparison of the results cannot strictly be done because the conditions were different.
E99-1026.txt,114,However_comma_ it should be noted that the accuracy achieved by our model using sentences of the same length was about 3 higher than that of Shirai s model_comma_ although we used a much smaller set of training data.
E99-1026.txt,115,We believe that it is because his approach is based on a hand made CFG.
E99-1026.txt,116,Comparison with Ehara s work Ehara_comma_ 1998 Ehara also used the Maximum Entropy model_comma_ and a set of similar kinds of features to ours.
E99-1026.txt,117,However_comma_ there is a big difference in the number of features between Ehara s model and ours.
E99-1026.txt,118,Besides the difference in the number of basic features_comma_ Ehara uses only the combination of two features_comma_ but we also use triplet_comma_ quadruplet_comma_ and quintuplet features.
E99-1026.txt,119,As shown in Section 3.2_comma_ the accuracy increased more than 5 using triplet or larger combinations.
E99-1026.txt,120,We believe that the difference in the combination features between Ehara s model and ours may have led to the difference in the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,121,The accuracy of his system was about 10 lower than ours.
E99-1026.txt,122,Note that Ehara used TV news articles for training and testing_comma_ which are different from our corpus.
E99-1026.txt,123,The average sentence length in those articles was 17.8_comma_ much longer than that average 10.0 in the Kyoto University text corpus.
E99-1026.txt,124,Comparison with Fujio s work Fujio and Matsumoto_comma_ 1998 and Haruno s work Haruno et al._comma_ 1998 Fujio used the Maximum Likelihood model with similar features to our model in his parser.
E99-1026.txt,125,Haruno proposed a parser that uses decision tree 201 Proceedings of EACL 99 A 0 O_comma_.

E99-1026.txt,128,It is difficult to directly compare these models with ours because they use a different corpus_comma_ the EDR corpus which is ten times as large as our corpus_comma_ for training and testing_comma_ and the way of collecting test data is also different.
E99-1026.txt,129,But they reported an accuracy of around 85 _comma_ which is slightly worse than our model.
E99-1026.txt,130,We carried out two experiments using almost the same attributes as those used in their experiments.
E99-1026.txt,131,The results are shown in Table 5_comma_ where the lines Feature set l and Feature set 2 show the accuracies achieved by using Fujio s attributes and Haruno s attributes respectively.
E99-1026.txt,132,Considering that both results are around 85 to 86 _comma_ which is about the same as ours.
E99-1026.txt,133,From these experiments_comma_ we believe that the important factor in the statistical approaches is not the model_comma_ i.e.
E99-1026.txt,134,Maximum Entropy_comma_ Maximum Likelihood_comma_ or Decision Tree_comma_ but the feature selection.
E99-1026.txt,135,However_comma_ it may be interesting to compare these models in terms of the number of training data_comma_ as we can imagine that some models are better at coping with the data sparseness problem than others.
E99-1026.txt,136,This is our future work.
E99-1026.txt,137,4 Conclusion This paper described a Japanese dependency structure analysis based on the maximum entropy model.
E99-1026.txt,138,Our model is created by learning the weights of some features from a training corpus to predict the dependency between bunsetsus or phrasal units.
E99-1026.txt,139,The probabilities of dependencies between bunsetsus are estimated by this model.
E99-1026.txt,140,The dependency accuracy of our system was 87.2 using the Kyoto University corpus.
E99-1026.txt,141,In our experiments without the feature sets shown in Tables 1 and 2_comma_ we found that some basic and combined features strongly contribute to improve the accuracy.
E99-1026.txt,142,Investigating the relationship between the number of training data and the accuracy_comma_ we found that good accuracy can be achieved even with a very small set of training data.
E99-1026.txt,143,We believe that the maximum entropy framework has suitable characteristics for overcoming the data sparseness problem.
E99-1026.txt,144,There are several future directions.
E99-1026.txt,145,In particular_comma_ we are interested in how to deal with coordinate structures_comma_ since that seems to be the largest problem at the moment. .
E99-1004.txt,1,may be seen as comprising commonplace routines on the one hand and specialized_comma_ task specific interactions on the other. Object orientation is an established means of separating the generic from the specialized.
E99-1004.txt,2,The system under discussion combines this objectoriented approach with a self organizing_comma_ mixed initiative dialogue strategy_comma_ raising the possibility of dialogue systems that can be assembled from ready made components and tailored_comma_ specialized components.
E99-1004.txt,4,For the purpose of developing automated systems_comma_ dialogues may be seen as comprising commonplace routines on the one hand and specialized_comma_ task specific interactions on the other.
E99-1004.txt,5,In software engineering_comma_ object orientation has proved to be an effective means of separating the generic from the specialized_comma_ and more particularly_comma_ of letting the specialized inherit the generic Rumbaugh et al._comma_ 1991 .
E99-1004.txt,6,Identifying inheritable generic functionality for confirmation_comma_ repair of misunderstanding_comma_ personalization of utterances_comma_ etc. and specialized or highly domainspecific functionality_comma_ opens the way to dialogue systems that can be assembled largely from readymade components and extended with the addition of more specialized components.
E99-1004.txt,7,The prototype system that we have been developing in Prolog for the last year combines this familiar objectoriented approach with a self organizing_comma_ mixedinitiative dialogue strategy.
E99-1004.txt,8,Pseudocode is used here to represent the Prolog processing.
E99-1004.txt,9,2 Identifying the generic and the specialized In the course of developing the prototype system a number of important generic elements have been identified that can be ported with a minimum of alteration between domains.
E99-1004.txt,10,These generic elements are now introduced.
E99-1004.txt,11,2.1 Dialogue Manager In any system that is concerned with conducting a dialogue with a user_comma_ a mechanism is required for receiving_comma_ forwarding for processing_comma_ and outputting semantic contents of utterances.
E99-1004.txt,12,This responsibility falls to a Dialogue Manager.
E99-1004.txt,13,2.2 Domain Spotter Any system that is intended to handle processing across a number of real world areas of expertise requires a means of associating key semantic content of the user s utterances with one or more of the available domains.
E99-1004.txt,14,This responsibility falls to the Domain Spotter.
E99-1004.txt,15,2.3 Discourse Stack Any system dealing with a transaction that involves multiple dialogue turns must have a means of logging a what it believes the user has said_comma_ b the degree of confirmedness of what has been said_comma_ and c how the system has decided to respond.
E99-1004.txt,16,Maintaining a record of the evolving discourse_comma_ and providing the means of creating and retrieving entries for individual utterances_comma_ are the responsibilities of the Discourse Stack.
E99-1004.txt,17,23 Proceedings of EACL 99 2.4 Enquiry Processor Given the current difficulties of speech recognition_comma_ and the possibility that a user will misunderstand or change his or her mind_comma_ any system conducting a complex transaction must have a strategy for confirming the semantic contents of the user s utterances and for proceeding with the transaction only when details have been adequately confirmed.
E99-1004.txt,18,The current system increments or decrements levels of confirmedness depending on whether the user repeats or confirms_comma_ alters or negates values.
E99-1004.txt,19,If necessary_comma_ the system queries the user explicitly about values that are new_comma_ altered or negated.
E99-1004.txt,20,The responsibility for these purely generic_comma_ mechanistic confirmation routines falls to the Enquiry Processor_comma_ whose strategies are inherited_comma_ via a generic agent or Expert_comma_ by subclasses that have their own domain specific processing heuristics.
E99-1004.txt,21,2.5 Expert Each of the more specialized agents within the system must have access to wider system resources and have ways of providing the wider system with high level information about its processing abilities.
E99-1004.txt,22,Supporting these common behaviours and characteristics is the responsibility of the generic Expert class.
E99-1004.txt,23,Other parts of the system must be tailored to represent the specialized knowledge and processing abilities of real world human specialists.
E99-1004.txt,24,These are introduced next.
E99-1004.txt,25,2.6 Expert Subclasses For each business area within the system there must be functionality a to decide what information to elicit next_comma_ or what information to infer_comma_ given that certain information may already Dialogue Manager
E99-1004.txt,26,Domain Spotter Event Expert A have been provided_comma_ b to check the validity of the combinations of information provided_comma_ c to give the most helpful guidance when the user is having difficulty completing the enquiry_comma_ and d to decide when sufficient_comma_ confirmed information has been provided to conclude the transaction.
E99-1004.txt,27,Such functionality is specific to the Expert subclasses within the system_comma_ and recreates in sometimes quite extensive sets of domain specific heuristics_comma_ the kind of behaviour e.g. if details for an outward journey are received_comma_ check if a return is needed if a venue has been confirmed but not a day_comma_ ask for the day that would characterize any human expert in a particular business domain a travel agent or a theatre booking clerk_comma_ for instance.
E99-1004.txt,28,The current subclasses are Travel Expert_comma_ Event Expert and Place Expert.
E99-1004.txt,29,2.7 Expert Instances The system must contain detailed service information of the kind that in the real world is associated with individual businesses.
E99-1004.txt,30,Businesses are represented by instances of Expert subclasses.
E99-1004.txt,31,The instances represent particular airlines_comma_ railways_comma_ theatres_comma_ cinemas and so on they have access to the data concrete schedules and timetables that must be consulted if a transaction is to be meaningful.
E99-1004.txt,32,3 Some important system characteristics The current prototype Figure 1 below focuses on dialogue management.
E99-1004.txt,33,It is not intended to transcribe and parse raw spoken input_comma_ nor compose complete utterances for speech generation.
E99-1022.txt,1,propose a parser for constraintlogic grammars implementing HPSG that combines the advantages of dynamic bottom up and advanced topdown control. The parser allows the user to apply magic compilation to specific constraints in a grammar which as a result can be processed dynamically in a bottom up and goal directed fashion.
E99-1022.txt,2,State of the art top down processing techniques are used to deal with the remaining constraints.
E99-1022.txt,3,We discuss various aspects concerning the implementation of the parser as part of a grammar development system.
E99-1022.txt,5,In case of large grammars the space requirements of dynamic parsing often outweigh the benefit of not duplicating sub computations.
E99-1022.txt,6,We propose a parser that avoids this drawback through combining the advantages of dynamic bottom up and advanced top down control.
E99-1022.txt,7,1 The underlying idea is to achieve faster parsing by avoiding tabling on sub computations which are not expensive.
E99-1022.txt,8,The so called selective magic parser allows the user to apply magic compilation to specific constraints in a grammar which as a result can be processed dynamically in a bottom up and goal directed fashion.
E99-1022.txt,9,State of the art top down processing techniques are used to deal with the remaining constraints.
E99-1022.txt,10,Magic is a compilation technique originally developed for goal directed bottom up processing of logic programs.
E99-1022.txt,11,See_comma_ among others_comma_ Ramakrishnan et al. 1992 .
E99-1022.txt,12,As shown in Minnen_comma_ 1996 The presented research was carried out at the University of Tfibingen_comma_ Germany_comma_ as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340.
E99-1022.txt,13,1A more detailed discussion of various aspects of the proposed parser can be found in Minnen_comma_ 1998 . magic is an interesting technique with respect to natural language processing as it incorporates filtering into the logic underlying the grammar and enables elegant control independent filtering improvements.
E99-1022.txt,14,In this paper we investigate the selective application of magic to typed feature grammars a type of constraint logic grammar based on Typed Feature Logic Tgv GStz_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1022.txt,15,Typed feature grammars can be used as the basis for implementations of Head driven Phrase Structure Grammar HPSG Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 as discussed in GStz and Meurers_comma_ 1997a and Meurers and Minnen_comma_ 1997 .
E99-1022.txt,16,Typed feature grammar constraints that are inexpensive to resolve are dealt with using the top down interpreter of the ConTroll grammar development system GStz and Meurers_comma_ 1997b which uses an advanced search function_comma_ an advanced selection function and incorporates a coroutining mechanism which supports delayed interpretation.
E99-1022.txt,17,The proposed parser is related to the so called Lemma Table deduction system Johnson and DSrre_comma_ 1995 which allows the user to specify whether top down sub computations are to be tabled.
E99-1022.txt,18,In contrast to Johnson and DSrre s deduction system_comma_ though_comma_ the selective magic parsing approach combines top down and bottom up control strategies.
E99-1022.txt,19,As such it resembles the parser of the grammar development system Attribute Language Engine ALE of Carpenter and Penn_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1022.txt,20,Unlike the ALE parser_comma_ though_comma_ the selective magic parser does not presuppose a phrase structure backbone and is more flexible as to which sub computations are tabled filtered.
E99-1022.txt,21,Bottom up Interpretation of Magic compiled Typed Feature Grammars We describe typed feature grammars and discuss their use in implementing HPSG grammars.
E99-1022.txt,22,Subsequently we present magic compilation of typed 165 Proceedings of EACL 99 feature grammars on the basis of an example and introduce a dynamic bottom up interpreter that can be used for goM directed interpretation of magic compiled typed feature grammars.
E99-1022.txt,23,2.1 Typed Feature Grammars A typed feature grammar consists of a signature and a set of definite clauses over the constraint language of equations ofTY GStz_comma_ 1995 terms HShfeld and Smolka_comma_ 1988 which we will refer to as Torz definite clauses.
E99-1022.txt,24,Equations over TJr terms can be solved using graph unification provided they are in normal form.
E99-1022.txt,25,GStz_comma_ 1994 describes a normal form for ir r terms_comma_ where typed feature structures are interpreted as satisfiable normal form T r terms.
E99-1022.txt,26,2 The signature consists of a type hierarchy and a set of appropriateness conditions.
E99-1022.txt,27,Example 1 The signature specified in figure 1 and 2 and the T r definite clauses in figure 3 constitute an example of a typed feature grammar.
E99-1022.txt,28,We write T r terms in normal form_comma_ i. e._comma_ relation Figure 2 Example of a typed feature grammar signature part 2 as typed feature structures.
E99-1022.txt,29,In addition_comma_ uninformative feature specifications are ignored and typing is left implicit when immaterial to the example at hand.
E99-1022.txt,30,Equations between typed feature structures are removed by simple substitution or tags indicating structure sharing.
E99-1022.txt,31,Notice that we also use non numerical tags such as and .
E99-1022.txt,32,In general all boxed items indicate structure sharing.
E99-1022.txt,33,For expository reasons we represent the ARGn features of the append relation as separate arguments.
E99-1022.txt,34,Typed feature grammars can be used as the basis for implementations of Head driven Phrase Structure Grammar Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1022.txt,35,3 Meurers and Minnen_comma_ 1997 propose a compilation of lexical rules into T r definite clauses 2This view of typed feature structures differs from the perspective on typed feature structures as modehng partial information as in Carpenter_comma_ 1992 .
E99-1022.txt,36,Typed feature structures as normal form ir E terms are merely syntactic objects.
E99-1022.txt,37,aSee King_comma_ 1994 for a discussion of the appropriateness of T  for HPSG and a comparison with other feature logic approaches designed for HPSG.
E99-1022.txt,40,GStz and Meurers_comma_ 1997b describe a method for compiling implicational constraints into typed feature grammars and interleaving them with relational constraints.
E99-1022.txt,41,4 Because of space limitations we have to refrain from an example.
E99-1022.txt,42,The ConTroll grammar development system as described in GStz and Meurers_comma_ 1997b implements the above mentioned techniques for compiling an HPSG theory into typed feature grammars.
E99-1022.txt,43,2.2 Magic Compilation Magic is a compilation technique for goal directed bottom up processing of logic programs.
E99-1022.txt,44,See_comma_ among others_comma_ Ramakrishnan et al. 1992 .
E99-1022.txt,45,Because magic compilation does not refer to the specific constraint language adopted_comma_ its application is not limited to logic programs grammars It can be applied to relational extensions of other constraint languages such as typed feature grammars without further adaptions.
E99-1022.txt,46,Due to space limitations we discuss magic compilation by example only.
E99-1022.txt,47,The interested reader is referred to Nilsson and Maluszynski_comma_ 1995 for an .
E99-1036.txt,1,paper presents a framework for the definition of monotonic repair rules on chart items and Lexicalized Tree Grammars. We exploit island representations and a new level of granularity for the linearization of a tree called connected routes.
E99-1036.txt,2,It allows to take into account the topology of the tree in order to trigger additional rules.
E99-1036.txt,3,These local rules cover ellipsis and common extra grammatical phenomena such as self repairs.
E99-1036.txt,4,First results with a spoken language corpora are presented. .
E99-1036.txt,5,In the context of spoken task oriented manmachine and question answering dialogues_comma_ one of the most important problem is to deal with spontaneous and unexpected syntactical phenomena.
E99-1036.txt,6,Utterances can be very incomplete and difficult to predict which questions the principle of grammaticality.
E99-1036.txt,7,Moreover large covering grammars are generally dedicated to written text parsing and it is not easy to exploit such a grammar for the analysis of spoken language even if complex syntax does not occur.
E99-1036.txt,8,For such sentences_comma_ robust parsing techniques are necessary to extract a maximum of information from the utterance even if a Complete parsing fails at least all possible constituents .
E99-1036.txt,9,Considering parsing of word graphs and the large search space of parsing algorithms in order to compute all possible ambiguities_comma_ the number of partial parses can be very important.
E99-1036.txt,10,A robust semantic processing on these partial derivations would result in a prohibitive number of hypotheses.
E99-1036.txt,11,We argue in this paper that appropriate syntactical constraints expressed in a Lexicalized Tree Grammar LTG can trigger efficient repair rules for specific oral phenomena.
E99-1036.txt,12,First results of a classical grammatical parsing are presented_comma_ they show that robust parsing need to cope with oral phenomena.
E99-1036.txt,13,We argue then that extended domain of locality and lexicalization of LTG can be exploited in order to express repair local rules for these specific spoken phenomena.
E99-1036.txt,14,First results of this approach are presented.
E99-1036.txt,15,1 LTG parsing and repairing strategy 1.1 Experimental results Table 1 presents parsing test results of the Gocad corpora.
E99-1036.txt,16,This corpora contains 861 utterances in French of transcribed spontaneous spoken language collected with a Wizard of Oz experiment Chapelier et al._comma_ 1995 .
E99-1036.txt,17,We used a bottom up parser Lopez_comma_ 1998b for LTAG.
E99-1036.txt,18,The size of the grammar was limited compared with Candito_comma_ 1999 and corresponds to the sublanguage used in the Gocad application.
E99-1036.txt,19,However designing principles of the grammar was close to the large covering French LTAG grammar just including additional elementary trees for example for unexpected adverbs which can modify predicative nouns and a notation enrichment for the possible ellipsis occurrences Lopez_comma_ 1998a .
E99-1036.txt,20,The LTAG grammar for the sublanguage corresponds to a syntactical lexicon of 529 entries and a set of 80 non instancied elementary trees.
E99-1036.txt,21,A taxonomy of parsing errors occurring in oral dialogue shows that the majority of failures are linked to orality hesitations_comma_ repetitions_comma_ self repairs and some head ellipsis.
E99-1036.txt,22,The table 2 gives the occurrence of these oral phenomena in the Gocad corpora.
E99-1036.txt,23,Of course more than one phenomenon can occur in the same utterance.
E99-1036.txt,24,Prediction of these spoken phenomena would result in a very high parsing cost.
E99-1036.txt,25,However if we can detect these oral phenomena with additional techniques combining partial results_comma_ the number of hypotheses at the semantic level will decrease.

E99-1014.txt,1,paper proposes an approach to full parsing suitable for Information Extraction from texts. Sequences of cascades of rules deterministically analyze the text_comma_ building unambiguous structures.
E99-1014.txt,2,Initially basic chunks are analyzed then argumental relations are recognized finally modifier attachment is performed and the global parse tree is built.
E99-1014.txt,3,The approach was proven to work for three languages and different domains.
E99-1014.txt,4,It was implemented in the IE module of FACILE_comma_ a EU project for multilingual text classification and E.
E99-1014.txt,6,Most successful approaches in IE Appelt et al._comma_ 1993 Grishman_comma_ 1995 Aone et al._comma_ 1998 make a very poor use of syntactic information.
E99-1014.txt,7,They are generally based on shallow parsing for the analysis of non recursive NPs and Verba Groups VGs .
E99-1014.txt,8,After such step regular patterns are applied in order to trigger primitive actions that fill template s meta rules are applied to patterns to cope with different syntactic clausal forms e.g._comma_ passive forms .
E99-1014.txt,9,If we consider the most complex MUC 7 task i.e._comma_ the Scenario Template task MUC7_comma_ 1998 _comma_ the current technology is not able to provide results near an operational level expected F 1 75 the best system scored about 50 Aone et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1014.txt,10,One of the limitations of the current technology is the inability to extract and to represent syntactic relations among elements in the sentence_comma_ i.e. grammatical functions and thematic roles.
E99-1014.txt,11,Scenario Template recognition needs the correct treatment of syntactic relations at both sentence and text level Aone et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1014.txt,12,Full parsing systems are generally able to correctly model syntactic relations_comma_ but they tend to be slow because of huge search spaces and brittle because of gaps in the grammar .
E99-1014.txt,13,The use of big grammars partially solves the problem of gaps but worsens the problem of huge search spaces and makes grammar modifications difficult Grishman_comma_ 1995 .
E99-1014.txt,14,Grammar modifications are always to be taken into account.
E99-1014.txt,15,Many domain specific texts present idiosyncratic phenomena that require non standard rules.
E99-1014.txt,16,Often such phenomena are limited to some cases only e.g._comma_ some types of coordinations are applied to people only and not to organizations .
E99-1014.txt,17,Inserting generic rules for such structures introduces useless extra complexity into the search space and when applied indiscriminately e.g._comma_ on classes other than people can worsen the system results.
E99-1014.txt,18,It is not clear how semantic restrictions can be introduced into big generic grammars.
E99-1014.txt,19,In this paper we propose an approach to full parsing for IE based on cascades of rules.
E99-1014.txt,20,The approach is inspired by the use of finite state cascades for parsing e.g._comma_ Abney_comma_ 1996 uses them in a project for inducing lexical dependencies from corpora .
E99-1014.txt,21,Our work is interesting in an IE perspective because it proposes a method for efficiently and effectively performing full parsing on texts a way of organizing generic grammars that simplifies changes_comma_ insertion of new rules and especially integration of domain oriented rules.
E99-1014.txt,22,The approach proposed in this paper for parsing has been extended to the whole architecture of an IE system.
E99-1014.txt,23,Also lexical lexical normalization and preparsing _comma_ semantic default reasoning and template filling and discourse modules are based on the same approach.
E99-1014.txt,24,The system has been developed as part of FACILE Ciravegna et al._comma_ 1999 _comma_ a successfully completed project funded by the European Union.
E99-1014.txt,25,FACILE deals with text classification and information extraction from text in 102 Proceedings of EACL 99 the financial domain.
E99-1014.txt,26,The proposed approach has been tested mainly for Italian_comma_ but proved to work also for English and_comma_ as of the time of this writing_comma_ partially for Russian.
E99-1014.txt,27,Applications and demonstrators have been built in four different domains.
E99-1014.txt,28,In this paper we first introduce the adopted formalism and then go into details on grammar organization and on the different steps through which parsing is accomplished.
E99-1014.txt,29,Finally we present some experimental results.
E99-1014.txt,30,2 Representation and Rules Every lexical element a in the input sentence w is .
E99-1050.txt,1,paper proposes a novel_comma_ corpusbased_comma_ method for producing mappings between lexical resources. Results from a preliminary experiment using part of speech tags suggests this is a promising area for future research.
E99-1050.txt,3,Dictionaries are now commonly used resources in NLP systems.
E99-1050.txt,4,However_comma_ different lexical resources are not uniform they contain different types of information and do not assign words the same number of senses.
E99-1050.txt,5,One way in which this problem might be tackled is by producing mappings between the senses of different resources_comma_ the dictionary mapping problem .
E99-1050.txt,6,However_comma_ this is a non trivial problem_comma_ as examination of existing lexical resources demonstrates.
E99-1050.txt,7,Lexicographers have been divided between lumpers _comma_ or those who prefer a few general senses_comma_ and splitters who create a larger number of more specific senses so there is no guarantee that a word will have the same number of senses in different resources.
E99-1050.txt,8,Previous attempts to create lexical mappings have concentrated on aligning the senses in pairs of lexical resources and based the mapping decision on information in the entries.
E99-1050.txt,9,For example_comma_ Knight and Luk 1994 merged WordNet and LDOCE using information in the hierarchies and textual definitions of each resource.
E99-1050.txt,10,Thus far we have mentioned only mappings between dictionary senses.
E99-1050.txt,11,However_comma_ it is possible to create mappings between any pair of linguistic annotation tag sets for example_comma_ part of speech tags.
E99-1050.txt,12,We dub the more general class lexical mappings_comma_ mappings between two sets of lexical annotations.
E99-1050.txt,13,One example which we shall consider further is that of mappings between part of speech tags sets.
E99-1050.txt,14,This paper shall propose a method for producing lexical mappings based on corpus evidence.
E99-1050.txt,15,It is based on the existence of large scale lexical annotation tools such as part of speech taggers and sense taggers_comma_ several of which have now been developed_comma_ for example Brill_comma_ 1994 Stevenson and Wilks_comma_ 1999 .
E99-1050.txt,16,The availability of such taggers bring the possibility of automatically annotating large bodies of text.
E99-1050.txt,17,Our proposal is_comma_ briefly_comma_ to use a pair of taggers with each assigning annotations from the lexical tag sets we are interested in mapping.
E99-1050.txt,18,These taggers can then be applied to_comma_ the same_comma_ large body of text and a mapping derived from the distributions of the pair of tag sets in the corpus.
E99-1050.txt,19,2 Case Study In order to test this approach we attempted to map together two part of speech tag sets.
E99-1050.txt,20,We chose this form of linguistic annotation because it is commonly used in NLP systems and reliable taggers are readily available.
E99-1050.txt,21,The tags sets we shall examine are the set used in the Penn Tree Bank PTB Marcus et al._comma_ 1993 and the C5 tag set used by the CLAWS part of speech tagger Garside_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1050.txt,22,The PTB set consists of 48 annotations while the C5 uses a larger set of 73 tags.
E99-1050.txt,23,A portion of the British National Corpus BNC _comma_ consisting of nearly 9 million words_comma_ was used to derive a mapping.
E99-1050.txt,24,One advantage of using the BNC is that it has already been tagged with C5 tags.
E99-1050.txt,25,The first stage was to re tag our corpus using the Brill tagger Brill_comma_ 1994 .
E99-1050.txt,26,This produces a bi tagged corpus in which each token has two annotations.
E99-1050.txt,27,For example ponders VBZ VVZ_comma_ which represents the token is ponders assigned the Brill tag VBZ and VVZ C5 tag.
E99-1050.txt,28,The bi tagged corpus was used to derive a pair of mappings the word mapping and the tag mapping.
E99-1050.txt,29,To construct the word mapping from the PTB to C5 we look at each token PTB tag pair 285 Proceedings of EACL 99 and found the C5 tag which occurs with it most frequently.
E99-1050.txt,30,The tag mapping does not consider tokens so_comma_ for example_comma_ the PTB to C5 tag mapping looks at each PTB tag in turn to find the C5 tag with which it occurs most frequently in the corpus.
E99-1050.txt,31,The C5 to PTB mappings were derived by reversing this process.
E99-1050.txt,32,In order to test our method we took a text tagged with one of the two tag sets used in our experiments and translate that tagging to the other.
E99-1050.txt,33,We then compare the newly annotated text against some with gold standard tagging.
E99-1050.txt,34,It is trivial to obtain text annotated with C5 tags using the BNC.
E99-1050.txt,35,Our evaluation of the C5 to PTB mapping shall operate by tagging a text using the Brill tagger_comma_ using the derived mapping to translate the annotations to C5 tags and compare the annotations produced with those in the BNC text.
E99-1050.txt,36,However_comma_ it is more difficult to obtain gold standard text for evaluating the mapping in the reverse direction since we do not have access to a part of speech tagger which assigns C5 tags.
E99-1050.txt,37,That is_comma_ we cannot annotate a text with C5 tags_comma_ use our mapping to translate these to PTB tags and compare against the manual annotations from the corpus.
E99-1050.txt,38,Instead of tagging the unannotated text we use the existing C5 tags and translate those to PTB tags.
E99-1050.txt,39,Each approach to producing gold standard data has problems and advantages.
E99-1050.txt,40,The Brill tagger has a reported error rate of 3 and so cannot be expected to produce perfectly annotated text.
E99-1050.txt,41,However_comma_ when we tag the text with PTB tags and use the mapping to translate these taggings to C5 annotations we have no way to determine whether erroneous C5 tags were produced by errors in the Brill tagging or the mapping.
E99-1050.txt,42,Our test corpus was a text from the BNC consisting of 40_comma_397 tokens.
E99-1050.txt,43,Both word and tag mappings were created in each direction PTB to C5 and C5 to PTB .
E99-1050.txt,44,To apply the tag mapping we simply used it to convert the assigned annotation from one tag set to the other.
E99-1050.txt,45,However_comma_ when the word mapping is applied there is the danger that a word tag pair may not appear in the mapping and_comma_ if this is the case_comma_ the tag mapping is used as a default map.
E99-1050.txt,46,The results from our evaluation are shown in Table 1.
E99-1050.txt,47,We can see that the C5 to PTB word mapping produces impressive results which are close to the theoretical upper bound of 97 for the task.
E99-1050.txt,48,In addition the word mapping in the opposite direction is correct for 95 of tokens.
E99-1005.txt,1,paper explores the determinants of adjective noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus based variables co occurrence frequency of the adjective noun pair_comma_ noun frequency_comma_ conditional probability of the noun given the adjective_comma_ the log likelihood ratio_comma_ and Resnik s 1993 selectional association measure. The highest correlation is obtained with the co occurrence frequency_comma_ which points to the strongly lexicalist and collocational nature of adjective noun combinations.
E99-1005.txt,3,Research on linguistic plausibility has focused mainly on the effects of argument plausibility during the processing of locally ambiguous sentences.
E99-1005.txt,4,Psycholinguists have investigated whether the plausibility of the direct object affects reading times for sentences like 1 .
E99-1005.txt,5,Here_comma_ argument plausibility refers to pragmatic plausibility or local semantic fit Holmes et al._comma_ 1989 _comma_ and judgements of plausibility are typically obtained by asking subjects to rate sentence fragments containing verb argument combinations as an example consider the bracketed parts of the sentences in 1 .
E99-1005.txt,6,Such experiments typically use an ordinal scale for plausibility e.g._comma_ from 1 to 7 .
E99-1005.txt,10,The majority of research has focussed on investigating the effect of rated plausibility for verb object combinations in human sentence processing Garnsey et al._comma_ 1997 Pickering and Traxler_comma_ 1998 .
E99-1005.txt,11,However_comma_ plausibility effects have also been observed for adjectivenoun combinations in a head modifier relationship.
E99-1005.txt,12,Murphy 1990 has shown that typical adjectivenoun phrases e.g._comma_ salty olives are easier to interpret in comparison to atypical ones e.g._comma_ sweet olives .
E99-1005.txt,13,Murphy provides a schema based explanation for this finding by postulating that in typical adjective noun phrases_comma_ the adjective modifies part of the noun s schema and consequently it is understood more quickly_comma_ whereas in atypical combinations_comma_ the adjective modifies non schematic aspects of the noun_comma_ which leads to interpretation difficulties.
E99-1005.txt,14,Smadja 1991 argues that the reason people prefer strong tea to powerful tea and powerful car to strong car is neither purely syntactic nor purely semantic_comma_ but rather lexical.
E99-1005.txt,15,A similar argument is put forward by Cruse 1986 _comma_ who observes that the adjective spotless collocates well with the noun kitchen_comma_ relatively worse with the noun complexion and not all with the noun taste.
E99-1005.txt,16,According to Cruse_comma_ words like spotless have idiosyncratic collocational restrictions differences in the degree of acceptability of the adjective and its collocates do not seem to depend on the meaning of the individual words.
E99-1005.txt,17,1.1 Motivation Acquiring plausibility ratings for word combinations e.g._comma_ adjective noun_comma_ verb object_comma_ noun noun can be useful in particular for language generation.
E99-1005.txt,18,Consider a generator which has to make a choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen.
E99-1005.txt,19,An empirical model of plausibility could predict that spotless kitchen is a plausible lexical choice_comma_ while flawless kitchen is not.
E99-1005.txt,20,Adjective noun combinations can be hard to generate given their collocational status.
E99-1005.txt,21,For a generator which selects words solely on semantic grounds without taking into account lexical constraints_comma_ the choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen may look equivalent.
E99-1005.txt,22,Current work in natural language generation Knight and Hatzivassiloglou_comma_ 1995 Langkilde and Knight_comma_ 1998 has shown that corpus based knowledge can be used to address lexical choice noncompositionally.
E99-1005.txt,23,30 Proceedings of EACL 99 In the work reported here we acquire plausibility ratings for adjective noun combinations by eliciting judgements from human subjects_comma_ and examine the extent to which different corpus based models correlate with human intuitions about the goodness of fit for a range of adjective noun combinations.
E99-1005.txt,24,The research presented in this paper is similar in motivation to Resnik s 1993 work on selectional restrictions.
E99-1005.txt,25,Resnik evaluated his informationtheoretic model of selectional constraints against human plausibility ratings for verb object combinations_comma_ and showed that_comma_ in most cases_comma_ his model assigned higher selectional association scores to verb object combinations which were judged more plausible by human subjects.
E99-1005.txt,26,We test five corpus based models against human plausibility judgements 1.
E99-1005.txt,27,Familiarity of adjective noun pair.
E99-1005.txt,28,We operationalise familiarity as co occurrence frequency in a large corpus.
E99-1005.txt,29,We calculate the co occurrence frequency of adjective noun pairs in order to examine whether high corpus frequency is correlated with plausibility_comma_ and correspondingly low corpus frequency with implausibility.
E99-1005.txt,31,Familiarity of head noun.
E99-1005.txt,32,We compare rated plausibility with the corpus frequency of the head noun_comma_ the motivation being that highly frequent nouns are more familiar than less frequent ones_comma_ and consequently may affect the judged plausibility of the whole noun phrase.
E99-1005.txt,35,Our inclusion of the conditional probability_comma_ P noun I adjective _comma_ as a predictor variable also relies on the prediction that plausibility is correlated with corpus frequency.
E99-1005.txt,36,It differs from simple co occurrence frequency in that it additionally takes the overall adjective frequency into account.
E99-1005.txt,39,We employ the loglikelihood ratio as a measure of the collocational status of the adjective noun pair Dunning_comma_ 1993 Daille_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1005.txt,40,If we assume that plausibility differences between strong tea and powerful tea or guilty verdict and guilty cat reflect differences in collocational status i.e._comma_ appearing together more often than expected by their individual occurrence frequencies _comma_ as opposed to being semantic in nature_comma_ then the log likelihood ratio may also predict adjective noun plausibility.
E99-1005.txt,43,Finally_comma_ we evaluate plausibility ratings against Resnik s 1993 measure of selectional association.
E99-1005.txt,44,This measure is attractive because it combines statistical and knowledge based methods.
E99-1005.txt,45,By exploiting a knowledge based taxonomy_comma_ it can capture conceptual information about lexical items and hence can make predictions about word combinations which have not been seen in the corpus.
E99-1005.txt,46,In the following section we describe our method for eliciting plausibility judgements for adjective noun combinations.
E99-1005.txt,47,Section 3 reports the results of using the five corpus based models as predictors of adjectivenoun plausibility.
E99-1005.txt,48,Finally_comma_ section 4 offers some discussion of future work_comma_ and section 5 concluding remarks.
E99-1005.txt,49,2 Collecting Plausibility Ratings In order to evaluate the different corpus based models of adjective noun plausibility introduced above_comma_ we first needed to establish an independent measure of plausibility.
E99-1005.txt,50,The standard approach used in experimental psycholinguistics is to elicit judgements from human subjects in this section we describe our method for assembling the set of experimental materials and collecting plausibility ratings for these stimuli.
E99-1005.txt,51,2.1 Method Materials and Design.
E99-1005.txt,52,The ideal test of any of the proposed models of adjective noun plausibility will be with randomly chosen materials.
E99-1005.txt,53,We chose 30 adjectives according to a set of minimal criteria detailed below _comma_ and paired each adjective with a noun selected randomly from three different frequency ranges_comma_ which were defined by co occurrence counts in the 100 million word British National Corpus BNC Burnard 1995 .
E99-1005.txt,54,The experimental design thus consisted of one factor_comma_ Frequency Band_comma_ with three levels High_comma_ Medium_comma_ and Low .
E99-1005.txt,55,We chose the adjectives to be minimally ambiguous each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet Miller et al._comma_ 1990 and was unambiguously tagged as adjective 98.6 of the time_comma_ measured as the number of different part of speech tags assigned to the word in the BNC.
E99-1005.txt,56,The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million.
E99-1005.txt,57,We identified adjective noun pairs by using Gsearch Corley et al._comma_ 1999 _comma_ a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a userspecified context free grammar and a syntactic query.
E99-1005.txt,58,Gsearch was run on a lemmatised version of the BNC so as to compile a comprehensive corpus count of all nouns occurring in a modifier head relationship with each of the 30 adjectives.
E99-1005.txt,59,Examples of the syntactic patterns the parser identified are given in Table 1.
E99-1005.txt,60,From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser we extracted a table containing the adjective and the head of the noun phrase following it.
E99-1005.txt,61,In the case of compound nouns_comma_ we only included sequences of two 31 Proceedings of EACL 99 nouns_comma_ and considered the rightmost occurring noun as the head.
E99-1005.txt,62,From the retrieved adjective noun pairs_comma_ we removed all pairs where the noun had a BNC frequency of less than 10 per million_comma_ as we wanted to reduce the risk of plausibility ratings being influenced by the presence of a noun unfamiliar to the subjects.
E99-1005.txt,63,Finally_comma_ for each adjective we divided the set of pairs into three bands High_comma_ Medium_comma_ and Low _comma_ based on an equal division of the range of log transformed co occurrence frequency_comma_ and randomly chose one noun from each band.
E99-1005.txt,64,Example stimuli are shown in Table 2.
E99-1005.txt,65,The mean log co occurrence frequencies were 3.839_comma_ 2.066 and .258_comma_ for the High_comma_ Medium_comma_ and Low groups_comma_ respectively.
E99-1005.txt,66,30 filler items were also included_comma_ in order to ensure subjects produced a wide range of plausibility ratings.
E99-1005.txt,67,These consisted of 30 adjective noun combinations that were not found in a modifier head relation in the BNC_comma_ and were also judged highly implausible by the authors.
E99-1005.txt,69,The experimental paradigm was magnitude estimation ME _comma_ a technique standardly used in psychophysics to measure judgements of sensory stimuli Stevens_comma_ 1975 _comma_ which Bard et al. 1996 and Cowart 1997 have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judgements.
E99-1005.txt,70,The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive.
E99-1005.txt,71,In contrast to the 5 or 7 point scale conventionally used to measure human intuitions_comma_ ME employs an interval scale_comma_ and therefore produces data for which parametric inferential statistics are valid.
E99-1005.txt,72,ME requires subjects to assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional fashion.
E99-1005.txt,73,Subjects are first exposed to a modulus item_comma_ which they assign an arbitrary number.
E99-1005.txt,74,All other stimuli are rated proportional to the modulus.
E99-1005.txt,75,In this way_comma_ each subject can establish their own rating scale_comma_ thus yielding maximally fine graded data and avoiding the known problems with the conventional ordinal scales forlinguistic data Bard et al._comma_ 1996 Cowart_comma_ 1997 Schfitze_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1005.txt,76,In the present experiment_comma_ subjects were presented with adjective noun pairs and were asked to rate the degree of adjective noun fit proportional to a modulus item.
E99-1005.txt,77,The experiment was carried out using WebExp_comma_ a set of Java Classes for administering psycholinguistic studies over the Word Wide Web Keller et al._comma_ 1998 .
E99-1005.txt,78,Subjects first saw a set of instructions that explained the ME technique and included some exampies_comma_ and had to fill in a short questionnaire including basic demographic information.
E99-1005.txt,79,Each subject saw all 120 items used in the experiment 3 x 30 experimental items and 30 fillers .
E99-1005.txt,81,The experiment was completed by 24 unpaid volunteers_comma_ all native speakers of English.
E99-1005.txt,82,Subjects were recruited via postings to local Usenet newsgroups.
E99-1005.txt,83,2.2 Results and Discussion As is standard in magnitude estimation studies_comma_ statistical tests were done using geometric means to normalise the data the geometric mean is the mean of the logarithms of the ratings .
E99-1005.txt,84,An analysis of variance ANOVA indicated that the Frequency Band effect was significant_comma_ in both by subjects and by items analyses FI 2_comma_ 46 79.09_comma_ p .001 F2 2_comma_ 58 19.99_comma_ p .001.
E99-1005.txt,85,The geometric mean of the ratings for adjective noun combinations in the High band was 2.966_comma_ compared to Medium items at 2.660 and Low pairs at 2.271.1 Post hoc Tukey tests indicated that the differences between all pairs of conditions were significant at o .01_comma_ except for the difference between the High and Medium bands in the by items analysis_comma_ which was significant at o .05.
E99-1005.txt,86,These results are perhaps unsurprising pairs that are more familiar are rated as more plausible than combinations that are less familiar.
E99-1005.txt,87,In the next section we explore the linear relationship between plausibility and co occurrence frequency further_comma_ using correlation analysis.
E99-1005.txt,88,3 Corpus based Modelling 3.1 Method We correlated rated plausibility Plaus with the following five corpus based variables 1 logtransformed co occurrence frequency CoocF _comma_ measured as the number of times the adjective noun pair occurs in the BNC 2 log transformed noun frequency NounF _comma_ measured as the number of times the head noun occurs in the BNC 3 conditional probability CondP of the noun given the adjective estimated as shown in equation 2 4 collocational status_comma_ 2 estimated using the log likelihood statistic LLRatio and 5 Resnik s measure of selectional association SelAssoc _comma_ which measures the semantic fit of a particular semantic class c as an argument to a predicate pi.
E99-1005.txt,89,The selectional association between class c and predicate Pi is given in equations 3 and 4 .
E99-1005.txt,90,More specifically_comma_ selectional association represents the contribution of a particular semantic class c to the total quantity of information provided by a predicate about the semantic class of its argument_comma_ when measured as the relative entropy between the prior distriI For comparison_comma_ the filler items had a mean rating of .998.
E99-1005.txt,91,2Mutual information_comma_ though potentially of interest as a measure of collocational status_comma_ was not tested due to its well known property of overemphasising the significance of rare events Church and Hanks_comma_ 1990 .

E99-1045.txt,1,present a status report about an ongoing research project in the field of semi automatic terminology acquisition at the European Academy Bolzano. The main focus will be on encoding a text corpus_comma_ which serves as a basis for applying term extraction programq.
E99-1045.txt,3,Text corpora are valuable resources in all areas dealing with natural language processing in one form or another.
E99-1045.txt,4,Terminology is one of these fields_comma_ where researchers explore domain specific language material to investigate terminological issues.
E99-1045.txt,5,The manual acquisition of terminological data from text material is a very work intensive and error prone task.
E99-1045.txt,6,Recent advances in automatic corpus analysis favored a modern form of terminology acquisition 1 a corpus is a collection of language material in machine readable form and 2 computer programs scan the corpus for terminologically relevant information and generate lists of term candidates which have to be post edited by humans.
E99-1045.txt,7,The following project CATEx adopts this approach.
E99-1045.txt,8,2 The CATEx Project Due to the equal status of the Italian and the German language in South Tyrol_comma_ legal and administrative documents have to be written in both languages.
E99-1045.txt,9,A prerequisite for high quality translations is a consistent and comprehensive bilingual terminology_comma_ which also forms the basis for an independent German legal language which reflects the Italian legislation.
E99-1045.txt,10,The first systematic effort in this direction was initiated a few years ago at the European Academy Bolzano Bozen with the goal to compile an Italian German legal and administrative terminology for South Tyrol.
E99-1045.txt,11,The CATEx C_omputer A_.ssisted Terminology E___ raction project emerged from the need to support and improve_comma_ both qualitatively and quantitatively_comma_ the manual acquisition of terminological data.
E99-1045.txt,12,Thus_comma_ the main objective of CATEx is the development of a computational framework for semi antomatic terminology acquisition_comma_ which consists of four modules a parallel text corpus_comma_ term extraction programs_comma_ a term bank linked to the text corpus_comma_ and a user interface for browsing the corpus and the term bank.
E99-1045.txt,13,3 Building a Parallel Text Corpus Building the text corpus comprises the following tasks corpus design_comma_ preprocessing_comma_ encoding primary data_comma_ and encoding linguistic information.
E99-1045.txt,14,3.1 Corpus Design and Preprocessing Corpus design selects a collection of texts which should be included in the corpus.
E99-1045.txt,15,An important criteria is that the texts represent a realistic model of the language to be studied Bowker_comma_ 1996 .
E99-1045.txt,16,In its current form_comma_ our corpus contains only one sort of texts_comma_ namely the bilingual version of Italian laws such as the Civil Code.
E99-1045.txt,17,A particular feature of our corpus_comma_ which contains both German and Italian translations_comma_ is the structural equivalence of the original text and its translation down to the sentence level_comma_ i.e. each sentence in the original text has a corresponding one in the translation.
E99-1045.txt,18,The corpus is one of the largest special language corpora.
E99-1045.txt,19,It contains ca.
E99-1045.txt,20,5 Mio. words and 35_comma_898 66_comma_934 different Italian German word forms.
E99-1045.txt,21,In the preprocessing phase we correct mainly OCR errors in the raw text material and produce a unified electronic version in such a way as to simplify the programs for consequent annotation.
E99-1045.txt,22,3.2 Encoding Primary Data and Linguistic Annotation Corpus encoding successively enriches the raw text material with explicitly encoded informa275 Proceedings of EACL 99 tion.

E85-1007.txt,1,SAUMER system uses specifications of natural language grammars_comma_ which consist of rules and metarules. to provide a semantic interpretation of an input sentence. The SAUMER Specification Language SSL is a programming language which combin some of the features of generalised phrase structure grammars Gazdar. 1981 . like the correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules_comma_ with definite clause grammars DCC s Pereira and Warren. 1980 to create an executable grammar specification.
E85-1007.txt,2,SSL rules are similar to DCG rules except that they contain a semantic component and may also be left recursive.
E85-1007.txt,3,Metarules are used to generate new rules trom existing rules before any parsing is attempted.
E85-1007.txt,4,A.n implementation is tested which can provide semantic interpretations for sentences containing tepicalisation_comma_ relative clauses_comma_ passivisation_comma_ and questions.
E85-1007.txt,6,The SAUMER system allows the user to specify a grammar for a natural language using rules and metarules rhts grammar can then be u _comma_ed obtain a semantic interpretation of an input sentence.
E85-1007.txt,7,The SAUMER Specification language SSL . which L a variation of definite clause gr s DCGs Pereira and Warren. 1980 . captures some _comma_ff the festures of generaI .ted phrase structure grammar5 GPSGs Gazdax_comma_ 1981 GaTrl r and Pullum. 1982 . like rule schemata_comma_ rule transformations. structured categories_comma_ slash categories_comma_ and the correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules.
E85-1007.txt,8,The semantics currently used in the system are based on Schubert and Pelletiers description in Schubert and Pelletier. 1982 . which adapts the intetmional logic intervretation associated with GPSGs. into a more conventional logical notation 2.
E85-1007.txt,9,THE SEMANTIC LOGICAL NOTATION The logical notation associated with the gr mm r differs from. the usual notation of intensional logic_since it captures some intmtive aspects of natural language_comma_ l Thus. individuals and objects are treated as entities. instead of collections of prope rties_comma_ and actions are n ary relations between these entities.
E85-1007.txt,10,Many of the problems that the intensional notation would solve are handled by allowing ambiguity to be represented in the logical notation.
E85-1007.txt,11,Consequently. as is common in other approaches. e.g.. Gawron. 1982 . much of the processing is deferred to the pragmatic stage.
E85-1007.txt,12,The structure of the lexicon_comma_ and the appearance of post processing markers sharp angle brackets are designed to reflect this ambiguity.
E85-1007.txt,13,The lexicon is organised into two levels.
E85-1007.txt,14,For the semantic interpretation_comma_ the first level gives each word a tentative interpretation.
E85-1007.txt,15,During the pragmatic analysis_comma_ more complete processing information will result in the final interpretation being obtained from the second level of the lexicon.
E85-1007.txt,17,The pragmatic stage will determine if Johal and John3 both refer to the same entry_comma_ say JOHN SMITH1. of the second level of the lexicon_comma_ or if they correspond to different entries_comma_ say JOHN_JONES1 and JOHN_EVANS1.
E85-1007.txt,18,During the pragmatic stage_comma_ the entry of MISS which is referred to by miss2 will be determined if possible .
E85-1007.txt,19,For example_comma_ does John miss John because he has been away for a long time_comma_ or is it because he is a poor shot with a rifle
E85-1007.txt,20,Any interpretation contained in sharp angle brackets. ... . may require post processing.
E85-1007.txt,21,This is apparent in interpretations containing determiners and co ordinators.
E85-1007.txt,23,During pragmatic analysis_comma_ the scope of every and some would presumably be determined.
E85-1007.txt,24,111 should also be noted that. due Io the separabili y of the semantic component from _comma_he grammar rule_comma_ different semantic notation could easily be introduced at long as u app priate .mantic proce in8 rou dne were replaced.
E85-1007.txt,25,The use of SAUMER with an Al adap md version of Mon ue s Intensional Logic is being examined by Fawc It 1984 _comma_ 48 The syntax of this logical notation can be b mmav sed as follows.
E85-1007.txt,26,Sentences and compound predicate formulas are contained within square brackets.
E85-1007.txt,29,2.4 could also be represented as 2.6 want2 kiss3 Mary4 Johnl Johnl However. this notation is usually used for incomplete phrases_comma_ with the square brackets used to obtain a cortvent ona final reading Modified predicate formulas are contained in braces.
E85-1037.txt,1,grammar has been used for AI text generation work in the past_comma_ but the Implementations have tended be ad hoc or inefficient. This paper presents an approach to systemic text generation where AI problem solving techniques are applied directly to an unadulterated systemic grammar.
E85-1037.txt,2,This approach is made possible by a special relationship between systemic grammar and problem solving both are organized primarily as choosing from alternatives.
E85-1037.txt,3,The result is simple_comma_ efficient text generation firmly based in a linguistic theory. .
E85-1037.txt,5,Finally_comma_ the current status of the project will be described_comma_ including sample output generated from a large grammar.
E85-1037.txt,6,THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP I.
E85-1020.txt,1,recognition grammar to supply information to a text to speech system for the synthesis of Italian must rely heavily upon lexical information_comma_ in order to instantiate the appropriate grammatical relations. Italian is an almost free word order language which nonetheless adopts fairly analysable strategies to move major constituents some of these can strongly affect the functioning of the phonotogical component.
E85-1020.txt,2,Two basic claims will be made i. difficulties in associating grammatical functions to constituent structure can be overcome only if Lexical Theory is adopted as a general theoretical framework_comma_ and translated into adequate computational formalisms like ATN or CHART ii. decisions made at previous point affect focus structure construal rules_comma_ which are higher level phonologicaI rules which individuate intonation centre_comma_ build up adequate Intonational Groups and assign pauses to adequate sites_comma_ all being very sensitive to syntactic and semantic i nf ormat i on.
E85-1020.txt,3,We will concentrate on Subject Object function association to c structure in Italian_comma_ and its relation to ATN formalism_comma_ in particular HOLD mechanism and F Gging.
E85-1020.txt,4,Then we will show how syntactic decisions interact with an intonation grammar.
E85-1020.txt,5,We shall also introduce two functional notions STRUCTURE REVERSIBILITY vs. FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY in Italian.
E85-1020.txt,7,In a recent paper we presented Delmonte_comma_ 1983 a phonological processor for Italian which has been implemented at the University of Venice and is used in a text to speech system Delmonte et al._comma_ 1984 for the synthesis of Italian at the Centre of Computational Sonology of the University of Padua.
E85-1020.txt,8,Recently the system has been equipped with a lexicon and a morphological analyser DeImonte et al._comma_ 1985 while the parser is on its way to be built_comma_ which_comma_ since we adopt Lexical Functiona
E85-1020.txt,9,Grammar LFG Bresnan_comma_ 1982 _comma_ as background linguistic theory_comma_ should take the form of a chart_comma_ much in the vein of Kay s 1977_comma_1979_comma_1980 and Kaplan s 1973 functional and general syntactic parsers.
E85-1020.txt,10,At present we are working at the context free grammar and the semantic information to be associated with each lexical entry.
E85-1020.txt,11,As it appears_comma_ Italian is a much more comptex language to be analysed when compared with English_comma_ German and French.
E85-1020.txt,12,As we shall discuss in the paper_comma_ difficulties arise basically because Italian has a relatively much higher freedom in the order of constituents than the above mentioned languages.
E85-1020.txt,13,Also_comma_ the phenomenon of the unexpressed Subject or Null Subject_comma_ makes the working of a parser a much harder task.
E85-1020.txt,14,In this sense_comma_ a chart being unbiased as to what procedure to adopt in the course of the analysis_comma_ will allow 136 the parser to benefit both from tcp down and bottomup procedures in an efficient way plus the obvious back up and parallel processing operations usually required .
E85-1020.txt,15,Besides_comma_ both semantic and grammatical features need to be present throughout the parsing process_comma_ and they will be used to guide the overall parsing strategy.
E85-1020.txt,17,P IVE STRUCTURES AND REVERSIBILITY Assuming that the ultimate goal of a parser ts that of accomplishing the analysis of the input text in terms cf underlying grammatical relations_comma_ we are usually fronted with the task of assigning thematic roles to functional representations mapped onto constituent structures_comma_ as well as defining other non trivial semantic relations including ellipsis_comma_ predication_comma_ coordination_comma_ quantifier negation and modality scope_comma_ head to modifier complement adjunct relations.
E85-1020.txt,18,All these aspects are relevant to a constructional rule of focus structure which addresses directly the informational structure of the text.
E85-1020.txt,19,The intermediate level of grammatical function assignment is in this perspective a relevant level of representation in that it allows the mapping from c structure to O roles in this sense_comma_ it contributes to speed up the recognition procedure.
E85-1020.txt,20,In English_comma_ a completely reversible structure is the following I.
E85-1020.txt,21,The secretary has been killed by the director. in which_comma_ either NP arguments of the predicate KILL can assume the grammatical functions of SUBJect or OBJect of the sentence.
E85-1020.txt,22,On the contrary_comma_ in non reversible passive structures like_comma_ 2.
E85-1020.txt,23,The book has been read by John. only an animate NP argument can be interpreted as SUBJect of the predicate READ thus. inanimate NP arguments can only be interpreted as OBJect of the sentence.
E85-1020.txt,24,It is clear that non reversible passive structures contain additional grammatical cues to speed up comprehension_comma_ but these cues are only available from lexical entries in which selectional restrictions are listed.
E85-1020.txt,25,Semantic features are thus called into question_comma_ and are used to constrain O role assignment in recognition grammars_comma_ in order to derive from functional structure adequate mapping for focus structure.
E85-1020.txt,26,In a more strictly computational perspective_comma_ verb morphology is accessed first for Agreement tests when passive morphology is detected_comma_ this local cue is sufficient to reverse grammatical function assignment carried out so far to the previously analysed NP SUBject_comma_ and assign it Object function.
E85-1020.txt,27,Also transitivity test is necessary not to get entangled with intransitive verbs taking Auxiliary BE.
E85-1020.txt,28,If we regard constituent discontinuities as the major issue to be addressed in the grammatical perspective so far outlined_comma_ passive structures are the canonical case of NP movement in Transformational Grammar TG _comma_ in which traces or gaps are left behind by displaced constituents or within LFG theory of control_comma_ the coindexing performed on f structures between metavariables and empty nodes.
E85-1020.txt,29,In a strictly configurational language like English there does not seem to be such a strong motivation for adopting LFG theoretical framework and introducing the intermediate representation in terms of f structures.
E85-1020.txt,30,It might as well be sufficient to inspect precedence and dominance relations as instantiated by constituent structure and relate them to PSR of a context free grammar in which canonical constituent order is encoded.
E85-1020.txt,31,Since in tensed clauses either a lexical or a pronominal SUBJect must be expressed in preverbal p sition or else a dummy pronoun like there_comma_ it it could be possible to label NPI_comma_ or the one dominated directly by S_comma_ as SUBJect_comma_ whereas postverbal NP2 if present_comma_ as OBJect of the clause_comma_ or the one dominated directly by VP.
E85-1020.txt,32,Unfortunately_comma_ what applies to English or other fixed word order languages_comma_ does not apply to romance languages and in particular to Italian or Spanish_comma_ which have been called Null Subject Languages NSL .
E85-1020.txt,33,One of the distinguishing properties of NSL is that they do not have a canonical position for NP Subject it can either appear in preverbal position as in English_comma_ or i. in postverbal position as a case of Subject Inversion ii. be unexpressed as a case of obviative or extrasentential pronominal_comma_ in tensed clauses iii..be stranded or extraposed_comma_ usually in tensed clauses NP Subject has been moved out of its matrix clause and placed after an embedded clause_comma_ which it controls Subject must be unexpressed or not no intervening lexical NP Subjects are allowed_comma_ however.
E85-1020.txt,34,Before going into the analysis of Italian with more detail_comma_ it is worth while noticing that not always NPI entertains Subject function_comma_ nor NP2 can be interpreted as Object of a finite clause in English_comma_ as the following examples show 3.
E85-1020.txt,35,Computers have been given no consideration whatsoever by linguistis in Italy.
E85-1020.txt,37,Her father Mary hates.
E85-1020.txt,39,The latest book by Calvino sells well.
E85-1020.txt,41,The logical operator .NOT. applies to the parenthesized statement.
E85-1020.txt,43,Geneva is easy to reach from Italy. in which we have cases of fronted NP2 detectable only by having access to NPs inherent semantic features.
E85-1020.txt,44,Thus_comma_ in 3_comma_ it is OBJect2 which has been passivized and not NP2 in 4. we have a topicalized sentence with fronted NP2 in 5.
E85-1020.txt,45,SELL is used in ergative structural configuration_comma_ in which NP2 is raised to Subject the same applies to 6_comma_ a case in which Subject NP would be always omitted subjectless impersonal structures are frequently used in technical and scientific English also 7. is a subjectless structure_comma_ in which tough predicate appears and Object NP2 is raised to Subject position.
E85-1020.txt,46,And now briefly_comma_ NP2 need not always be interpreted as Object of its clause_comma_ as shown below 8.
E85-1020.txt,47,There came the magician with his magic rod.
E85-1020.txt,49,But the rea murderer is the landlord.
E85-1020.txt,51,Mary gave John a beautiful present. where 8. is a presentation sentence with a dummy pronoun there and the Subject NP is in postverbal position 9. is a predication sentence in which something is predicated about the NP Subject the landlord in postverbal position and in 10. the postverbal NP is OBject2 of ditransitive Verbs constructions_comma_ which has undergone dative shift.
E85-1020.txt,53,WH CLAUSES AND FUNCTIONAL REVERSIBILITY In Italian_comma_ reversible structures are also present sometimes obligatorily_comma_ always optionally_comma_ in wh clauses.
E85-1020.txt,55,This is the lion that ate the man that ate the 11. rabbit that ate the carrot.
E85-1020.txt,56,Each embedded clause can only be interpreted as containing an NP argument of EAT assuming Subject function when in preverbal position and Object function when in postverbal position_comma_ the complementizer that relativizing only the left adjacent NP and interpreted as Subject of the following clause.
E85-1020.txt,57,No such interpretation is allowed in 12.
E85-1020.txt,59,This is the man that the lion ate. in which the intervening NP the lion prevents the complementizer from occupying strictly preverbal position_comma_ thus being assigned Object function and as such it is possibile to omit it Subject function being thus assumed by the lion .
E85-1020.txt,60,But in Italian also 13. would have to be allowed_comma_ 13.
E85-1020.txt,61,This is the carrot that ate the rabbit that ate the man that ate the lion.
E85-1020.txt,62,Questa la carota che mangi il coniglio che mangi I uomo che man gi6 il leone .
E85-1020.txt,63,This sentence is absolutely symmetrical semantically to 11._comma_ except for the fact that 13. predicates some thing about a carrot the head whereas 11. predicates the same concept though with a different informational structure_comma_ focus on the lion .
E85-1020.txt,64,Concept ally an operation recalling the passive.
E85-1020.txt,65,Let us now reformulate the two notions that we have introduced so far_comma_ structural reversibility vs. functional reversibility and repeat example I_comma_ I.
E85-1020.txt,66,The secretary has been killed by the director. where what we want to stipulate is the possibility to interchange Subject Object function between the two arguments of the predicate KILL thus_comma_ we could also have_comma_ I.i The director has been killed by the secretary. besides the active forms_comma_ l.ii The director has killed the secretary.
E85-1020.txt,67,1.iii The secretary has killed the director.
E85-1020.txt,68,Structural reversibility involves basically the possibility to use the same constituent order and to freely alternate the instantiation of grammatical functions_comma_ while the underlying grammatical relations intervening between the arguments of the predicate_comma_ change.
E85-1020.txt,69,What is implied is that although both NP arguments of the predicate are eligible to be interpreted as Subject or Object_comma_ only one interpretation wit1 result in each case a grammatically valid configuration results.
E85-1020.txt,70,Thus_comma_ even though thematic roles can be attached interchangeably to either preverbal or postverbal NPs without violating selectional restrictions or semantic compatibility conditions_comma_ it is the final constituent order and structure that decides on the final interpretation.
E85-1020.txt,71,In this sense_comma_ non reversible passives contain cues such that their verb s selectional restrictions permit only a single well formed mapping between NP 138 positions in phrase structure tree and functional structure positions.
E85-1020.txt,72,Other cues wit1 help producing the final interpretation besides structural syntactic ones since either NPI or NP2 in surface c structure won t match their selectional restrictions with the requirements of functional structure mapping_comma_ the parser will compute directly one or the other interpretation disambiguating the resulting sentences on the basis of conditions and tests on the arcs_comma_ rather than on its context free grammar.
E85-1020.txt,73,Thus in 2.
E85-1020.txt,75,The book has been read by John. we are not allowed to build_comma_ 2.i John has been read by the book.
E85-1020.txt,77,ii The book has read John OK in Italian but only_comma_ 2.
E85-1020.txt,78,iii John has read the book. without violating selectional restrictions.
E85-1020.txt,79,Going back to our previous examples_comma_ II. and 3._comma_ what we have then is an example of non reversible functional structures.
E85-1020.txt,80,In this case_comma_ both preverbal and postverbal positions in constituent structure could be freely accessed by the two arguments of the predicate EAT as was the case with example I_comma_ and contrary to what happened with example 2. A. what is blocked in structural reversibility as non reversible passives show is the availability of one of the structural constituent positions to be accessed by both arguments of the predicate B. in functional reversibility as non reversible wh clauses show it is the availability of one of the arguments of the predicate to be assigned any grammatical function_comma_ that is blocked.
E85-1020.txt,81,In B. constituent order is irrelevant_comma_ and it is crucial in A. B. is typical of NSL_comma_ while A. is typical of configurational languages in which grammatical functions can be associated in a reliable way to fixed or canonical constituent orders.
E85-1020.txt,82,In Italian_comma_ no such canonical order exist_comma_ essentially because both preverbal and postverbal constituent positions constitute an unmarked case for Subject Object functiona assignment.
E85-1020.txt,83,The consequences of this analysis of talian in terms of functional reversibility wit1 be explored when analysing functional reversible structures.
E85-1020.txt,84,For now it suffices to remark that a parser is unable to rely on constituent order alone to produce reasonable predictions on the underlying grammatical relations it will be obliged to make available semantic information in all cases of tensed active clauses.
E85-1020.txt,87,Tough Predicates tough A T PRED  TOUGH T SCOMP  T SCOMP TOPIC  T SUBJ S for NP V P TSUBJ  T T TOPIC If v 2 NP 3.
E85-1020.txt,92,Why this formalism should be relevant in the description of non strictly configurational languages like Italian it is intuitively apparent from the examples we reported above.
E85-1020.txt,93,The coupling of annotated PSRs with Lexical Forms in which granenatical functions are specified as arguments of the predicate is enormously ad vantageous in view of parsing.
E85-1020.txt,94,In fact_comma_ this mechanism will allow the parser to reduce drastically parallel structure analyses since derivated structures like Subject Inversion and Topicalization will eventually be assigned their grammatical relations in a straightforward manner_comma_ by simply looking up seIecttonal restrictions associated to each argument position in f structure.

E85-1020.txt,96,26. there is no duplication of lexical entries with NPs c structure positions apart from permutations under I.
E85-1020.txt,97,As we said previousIy this would be treated as a contrastive emphatic structure when opposite f structure mappings have to be recovered otherwise NPI and NP2 would be assigned their canonical f structure.
E85-1020.txt,98,If the parser is allowed to produce all possible analyses with the remaining permutations_comma_ a great number of duplicated structural configurations will result as far as f structure is concerned.
E85-1020.txt,99,This is not a desirable result_comma_ however_comma_ given that LFG formalism a11ows the parser to restrict its hypotheses to just those cases permitted by Italian grammar.
E85-1020.txt,100,In particular_comma_ it is simply a case that examples 5.
E85-1020.txt,103,8. are dtsambiguated by the presence of a resumptive pronoun marking gender differences between the two arguments of the predicate.
E85-1020.txt,104,Whenever no such information is available_comma_ the parser will again duplicate analyses both arguments belong to the same gender.
E85-1020.txt,105,Other approaches have been proposed see Stock_comma_ 1982 Cappelli et al._comma_ 1984 disregarding exclusive ly semantic approaches Schank Abelson_comma_ 1977 for Italian which put forward global hypothesis for the availability of a semantic space Stock in which to manipulate syntactic structures so far analysed or a syntactic space Cappelli et el. limited to the Left Context_comma_ in which to perform a small set of .
E85-1030.txt,1,are nowadays used by varied and diverse users_comma_ many of whom are unfamiliar with the workings of a computer_comma_ but who_comma_ nevertheless_comma_ want to use those databases more easily. Rising to meet this demand_comma_ authors are developing a Japanese language interface_comma_ called KID_comma_ as a database front end system.
E85-1030.txt,2,KID incorporates a world model representing application and database knowledge to help make databases easier to use.
E85-1030.txt,3,KID has the following features I parser extendability and robustness_comma_ 2 independence from the application domain_comma_ 3 ease of knowledge editing_comma_ 4 independence from the database.
E85-1030.txt,4,This paper focuses on the first three features.
E85-1030.txt,5,KID has already been applied to the fields of housing_comma_ sales_comma_ and drug testing_comma_ thus confirming its transportability and practicality. .
E85-1030.txt,6,KID Knowledge based Interface to Databases is a Japanese language database interface Izumida_comma_ 84 .
E85-1030.txt,7,KID has the following four features.
E85-1030.txt,8,Extendability and robustness Natural language sentences employ a wide variety of expressions.
E85-1030.txt,9,A parser must always be extended to understand new sentences.
E85-1030.txt,10,A parser which can understand one set of sentences is often incapable of understanding another set of sentences.
E85-1030.txt,11,In KID_comma_ parsing rules are grouped into packets and the parsing mechanism is simple_comma_ thus making KID highly extendable.
E85-1030.txt,12,The system must be robust_comma_ in order to handle conversational sentences_comma_ which often contain errors and ellipses.
E85-1030.txt,13,To interpret these ill formed sentences_comma_ semantic interpretation must play a leading role.
E85-1030.txt,14,KID has an integrated knowledge base called the world model.
E85-1030.txt,15,The world model represents the semantic model of the domain of the discourse in an object oriented manner.
E85-1030.txt,16,Several systems e.g._comma_ Ginsparg_comma_ 83 use a semantic model to interpret ill formed sentences_comma_ but the use of the semantic model is unclear.
E85-1030.txt,17,We have made the semantic interpretation rules clear according to the structure of the world model and syntactic information of the input sentences.
E85-1030.txt,18,This helps the parsing of ill formed sentences.
E85-1030.txt,19,Independence from the application domain The system must be easily adaptable to different applications.
E85-1030.txt,20,The domain dependent knowledge must be separate from the domainindependent knowledge.
E85-1030.txt,21,In many systems e.g._comma_ Waltz_comma_ 78 and Hendrix_comma_ 78 _comma_ the domain dependent knowledge is embedded within the parsing rules_comma_ thus reducing the system s transportability.
E85-1030.txt,22,In KID_comma_ the domain dependent knowledge is integrated into the world model separately_comma_ therefore giving KID high transportability.
E85-1030.txt,23,Ease of knowledge editing The world model contains various kinds of knowledge_comma_ and the editing of this knowledge must be easy to accommodate various levels of users.
E85-1030.txt,24,KID provides users with the world model editor_comma_ this having a separate user interface for each user level.
E85-1030.txt,25,The world model editor makes the customization and extension of the KID system easy.
E85-1030.txt,26,Independence from the database The system must be able handle changes in the database system and schema easily.
E85-1030.txt,27,In TEAM Gross_comma_ 83 _comma_ the schema information is separate_comma_ but the user must be familiar with the database schema such as files and fields.
E85-1030.txt,28,In KID_comma_ the mapping information between the model of the domain and the database schema is described in the world model_comma_ so the user does not have to worry about any changes in the database schema.
E85-1030.txt,29,Knowledge of the query language of a database system is represented separately as production rules.
E85-1030.txt,30,Thus_comma_ the user only has to change these rules if there are changes in the database system.
E85-1030.txt,31,In this paper we will focus on the first three features of KID.
E85-1030.txt,32,Firstly_comma_ we will explain the world model_comma_ then the overall structure of the KID_comma_ the morphological analyzer required to process Japanese language sentences _comma_ the modelbased parser_comma_ semantic interpretation and the flow of the parsing process_comma_ knowledge for customizing KID and_comma_ lastly_comma_ the evaluation of KID and its results.
E85-1030.txt,33,WORLD NODEL The world model represents the user s image of the application domain.
E85-1030.txt,34,The user s image does not match the database schema_comma_ because the database schema reflects the storage structure of the data and the performance consideration of the database system.
E85-1030.txt,35,The world model represents the user s image as classes and relationships between them.
E85-1030.txt,37,Part of the world model for sales.
E85-1030.txt,38,A class is represented as an object in the object oriented programming sense Bobrow_comma_ 81 _comma_ which describes a thing or event in the domain.
E85-1030.txt,39,There are only two types of relationship attribute relationship and super sub relationship.
E85-1030.txt,40,This model matches the user s image and is very simple_comma_ so design and editing of the model is easy.
E85-1030.txt,41,Figure I shows the part of the world model for a sales domain.
E85-1030.txt,42,The commodity class has two attribute classes_comma_ commodity s name and fixed price.
E85-1030.txt,43,The beer and whisky classes are subclasses of the commodity class and inherit its attributes.
E85-1030.txt,44,Figure 2 shows a part of the definition of the sales class.
E85-1030.txt,45,The internal representation of a class object is a frame expression.
E85-1030.txt,46,A slot represents a relationship to another class using a class facet and mapping information to the database schema using a Sstorage facet.
E85-1030.txt,47,The value of a Sstorage facet denotes the class name which has mapping information.
E85-1030.txt,48,The sales class has four attribute classes RETAILER_comma_ COMMODITY_comma_ SALES RICE_comma_ and SALES QUANTITY.
E85-1030.txt,49,An object may also include the method for handling data within it.
E85-1030.txt,50,The system allows the user to define lexical information in the world model.
E85-1030.txt,51,For example_comma_ the noun commodity corresponds to the commodity class.
E85-1030.txt,52,The verb sell and the noun sale both correspond to the sales class.
E85-1030.txt,53,The verb locate SALES RETAILER class RETAILER storage SALES RETAILER STORAGE COMMODITY class COMMODITY storage SALES COMMODITY STORAGE PRICE class SALES PRICE Sstorage SALES PRICE STORAGE QUANTITY class SALESZQUANTI TY storage SALES_QUANTITY_STORAGE Figure 2.
E85-1030.txt,54,Internal representation of a class. corresponds to the arc between the relation and location classes.
E85-1030.txt,55,Lexical information is physically stored in the word dictionary.
E85-1030.txt,56,The dictionary is represented as a table of the relational database system.
E85-1030.txt,57,Figure 3 shows part of the dictionary.
E85-1030.txt,58,The dictionary consists of a headword_comma_ an identifier_comma_ a part of speech_comma_ parsing information and other fields.
E85-1030.txt,59,The correspondence to the world model is represented in the OBJECT feature of the PARSE field.
E85-1030.txt,60,The verb also has its case frame information in the PARSE field.
E85-1030.txt,61,All the information relating to a specific domain is stored in the world model_comma_ so the user need only create the world model to customize KID to a specific application.
E85-1030.txt,62,This results in transportability of the system.

E85-1030.txt,67,SYSTEM CONFIGURATION KID is the front end system of the database management system_comma_ the configuration being shown in Figure 4.
E85-1030.txt,68,The user enters a query via Japanese word processing terminal.
E85-1030.txt,69,Since a Japaneselanguage sentence is not separated into words_comma_ the morphological analyzer segments the sentence to get the list of words_comma_ using the word dictionary.
E85-1030.txt,70,The model based parser analyzes the word list_comma_ and semantically interprets it_comma_ using the world model as a basis.
E85-1030.txt,71,The result is the meaning structure consisting of the parsed tree and the relevant part of the world model representing the meaning of the input query.
E85-1030.txt,72,The retriever generates the Japanese language paraphrase from the meaning structure and outputs it to the user terminal for confirmation.
E85-1030.txt,73,Then_comma_ the retriever translates the meaning structure into the query language of the target database management system and executes it.
E85-1030.txt,74,The result is displayed on the user terminal.
E85-1030.txt,75,The world model is managed by the modeling system_comma_ REALM REAL world Modeling system _comma_ and is edited by the world model editor.
E85-1030.txt,76,MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYZER A Japanese language sentence is not separated into words.
E85-1030.txt,77,The system must segment a sentence into its component words.
E85-1030.txt,78,The morphological 207 His behavior was childish.    his behavior was I childish Lo indication of life Figure 5.
E85-1030.txt,79,An example of morphological analysis. analyzer performs this segmentation.
E85-1030.txt,80,KID selects the segmentation candidate with the least number of bunsetsu .
E85-1030.txt,81,We believe this method to be the best method for segmenting a Japanese language sentence Yoshimura_comma_ 83 .
E85-1030.txt,82,This method uses a breadth first search of a candidate word graph.
E85-1030.txt,83,Since many candidate words are generated by this method_comma_ the performance of the segmentation is not so good.
E85-1030.txt,84,We use the optimum graph search algorithm_comma_ called A Nilssen_comma_ 80 _comma_ to search the candidate word graph.
E85-1030.txt,85,Figure 5 shows an example of morphological analysis.
E85-1030.txt,86,This sentence has three possible segmentations.
E85-1030.txt,87,The first line is the correct segmentation_comma_ having the least number of bunsetsu .
E85-1030.txt,88,The algorithm A estimates the number of bunsetsu in the whole sentence at each node of the candidate word graph_comma_ and selects the next search path.
E85-1030.txt,89,This method eliminates useless searching of the candidate graph.
E85-1030.txt,90,In Figure 5_comma_ the circled numbers denote the sequence of the graph search.
E85-1030.txt,91,The morphological analyzer segments a sentence using connection information for each word.
E85-1030.txt,92,The connection information depends on the part of speech.
E85-1030.txt,93,Detailed classification of words leads to correct segmentation.
E85-1030.txt,94,However_comma_ it is difficult for an end user perform this kind of classification.
E85-1030.txt,95,Thus_comma_ we classify words into two categories content words and function words.
E85-1030.txt,96,Content words are nouns_comma_ verbs_comma_ adjectives_comma_ and adverbs_comma_ which depend on the application.
E85-1030.txt,97,They are classified roughly.
E85-1030.txt,98,Function words include auxiliaries_comma_ conjunctions_comma_ and so on_comma_ which are independent of the domain.
E85-1030.txt,99,They are classified in detail.
E85-1030.txt,100,It is easy for the user to roughly classify content words.
E85-1030.txt,101,This morphological analyzer segments sentences precisely and efficiently_comma_ and generates a word list.
E85-1030.txt,102,This word list is then passed to the model based parser.
E85-1030.txt,103,MODEL BASED PARSER In its first phase the parser generates bunsetsu from the word list.
E85-1030.txt,104,The parser syntactically analyzes the relationship between these bunsetsu .
E85-1030.txt,105,At the same time_comma_ the parser semantically checks and interprets the relationships_comma_ based on the world model.
E85-1030.txt,106,Bunsetsu sequences of a Japanese language sentence are relatively arbitrary.
E85-1030.txt,107,And conversational sentences may include errors and ellipses_comma_ therefore the parser must be robust_comma_ in order to deal with these ill formed sentences.
E85-1030.txt,108,These factors suggest that semantic interpretation should play an important role in the parser.
E85-1030.txt,109,The basic rules of semantic interpretation are the identification rule and the connection rule.
E85-1030.txt,110,These rules check the relationship between the classes which correspond to the bunsetsu and interpret the meaning of the unified bunsetsu .
E85-1030.txt,111,The identification rule corresponds to a super sub relationship.
E85-1030.txt,112,If two classes_comma_ corresponding to i I i sales price is 2000 yen Figure 6.
E85-1030.txt,113,An example of the identification rule.
E85-1030.txt,114,i retaiier name Figure 7.
E85-1030.txt,115,An example of the connection rule.
E85-1030.txt,116,208 two phrases_comma_ are connected by a super sub relationship_comma_ this rule selects the subclass as the meaning of the unified phrase_comma_ because the subclass has a more specific and restricted meaning than the super class.
E85-1030.txt,117,Figure 6 shows an example of the identification rule.
E85-1030.txt,118,In this example_comma_ the phrase sales price corresponds to the sales price class_comma_ and 2000 yen corresponds to the price class.
E85-1030.txt,119,The identification rule selects the sales price class as the unified meaning.
E85-1030.txt,120,The connection rule corresponds to an attribute relationship.
E85-1030.txt,121,If two classes are connected by an attribute relationship_comma_ this rule selects the root class of the relation as the meaning of the unified class_comma_ because the root class clarifies the semantic position of the leaf class in the world model.
E85-1030.txt,122,Figure 7 shows an example of the connection rule.
E85-1030.txt,123,In this example_comma_ the phrase retailer corresponds to the retailer class_comma_ and name corresponds to the name class.
E85-1030.txt,124,The connection rule selects the retailer class as the unified meaning.
E85-1030.txt,125,Bunsetsu generation Identification Connection Figure 8.
E85-1030.txt,127,Figure 8 shows the parsing process of the model based parser.
E85-1030.txt,128,In each process_comma_ input sentences are scanned from left to right.
E85-1030.txt,129,In the first phase_comma_ bunsetsu are generated from the word list.
E85-1030.txt,130,At the same time the parser attaches the object which is instanciated from the corresponding class to each bunsetsu The following identification and connection phases perform semantic interpretation using these instance objects_comma_ and determines the relationship between phrases.
E85-1030.txt,131,The identification process and connection process are executed repeatedly until all the relationship between phrases have been determined.
E85-1030.txt,132,The identification process has priority over the connection process_comma_ because a super sub relationship represents a same concept generalization hierarchy and has stronger connectivity than an attribute relationship_comma_ the latter representing a property relation between different concepts.
E85-1030.txt,133,This parsing mechanism is very simple_comma_ allowing the user to expand each process easily.
E85-1030.txt,134,Each process consists of a number of production rules_comma_ which are grouped into packets according to the relevant syntactic patterns.
E85-1030.txt,135,Each packet has an execution priority according to the syntactic connectivity of each pattern.
E85-1030.txt,136,Thus the identification or addition of the rules are localized in the packet concerned with the modification.
E85-1030.txt,137,This simple parsing mechanism and the modular construction of the parsing rules contribute to the expandability of the parser.
E85-1030.txt,138,Figures 9 and 10 show an example of parsing.
E85-1030.txt,139,This query means What is the name of the retailer in Geneva who sells commodity A .
E85-1030.txt,140,The morphological analyzer segments the sentence_comma_ and the model based parser generates the phrases in the parentheses.
E85-1030.txt,141,The identification process is not applied to these phrases_comma_ because there is no super sub relationship between them.
E85-1030.txt,142,Next_comma_ the model based parser applies the connection process.
E85-1030.txt,143,The phrase Geneva can modify the phrase commodity A syntactically_comma_ but not semantically_comma_ because the corresponding classes_comma_ Location and Commodity _comma_ do not have an attribute relationship.
E85-1030.txt,144,The phrase commodity A can modify the phrase to sell both semantically and Geneva commodity A to sell retailer name S Sales C Sales M Sales Commodity CS Retailer C Sales M Sales Commodity C name Retailer Figure 9.
E85-1030.txt,145,An example of parsing I .
E85-1030.txt,146,209 geneva commodity A to sell retailer name C Sales  M Sales Commodity C name . Retailer Location S Name C Sales M Sales Commodity C name Retailer Location R name Figure 10.
E85-1030.txt,147,An example of parsing 2 . syntactically_comma_ because the classes Commodity and Sales have an attribute relationship.
E85-1030.txt,148,In this case_comma_ the predicate connection rule is applied_comma_ generating the unified phrase_comma_ node I.
E85-1030.txt,149,The parser uses these three kinds of objects to check the connectivity.
E85-1030.txt,150,The syntactic object S represents the syntactic center of the unified phrase.
E85-1030.txt,151,In the Japanese language the last phrase of the unified phrase is syntactically dominant.
E85-1030.txt,152,The conceptual object represents the semantic center of the unified phrase_comma_ and is determined by the identification and connection rule.
E85-1030.txt,153,The meaning objects M represent the meaning of the unified phrase using the sub network of the world model.
E85-1030.txt,154,The predicate connection rule determines the sales class to be the conceptual object of node I_comma_ because the sales class is the root class of the attribute relationship.
E85-1030.txt,155,The meaning objects are Sales  Commodity  Commodity name.
E85-1030.txt,156,The predicate connection rule also generates noun phrase node 2 and the S_comma_C_comma_and M of the node is determined as described in Figure 9.
E85-1030.txt,157,Next_comma_ the noun phrase connection rule is applied.
E85-1030.txt,158,This rule is applied to a syntactic pattern such as a noun phrase with a postposition no followed by a noun phrase with any kind of postposition.
E85-1030.txt,159,The phrase Geneva and the unified phrase 3 are unified to node 3 by the noun phrase connection rule see Figure 10 .
E85-1030.txt,160,This rule also generates node 4.
E85-1030.txt,161,The meaning of this sentence is that of node 4.
E85-1030.txt,162,Errors or ellipses of postposition_comma_ such as no or ga _comma_ are handled by packets which deal with the syntactic pattern.
E85-1030.txt,163,On the other hand_comma_ ellipses are handled by the special packets which deal with non unified phrases based on the world model.
E85-1030.txt,164,These special packets have a lower priority than the standard packets.
E85-1030.txt,165,Different levels of robustness can be achieved by using the suitable packet for dealing with errors or ellipses CUSTORIZATION To customize the KID system to a specific application domain_comma_ the user has to perform several domain dependent tasks.
E85-1030.txt,166,First_comma_ the user makes a class network for the domain either from queries_comma_ which we call a top down approach_comma_ or from the database schema_comma_ a bottom up approach.
E85-1030.txt,167,Then_comma_ the user assigns words to the classes or attributes of the class network.
E85-1030.txt,168,Lastly_comma_ the user describes mapping information between classes and the database schema within the classes.
E85-1030.txt,169,The world model editor supports these customization processes.
E85-1030.txt,170,The world model editor has three levels of user interface_comma_ in order to assist various users in editing the world model see Figure 11 .
E85-1030.txt,171,The first level is a construction description level_comma_ in which the user makes a structure of a class network.
E85-1030.txt,172,The second level is a word assignment level_comma_ in which the user assigns words to classes or attributes.
E85-1030.txt,173,These two levels are provided for end users.
E85-1030.txt,174,The third level is a class or word contents description level.
E85-1030.txt,175,This level is provided for more sophisticated users_comma_ who understand the internal knowledge representation.
E85-1030.txt,176,The world model editor enables users to navigate any of the interface levels.
E85-1030.txt,177,Various users can edit the knowledge_comma_ according to their own particular view.
E85-1030.txt,178,Thus_comma_ knowledge base editing is made easier.
E85-1030.txt,179,EVALUATION We have applied KID to three different applications housing_comma_ sales_comma_ and new drug tests.
E85-1030.txt,180,Figure 12 shows a result of an evaluation of KID.
E85-1030.txt,181,The target domain is a new drug test.
E85-1030.txt,182,We prepared 400 sentences for the evaluation.
E85-1030.txt,183,In a little less than a month_comma_ 91 of the sentences had been accepted.
E85-1030.txt,184,We decided a sentence is accepted_comma_ if the sentence is correctly analyzed and the correct data is retrieved from the database.
E85-1030.txt,185,We divided the 4OO sentences into four groups and performed a blind test and a full capability test for each group_comma_ in stages.
E85-1030.txt,186,In the blind test_comma_ sentences are tested without changing any knowledge of the system.
E85-1030.txt,187,In the full capability test_comma_ we make all possible extensions or modifications to accept the sentences.
E85-1030.txt,188,The acceptance ratio of the blind test is improving_comma_ so we believe KID will soon become available for practical use.
E85-1030.txt,191,The world model editor.
E85-1030.txt,193,Evaluation of KID.
E85-1030.txt,194,98 95 211 CONCLUSIOHS In this paper_comma_ the three features of the Japanese language interface KID were described.
E85-1030.txt,195,KID has both a simple mechanism of parsing and modularized grammar rules_comma_ so the parser is highly extendable.
E85-1030.txt,196,The semantic interpretation has clear principles based on the structure of the world model and syntactic information of the input sentence.
E85-1030.txt,197,Thus_comma_ the different levels of robustness are achieved by the adequate portion of the parser for dealing with the errors or ellipses.
E85-1030.txt,198,The world model integrates the domaindependent knowledge separately.
E85-1030.txt,199,The user only has to customize the world model to a specific application.
E85-1030.txt,200,This customization is supported by the world model editor which provides various levels of user interfaces to make the world model editing easy for various users.
E85-1030.txt,201,KID is now implemented as a front end system for the relational database system Makinouchi_comma_ 83 .
E85-1030.txt,202,KID is implemented in Utilisp Chikayama_comma_ 81 _comma_ a dialect of Lisp.
E85-1030.txt,203,The morphological analyzer is 0.7 ksteps_comma_ the model based parser is 2.3 ksteps_comma_ and retriever is 2.2 ksteps.
E85-1030.txt,204,The grammatical rule is 2.7 kstepe written in a rule description language_comma_ and is made up of 70 packets.
E85-1030.txt,205,KID uses several tools and utilities.
E85-1030.txt,206,The modeling system REALM is 2 ksteps_comma_ the world model editor is 1.3 ksteps_comma_ the window system is 1.7 ksteps_comma_ and the knowledge based programming system_comma_ Minerva_comma_ is 3.5 ksteps.
E85-1030.txt,207,We have several plans for future development.
E85-1030.txt,208,We will expand the system to accept not only retrieval sentences but also insertion_comma_ deletion_comma_ update_comma_ statistical analysis_comma_ and graphic operation.
E85-1030.txt,209,The parser coverage will be extended to accept wider expressions_comma_ including parallel phrases and sentences.
E85-1030.txt,210,ACKNONLEDGERENTS To Mr.
E85-1030.txt,211,Tatsuya Hayashi_comma_ Manager of the Software Laboratory we express our gratitude for giving us an opportunity to make these studies. .
E85-1003.txt,1,the intention of indicating some temporal event theoretic characteristics of distributive clauses_comma_ a generalisation is made over distributives and clauses marked for iterative aspect two kinds of semantic phenomena which have normally been confined to separate theoretical domains. It is shown that in particular_comma_ both give rise to an inferential set construction problem.
E85-1003.txt,2,An informal outline is given of what might constitute such a generalisation.
E85-1003.txt,3,The generalisation is proposed intially on grounds of prima facie plausibility_comma_ but its ultimate defensibility and explanatory value will depend on the validity of its consequence_comma_ that distributive clauses entail a multiplicity of temporal entities or events.
E85-1003.txt,4,This proposal is considered with respect to two types of discourse phenomena anaphoric reference to event entities_comma_ and temporal binding.
E85-1003.txt,5,These provide further support for making the generalisation_comma_ clarify its nature and indicate in what respect the entailment claim can be true of distributives.
E85-1003.txt,6,The set construction problem is of practical importance for computational models of natural language interaction_comma_ and since the concept of iterated action is central to planning_comma_ the generalisation across iteration and distributives_comma_ along with the observations about their nature_comma_ have interesting implications for work in this area.
E85-1003.txt,8,DISTRIBUTIVES First_comma_ three points about the body of phenomena called distributives .
E85-1003.txt,9,These are taken to be relatively uncontroversial_comma_ and are simply assumed in the rest of this paper.
E85-1003.txt,10,i Examples a and b in I illustrate the distributive collective distinction.
E85-1003.txt,11,Essentially_comma_ sentences containing at least one plural or universally quantified NP_comma_ the denotation of which might be regarded as a set_comma_ can either be read in terms of the individual members of this set as in la _comma_ or given a group reading in terms of the set as a whole as in Ib .
E85-1003.txt,12,1 a The three girls each had a pizza. dist b The three girls shared a pizza. coll ii It is distributive readings which give rise to the possibility of quantifier scope ambiguities including interpretations which involve dependency relations between the NPs in the sentence.
E85-1003.txt,13,Dependency interpretations in turn allow inferential set construction Consider example 2 .
E85-1003.txt,14,2 Mary gave each boy book a ...and told him to look after it. b They took them into the garden to read.
E85-1003.txt,15,On the most common reading of the distributive clause Mary gave each boy book_comma_ there is a dependency relation between the two object NPs such that book is in the scope of each boy and the interpretation of the former is relative to that of the latter.
E85-1003.txt,16,2b illustrates one type of anaphoric relation which distributive clauses may participate in plural pronouns and definite NPs are used to refer to implicit sets of entities which instantiate variables introduced in distributive clauses by just such singular indefinite NPs in the scope of distributive NPs.
E85-1003.txt,17,So in 2b the underlined NP they refers to the set of books such that Mary gave each one to some boy.
E85-1003.txt,18,As Webber 1979_comma_ 1983 has pointed out_comma_ this anaphoric possibility represents a practical problem for computational accounts of discourse_comma_ since a mechanism is required for constructing as a 16 discourse entity a set with the correct description_comma_ on the basis of the semantic representation of the initial distributive sentence containing the singular indefinite NP. temporal binding.
E85-1003.txt,19,These support the hypothesised generalisation and tell us something about the temporal or eventtheoretical structure of both distributives and iteratives.
E85-1003.txt,20,Notice that singular anaphora as in 2a is also possible the singular anaphor indicates the maintenance of a rhetorical mode of generalisation through singularisation _comma_ which is established by the initial distributive sentence.
E85-1003.txt,21,The pronoun it acts as a placeholder_comma_ signifying a representative member of the set of books such that Mary gave each one to some boy_comma_ and it has the status of a bound variable Such pronouns cannot be taken to refer and I describe the contrast between them and the plural anaphors as being that the plural ones represent a referential or extensional cashing out of the initial semantic value.
E85-1003.txt,22,iii Sentence 2b also indicates the possibility of using a plural pronoun th y to refer to some relevant set of boys in contrast to 2a where the singular_comma_ bound variable pronoun him is used .
E85-1003.txt,23,However_comma_ it is not really necessary to propose a second algorithm to construct such sets because the initial_comma_ syntactically singular distributive NPs_comma_ such as eac h bow_comma_ are arguably almost always themselves referential and anaphoric _comma_ ust in the sense that the range of quantification is restricted by context.
E85-1003.txt,25,It can be paraphrased with the partitive expression each of the bows.
E85-1003.txt,26,My intention in this paper is to explore a temporal_comma_ event oriented perspective on distributives.
E85-1003.txt,27,The question at issue is What are the consequences for the temporal or eventtheoretical analysis of a clause_comma_ of its being distributive in the sense defined
E85-1003.txt,28,First I indicate similarities between distributives and clauses marked with iterative aspect.
E85-1003.txt,29,I then make certain observations which apply to both distributives and iteratives_comma_ concerning two kinds of discourse phenomena definite NP anaphora to event entities_comma_ and one I aspectual I parameter I I The observations made in this paper are confined to the past tense and to telic or bounded situation types Mourelatos_comma_ 1981 .
E85-1003.txt,31,ITERATIVES The following are examples iterative clauses in English of 3 a Each day Mary wrote a letter to her sister. b Every time John went abroad he bought a souvenir.
E85-1003.txt,32,c Vesuvius erupted three times.
E85-1003.txt,33,Iterativity is an aspectual parameter which in English is marked mainly adverbially_comma_ with the presence of what are called frequency adverbials or temporal quantifiers underlined in the examples .
E85-1003.txt,34,Iterative markers on a clause indicate the repetition of the event described in the clause_comma_ and also provide information about the frequency of repetition.
E85-1003.txt,35,The key requirement is couched in terms of an entailment condition iteratives entail that there was more than one occasion on each of which an event of type E occurred_comma_ where occasion is defined as spatiotemporal location.
E85-1003.txt,36,So there is a necessary requirement of seauentiality that the events in question occurred on different occasions_comma_ in sequence.
E85-1003.txt,38,GENERALISATION On the basis of the descriptions given in sections I and 2 we can argue for a generalisation over distributives and iteratives such as is represented in Figure I cf. Forsyth_comma_ 1970 154 .
E85-1003.txt,40,Generalisation over distributives and iteratives.
E85-1003.txt,41,17 There are a number of intuitive arguments for the prima facie plausibility of such a generalisation_comma_ two of which will be considered here.
E85-1003.txt,42,First_comma_ it is clear that from one point of view_comma_ distributives and iteratives differ just in the nature of what is quantified over distributives_comma_ where the marking of repetition is normally on the NP_comma_ involve quantification over individuals_comma_ while the temporal adverbial expressions in the iterative examples are normally taken to involve quantification over times or events.
E85-1003.txt,43,That is_comma_ the iterative markers can be seen as introducing distributive quantification.
E85-1003.txt,44,Secondly_comma_ perhaps the strongest argument for generalisation is that inferential set construction occurs with iteratives.
E85-1003.txt,45,Some iteratives_comma_ like distributives_comma_ contain indefinite NPs whose instantiations may vary across the repetition of the event. sQuvenir in example 4 _comma_ and a letter in example 5 are just such NPs.
E85-1003.txt,46,4 EverYtime John went abroad he bought A souvenir. a Sometimes it was a silver teaspoon_comma_ sometimes an antique vase. b They just lie around the house_comma_ cluttering it up.
E85-1003.txt,47,5 Each day_comma_ Mary wrote letter to her sister. a It was usually ten pages long. b They were chatty letters.
E85-1003.txt,48,The solution to the set construction problem should if possible be a general one_comma_ covering both distributive and iterative cases.
E85-1003.txt,49,The ultimate defensibility_comma_ and explanatory value_comma_ of making such a generalisation will depend on whether it accurately reflects the facts about the temporal or event theoretical structure of distributive clauses.
E85-1003.txt,50,It was said that are customarily defined as entailing a seauence o_ f events_comma_ each associated with a different occasion or spatiotemporal location.
E85-1003.txt,51,A generalisation of the kind envisaged would suggest that distributives might be regarded as having such an entailment as well_comma_ and the question we have to consider is whether this is so.
E85-1003.txt,52,Certainly_comma_ some distributives clearly involve multiple occasions_comma_ that is_comma_ spatiotemporal locations.
E85-1003.txt,53,For example 6a _comma_ where it s one and the same book which is lent_comma_ and 6b .
E85-1003.txt,54,6 a Mary lent each boy the book. b John visited each of his aunts.
E85-1003.txt,55,On the other hand_comma_ take an example like 2 above Mary gave each boy 9 o This could easily describe a single occasion of giving_comma_ taking place once only.
E85-1003.txt,56,One could even imagine Mary handing a book to each of two boys simultaneously_comma_ with either hand.
E85-1003.txt,57,Or consider 7 _comma_ on the interpretation where it was the same message and I did it on one occasion.
E85-1003.txt,58,Iteratives such as these manifest the same scope ambiguities as distributives and are open to the same mechanism of set construction which as we saw operates in distributive clauses on the NPs which are distributed over.
E85-1003.txt,59,So in 4 _comma_  is in the scope of a restricted universal quantification over times_comma_ and the sentence in question could be followed by b where they refers to the set of souvenirs such that John bought each one on some trip abroad.
E85-1003.txt,61,Intuition is clearly not enough_comma_ and in sections 4 and 5 we shall consider evidence from the discourse phenomena mentioned earlier_comma_ but first_comma_ what would constitute such a generalisation over iteratives and distributives a generalisation which would indicate their similarities and differences_comma_ and provide a way in which the entailment of multiple temporal entities events could be said to be true of distributives
E85-1003.txt,65,Figure 2 is the skeleton of such templates or case specifications _comma_ which will be fleshed out for individual clauses.
E85-1003.txt,66,Distributive and iterative markers alike then contribute the following information first_comma_ that there are multiple instantiations of this pattern rather than a single instantiation and_comma_ in conjunction with other grammatical features of the clause_comma_ they provide information about which of these elements remain constant across such instantiations and which are variable.
E85-1003.txt,67,For example_comma_ take the sentence Each day_comma_ Mary wrote letter to her sister Figure 3 .
E85-1003.txt,68,This specifies a event type which as indicated by R is repeatedly instantiated.
E85-1003.txt,69,Two of the participants_comma_ Mary and her sister_comma_ remain constant across these repetitions.
E85-1003.txt,70,The other participant_comma_ the letter_comma_ varies and will be instantiated by a possibly different entity on each occasion of repetition.
E85-1003.txt,71,There is also variation in the spatiotemporal element.
E85-1003.txt,74,Case specification for Each day_comma_ Mary wrote letter to her sister. distributives_comma_ at least one of the participant elements must vary the one introduced by the distributive NP and in addition so may other elements_comma_ including spatiotemporal location_comma_ if they are in a dependency relation with this NP.
E85-1003.txt,75,If no other participant element is in a dependency relation with the distributive NP_comma_ that is if all other participant elements are held constant_comma_ then variation in spatiotemporal location will entail_comma_ as in example 6a .
E85-1003.txt,76,Which elements vary tells us which inferential sets to construct.
E85-1003.txt,77,The similarities between the informal proposal which has just been sketched and Lewis s 1975 account of temporal quantifiers in terms of cases will be obvious.
E85-1003.txt,79,He argues that iterative markers involve quantification over cases rather than over times or events.
E85-1003.txt,80,My proposal could be interpreted as a claim that we can extend some version of a case analysis to include distributives these_comma_ too_comma_ would be taken to involve quantification over cases.
E85-1003.txt,81,Quantification over times or participants would then represent particular ways of realising the multiple instantiation of the case.
E85-1003.txt,82,The advantages of an account such as this are that it allows generalisation over a wide variety of phenomena_comma_ including numerous ways of marking iteration or distribution on the clause_comma_ and that it provides an appropriate level of description to be referred to in accounting for discourse anaphoric relations.
E85-1003.txt,83,The question of the individuation of events is a controversial one_comma_ and the terms event and event type have so far been used rather loosely.
E85-1003.txt,84,Suppose we first follow Mourelatos 1981 in making a distinction between events and the spatiotemporal locations with which they are associated_comma_ and secondly_comma_ suggest that 19 events should be regarded as particular instantiations of case specifications of the type described.
E85-1003.txt,85,Then iteratives entail a multiplicity of cases events spatiotemporal locations which are in some isomorphic relationship _comma_ whereas distributives likewise entail a multiplicity of cases events_comma_ but merely allow the possibility of multiple spatiotemporal locations i.e._comma_ events and spatiotemporal locations may not be in an isomorphic relationship as we shall see_comma_ in the case of any particular distributive_comma_ this question may be resolved by following anaphoric reference. visit signifies a representative event of the type described 10 John visited each of his maiden aunts_comma_ but the visit didn t make him popular with any of them.
E85-1003.txt,86,A second type of singular anaphora occurs_comma_ as in 11 in this case the anaphoric pronoun that appears to refer to the whole distributive episode_comma_ of John visiting each aunt_comma_ described in the preceding clause.
E85-1003.txt,88,ANAPHORIC REFERENCE TO EVENTS 8 John visited each of his great aunts. a The visits were much appreciated by the old ladies. b These were a source of torment to him.
E85-1003.txt,89,9 Everytime John went to Namibia he visited an old friend. a He found the visits distressing. b He was upset on these Q casions_comma_ Examples 8 and 9 indicate that after a distributive or iterative clause_comma_ speakers can refer using a plural definite NP_comma_ to a set of entities which are something like events or occasions and which appear to correspond to the distributive or iterated situation of the preceding clause.
E85-1003.txt,90,Note thetwo types of example a and b in the first_comma_ the common noun head of the anaphoric expression is a nominalisation of the verb in the antecedent sentence such NPs are normally taken to refer to event entities in the second the noun is a much more general one.
E85-1003.txt,91,Both kinds of example appear to represent a phenomenon of the same type as the inferential set construction described in section I it is as if the initial distributive or iterative clause introduces an event variable and the anaphoric NPs represent a referential extensional cashing out of this.
E85-1003.txt,92,Continuing the parallel with anaphoric reference to nominally introduced entities_comma_ example 10 shows that with respect to event entities too_comma_ singular anaphoric NPs occur which are of the bound variable type.
E85-1003.txt,93,Thus in 10 the 11 John visited each of his aunts.
E85-1003.txt,94,Tha___ t was a thoughtful thing to do.
E85-1003.txt,95,Finally_comma_ examples 12 and 13 show that_comma_ although plural definite NPs can be used to access the set of events or occasions resulting from distributive iterative clauses as in 8 and 9 _comma_ plural pronouns cannot.
E85-1003.txt,96,In 12 they and hem can only be interpreted with reference to the aunts compare the same sentences with the pronouns replaced by the NP the visits.
E85-1003.txt,97,Explanation of this_comma_ which there is not space to elaborate here_comma_ must take account of the obvious fact that a requirement of nominalisation is involved.
E85-1003.txt,98,Meanwhile the important point to note is the clear distinction between the distribution of definite NP and pronominal anaphors.
E85-1003.txt,99,12 John visited each of his aunts. a They were a dismal failure. b He had a good time on all of them.
E85-1003.txt,100,c Each of them went well.
E85-1003.txt,101,13 John flew to Paris twice. a He enjoyed both trips. b the enjoyed both of them.
E85-1003.txt,102,Example 11 shows that sinaular pronominal reference does occur_comma_ but this seeming inconsistency may be explained in terms of the nature of the entity being referred to the plural NPs seem to refer to events whereas the singular ones refer to facts or propositions in the sense of the distinction argued for in Vendler 1967 .
E85-1003.txt,104,TEMPORAL BINDING PHENOMENA First it is necessary to review some claims of theories of temporal reference.
E85-1003.txt,105,Consider the following example 14 When John made the cake_comma_ he broke the oven.
E85-1003.txt,106,Whe _comma_ like other temporal connectives such as before and after_comma_ indicates a particular relationship between the two clauses it connects normally such relationships are considered to consist in specification of the relative ordering in time of the two events describe by these clauses.
E85-1003.txt,107,The basic claim_comma_ then_comma_ is that such connectives give a specification of a kind of temporal binding between the two clauses such that the reference time of one is dependent on that of the other.
E85-1003.txt,108,This claim is independent of the particular nature of the ordering or binding hypothesised.
E85-1003.txt,109,This idea is clearly on a par with claims that certain temporal phenomena should be understood on analogy with nominal anaphora_comma_ for example that the past tense morpheme should be taken to refer to a time_comma_ and to receive its reference either from some antecedent tense morpheme in the text_comma_ or from some adverbial expression_comma_ or deictically. Kamp 1979 _comma_ Hinrichs 1982 and Partee 1984 _comma_ who subscribe to a discourse theory of temporal ordering relations_comma_ argue that in narrative discourse the reference time of any main clause will be dependent on that of the preceding clause that is_comma_ that just the same kinds of temporal binding dependencies occur at the level of discourse_comma_ between clauses which are syntactically independent as well as between those which are linked by temporal connectives.
E85-1003.txt,110,With this background_comma_ we can consider cl uses which involve iteration_comma_ marked by temporal quantification_comma_ in addition to temporal connection of the type just described.
E85-1003.txt,111,For example 15 .
E85-1003.txt,112,15 When Max left the office_comma_ he always turned the lights off.
E85-1003.txt,113,It seems that such sentences said with respect to the phenomena examined in this section this wil be dealt with in forthcoming work. constitute a binding or dependency_comma_ between two clauses describing distinct types of event_comma_ which puts a condition on the pairwise mapping of instantiations of such events.
E85-1003.txt,114,Thus_comma_ in this case_comma_ every event of Max leaving the office is said to have been paired with at least one event of his turning the lights off.
E85-1003.txt,115,This kind of dependency relation seems to be exactly parallel to that which holds between the distributive NP each qirl and the indefinite NP book in Mary qave each book.
E85-1003.txt,116,In terms of the schema in Figures 2 and 3_comma_ binding is of the temporal variable t of clause one_comma_ and v the t v of clause two.
E85-1003.txt,117,Notice that the when clause restricts the range of the iterative quantifier always in the following clause.
E85-1003.txt,118,Examples like 15 are a special case of temporal quantification in that the condition on the range of quantification is explicitly stated in the subordinate clause.
E85-1003.txt,119,But it is true in general that temporal quantifiers like alwaTs or each time do not range over all of time_comma_ but over some contextually fixed interval.
E85-1003.txt,120,They thus conform to the claim made in section I that distributive NPs normally have their range of quantification restricted to some otherwise specified witness set The reference time t of Figure 3 represents this kind of witness set.
E85-1003.txt,121,The main point to be made in this section is that distributive clauses_comma_ with no explicit temporal quantification_comma_ can also act as sources for temporal binding_comma_ and restrict the range of subsequent temporal quantification_comma_ in just the same way that the iterati e clauses do.
E85-1003.txt,122,Hence we find examples like 16 and 17 .
E85-1003.txt,123,16 Mary gave each boy a book.
E85-1003.txt,124,Sometimes the boy thanked her_comma_ but more often he did not.
E85-1003.txt,125,17 Harry invited each of his relatives to stay.
E85-1003.txt,126,On each occasion he bought in enough food to feed an army.
E85-1003.txt,127,Here_comma_ the range of the quantifier phrases sometimes_comma_ mote often and on each is restricted by the set of events determined by the preceding distributive clause that is_comma_ by something like the set of instantiations of the case specification_comma_ perhaps more specifically_comma_ instantiations of the temporal variable t .
E85-1003.txt,129,22_comma_ nominal anaphora which were outlined in section 1 of the paper.
E85-1003.txt,130,The a examples in 19 _comma_ 20 and 21 in each case represent something like maintenance of the binding we are still specifying the type of the event sequence which is iterated_comma_ and all the clauses in the sequence have the same t reference time or witness set.
E85-1003.txt,131,In the  examples_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ the description of the iterated event is finished there is a discourse level division between the initial distributive iterative sentence and sentence b _comma_ representing the end of the rhetorical mode of generalisationthrough singularisation_comma_ and closure of the interval t .
E85-1003.txt,132,One indication of this is that any p onouns occurring in the b sentence_comma_ and anaphoric to distributive NPs or their dependent expressions in the first sentence_comma_ will necessarily be plural.
E85-1003.txt,133,The use of a plural NP_comma_ which as I have said represents referential cashing out _comma_ indicates that the iterated sequence is over and we can now assume its completion and move on.
E85-1003.txt,134,In contrast_comma_ in the a sentences anaphoric pronouns referring to entities which were introduced by the nominals in the distributive iterative sentence_comma_ are normally singular.
E85-1003.txt,136,CONCLUSIONS The anaphoric examples in section 4 show that both distributive and iterative clauses enable subsequent reference to sets of cases events using a definite NP.
E85-1003.txt,137,This is clearly parallel to the possibility of using a plural anaphoric NP to make reference to some set of individuals such as books _comma_ on the basis of an original singular NP . .
E85-1003.txt,138,It would seem to be desirable to account for both kinds in terms of the same mechanism of set construction .
E85-1003.txt,139,The anaphoric examples also indicate a qualitative difference between the distribution of definite NP and pronominal anaphora_comma_ and show that there is discourse anaphoric access not just to the subparts of the distributed or iterated situation_comma_ but also to something like the whole distributive quantification_comma_ which may be an entity of a different kind.
E85-1003.txt,140,The temporal binding phenomena of section 5 give a different type of evidence for the explanatory value of making a generalisation of the kind described.
E85-1003.txt,141,The observations in this section also show that_comma_ whereas past tense clauses describing a single situation have a reference time with some specific temporal referent_comma_ distributive and iterative clauses seem to require nested reference times _comma_ with temporal ordering relations definable at two levels.
E85-1003.txt,142,The Kamp Hinrichs Partee account needs to be modified before it is able to incorporate these phenomena.
E85-1003.txt,143,I ve said that the set construction problem is of practical importance for computational models of natural language interaction.
E85-1003.txt,144,In addition_comma_ the concept of iterated action is important to planning_comma_ so that a generalisation across distributives and iteratives plus what has been said about their temporal nature should have interesting implications in this area.
E85-1003.txt,145,If iteration is handled computationally by setting up a loop which embodies the instruction to repeat an action under certain conditions_comma_ then distributives may be handled the same way.
E85-1003.txt,146,Distributive and iterative interpretations may hold over stretches of discourse_comma_ the delimitation of which is relevant to the interpretation of temporal connectives_comma_ and as we saw with examples 19 to 21 _comma_ in some cases anaphoric phenomena may give clues about this delimitation_comma_ that _comma_is_comma_ indicating when to turn off the iterative loop.
E85-1003.txt,147,The delimitation of such discourse chunks corresponds to the delimitation of the extent of influence of the t or witness set _comma_ and so anaphor in following sentences may allow us to close off this interval.

E85-1040.txt,1,dialog systems are now developing from question answering systems toward advising systems. This includes discussed here_comma_ but see Jameson_comma_ Wahlster 1982 .
E85-1040.txt,2,The second part of this paper presents user modelling with respect to a dialog strategy which selects and verbalizes the appropriate speech act of recommendation. structuring dialog understanding and generating a wider range of speech acts than simply information request and answer user modelling User modelling in HAM ANS is closely connected to dialog structure and dialog strategy.
E85-1040.txt,3,In advising the user_comma_ the system generates and verbalizes speech acts.
E85-1040.txt,4,The choice of the speech act is guided by the user profile and the dialog strategy of the system. .
E85-1040.txt,5,The HAMburg Application oriented Natural language System HAM ANS which has been developed for 3 years is now accomplished.
E85-1040.txt,6,We could perform numerous dialogs with the system thus determining the advantages and shortcomings of our approach Hoeppner at al. 984 .
E85-1040.txt,7,So now the time has come to show the open problems and what we have learned as did the EUFID group when they accomplished their system Templeton_comma_ Burger 1983 .
E85-1040.txt,8,This paper does not evaluate the overall HAM ANS but is restricted to the aspect of dialog structuring and user modelling.
E85-1040.txt,9,Dialog structure is represented at two levels the outline of the dialog is explicitly represented by a top evel routine_comma_ embedded sub dialogs are a result of the processing strategy of HAM ANS. The overall dialog structure is utilized for determining the appropriate degree of detail of the referential knowledge for a particular dialog phase. The embedded sub dialogs refer to other knowledge sources than the referential knowledge. In the first part of this paper dialog structuring in HAM ANS is described. Handling of dialog phenomena as ellipsis and anaphora is not DIALOG STRUCTURE In one of its three applications HAM ANS plays the role of a hotel clerk who advises the user in selecting a suitable room. The task of advising can be seen here as a comparison of the demands made on an object by the client and the advisor s knowledge about available objects_comma_ performed in order to determine the suitability of an object for the client. Dialogs between hotel clerks at the reception and the becoming hotel guest are usually short and stereotyped but offer some flexibility as well because the ruests do not establish a homogeneous group. With recourse to this restricted dialog type we modelled the outline of the dialog. Dialog structure is not represented in terms of some actions the user might want to perform as did Grosz 1977 _comma_ Allen 1979 _comma_ Litman_comma_Allen 1984 nor in terms of information goals of the user as did Pollack 1984 _comma_ but we represent and use knowledge about a dialog type.
E85-1040.txt,10,For formal dialogs in a well defined comunication setting this is possible.
E85-1040.txt,11,For a practical application the dialog phases and steps should be empirically determined.
E85-1040.txt,12,We do not consider the hotel reservation situation an example for real application.
E85-1040.txt,13,We just wanted to show the feasibility of recurring to linguistic knowledge about types of texts or dialogs.

E85-1040.txt,15,Features of informal man mancommunication as_comma_ e.g._comma_ narratives and roledefining utterances of dialog partners were excluded from the model of the dialog.
E85-1040.txt,16,Manmachine interaction is seen as formal as opposed to informal communication_comma_ and there is no way of redefining it as personal talk.
E85-1040.txt,17,The outline of the dialog is a structure at three different levels there are three dialog phases_comma_ each consisting of several dialog steps see Fig. l .
E85-1040.txt,18,Each dialog step can be performed by several dialog acts. The work on HAM ANS has been supported by the BMFT Bundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologic under contract 08it15038.
E85-1040.txt,20,If the user denies the questioning phase is continued.
E85-1040.txt,21,The advantages of fully utilizing knowledge about the dialog type are the reduction of complexity_comma_ i.e. the system does not have to recognize the dialog step_comma_ realistic response time because no additional processing has to be done for planning the dialog_comma_ and the explicit representation of the dialog structure.
E85-1040.txt,22,The declarative representation of dialog structure allows for modelling different degrees of detail of the world knowledge attached to the dialog phases.
E85-1040.txt,23,Views of the domain We believe that the degree of detail of referential knowledge is constituing a dialog phase.

E85-1012.txt,4,I. . .
E85-1012.txt,5,The capability to learn is one of the central features of intelligent behavior_comma_ and learning constitutes one of the current hot topics in artificial intelligence Michalski_comma_ Carbonnell_comma_ and Mitchell_comma_ 1983 .
E85-1012.txt,6,Much of the work on this field has dealt with induction_comma_ rule discovery_comma_ and learning by analogy or from examples_comma_ whereas much less effort has been dedicated to building systems able to learn by processing natural language texts.
E85-1012.txt,7,As Norton 1983 308 remarked_comma_ the general agreed upon assumption was that such a capability is not learning at all but merely  the conversion of knowledge from one representation to another .
E85-1012.txt,8,ACquiring new Knowledge via prose comprehension is_comma_ on the contrary_comma_ a complex activity which relies on understanding the linguistic input_comma_ storing the extracted information in memory_comma_ and integrating it with prior knowledge for effective use.
E85-1012.txt,9,As far as psychology is concerned_comma_ learning from written texts has often aroused the interest of cognitive and educational psychologists.
E85-1012.txt,10,Due to the limitations of the experimental approach which has been generally adopted_comma_ however_comma_ this topic has seldom been dealt with in its entirety.
E85-1012.txt,11,Lots of experiments have been carried on focusing on restricted arguments and specific phenomena whose explanations too often look suspiciously ad hoc.
E85-1012.txt,12,Unfortunately_comma_ those who addressed the full problem of meaningful verbal learning e.g. Ausubel_comma_ 1963 stated their theories so vaguely that it is almost impossible to express them in form of effective procedures and to implement them in computer programs.
E85-1012.txt,13,In the last few years the situation has changed and several projects Frey_comma_ Reyle_comma_ and Rohrer_comma_ 1983 Haas and Hendrix_comma_ 1983 Nishida_comma_ Kosaka_comma_ and Doshita_comma_ 1983 Norton_comma_ 1983 are now devoted to develop computer systems which could automatically extract information from written texts.
E85-1012.txt,14,Practical applications_comma_ besides theoretical interest_comma_ motivates this kind of research.
E85-1012.txt,15,In the expert system technology_comma_ for example_comma_ the process of discovering what is known to the experts of the field in which the program must perform requires tedious and costly interactions between the knowledge engineer and those experts.
E85-1012.txt,16,Automatic acquisition of knowledge by text understanding could represent a way to partially reduce the labor and fatigue involved in the transfer of expertise.
E85-1012.txt,17,The paper presents the general design and the first results of a research project whose long term goal is to develop and implement ALICE_comma_ an experimental system capable of augmenting its knowledge base by processing natural language texts and reasoning about them.
E85-1012.txt,18,Particular attention is given to the simulative aspects of the project.
E85-1012.txt,19,ALICE an acronym for Automatic Learning and Inference Computerized Engine is an attempt to model the cognitive processes that occur in humans when they learn a series of descriptive texts and reason about what they have learned.
E85-1012.txt,20,Comparisons with what is Known about human cognitive behavior are therefore explicitly taken into account in devising algorithms and data structures for the system.
E85-1012.txt,21,In the next section a general overview of the system is provided with the description of its specifics_comma_ basic methodologies_comma_ and generar architecture.
E85-1012.txt,22,The third section briefly describes the parser used in 79 ALICE_comma_ and how parsing is performed is illustrated in section four by following the analysis of a small sample text.
E85-1012.txt,23,Section five concludes the paper by giving a summary of the main ideas and some implementational details.
E85-1012.txt,25,ALICE A GENERAL OVERVIEW 2.
E85-1012.txt,26,I Specifics The main goal of the ALICE project is to examine how it is possible to build a machine which could_comma_ in a psychologically plausible way_comma_ learn new facts about a given domain by analysing natural language texts.
E85-1012.txt,27,ALICE can operate according to two different ways in learning mode and in consult mode.
E85-1012.txt,28,In learning mode ALICE is given in input a series of sentences in Italian forming simple introductory scientific passages.
E85-1012.txt,29,The domains chosen for the initial experimentation are elementary chemistry and electronics.
E85-1012.txt,30,The system understands the input texts and integrates the information extracted from them with that previously stored in its knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,31,For checking purposes the system outputs the sentence by sentence internal representation that is added to the knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,32,When working in consult mode_comma_ ALICE receives in input a question concerning the processed texts and returns the portion of the knowledge base containing the information needed to answer it.
E85-1012.txt,33,It should be noted that the system has no generation capabilities it does not output natural language sentences but only the internal representation of a small part of its knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,34,Another limitation of the system is that it can deal with questions only in a piece meal fashion.
E85-1012.txt,35,ALICE_comma_ in other words_comma_ lacks the dialogic capabilities needed to build a graceful man machine interface.
E85-1012.txt,36,User modelling_comma_ mixed initiative dialogue_comma_ co operative behavior etc. are simply outside the scope of the project.
E85-1012.txt,37,ALICE cannot obviously understand all the sentences that is possible to express in a given language.
E85-1012.txt,38,Unrestricted language comprehension is currently beyond our capabilities.
E85-1012.txt,39,As work in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics has taught us_comma_ it is very difficult to build programs that could successfully cope with linguistic materials.
E85-1012.txt,40,This is due to the fact that language is essentially a knowledge based process.
E85-1012.txt,41,In understanding natural language it is necessary to make a heavy reliance on world knowledge even to do very elementary operations disambiguate the meaning of a word_comma_ identify an anaphoric referent_comma_ capture the syntactic structure of a sentence.
E85-1012.txt,42,Paradoxically it has been said that one cannot learn anythingt unless s he almost knows it already.
E85-1012.txt,43,In order to avoid the danger of being stuck in a loop i.e._comma_ text understanding requires a rich stock of knowledge_comma_ but in order to acquire such a Knowledge it is necessary to understand textual material _comma_ the passages given in input_comma_ derived from programmed instruction textbooks_comma_ were kept relatively simple from the linguistic point of view.
E85-1012.txt,44,As an automatic knowledge acquisition system_comma_ ALICE differs from other natural language processors in that_comma_ by definition_comma_ its knowledge base is incomplete.
E85-1012.txt,45,This means that_comma_ at the beginning_comma_ not only its conceptual coverage but also its linguistic particularly lexical capabilities are quite limited.
E85-1012.txt,46,A great deal of work in learning a new subject is constituted by mastering new concepts and the terminology needed to refer to them.
E85-1012.txt,47,When the system encounters a word for which it has no definition in its dictionary_comma_ it should be able to learn this new word and guess at its meaning.
E85-1012.txt,48,Doing this can be easy when the new word is explicitly defined in the text but it can require non trivial inferential processes if the new word is implicitly introduced by relating it with other concepts whose meaning is already known.
E85-1012.txt,49,ALICE comes preprogrammed with a fixed set of rules enabling it to cover a small subset of Italian.
E85-1012.txt,50,It also comes with seed concepts and a seed vocabulary which are to be extended as the system learns about the new domain.
E85-1012.txt,51,ALICE acquires new knowledge by integrating the information extracted from the input texts with that previously stored in its knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,52,As a result of its operation_comma_ ALICE s conceptual coverage increases with the number of passages in a given domain which have been understood.
E85-1012.txt,53,ALICE is thus capable of understanding more complex texts since its encyclopedic knowledge can be brought to be bear in the comprehension process.
E85-1012.txt,54,A necessary prerequisite to this accomplishment is that parsing input texts should not be considered as a separate activity but it must be integrated with the remaining operations performed by the system.
E85-1012.txt,55,2.2 Knowledge Representation Methods An important point in the design of every artificial intelligence program is constituted by deciding how to represent knowledge.
E85-1012.txt,56,A good formalism should be able to express all the knowledge needed in a given application domain_comma_ and should facilitate the process of acquiring new information.
E85-1012.txt,57,ALICE adopts a clear distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge.
E85-1012.txt,58,This is a critical_comma_ and not at all obvious_comma_ choice.
E85-1012.txt,59,80 Norton 1983 _comma_ for example_comma_ adopts as the target representational formalism for his system statements in the PROLOG language which can be interpreted both declaratively and procedurally.
E85-1012.txt,60,Erom a psychological point of view_comma_ however_comma_ there are strong reasons for maintaining the distinction between these two kinds of knowledge Anderson_comma_ 1976 116 119 the declarative knowledge seems possessed in all or none manner whereas it is possible to possess procedural knowledge only partially the declarative knowledge is acquired suddenly by being told whereas the procedural knowledge can be acquired only gradually by performing a skit1 it is possible to communicate verbally the declarative but not the procedural knowledge.
E85-1012.txt,61,In ALICE the declarative knowledge is constituted by the information that the system is able to derive from the texts.
E85-1012.txt,62,It is represented through the BLR propositional language Fum_comma_ Guida_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1984 _comma_ a formalism derived by augmenting the representation used in psychological setting by Kintsch Kintsch_comma_ 1974 Kintsch and van Dijk_comma_ 1978 with the features necessary to make it computationally tractable.
E85-1012.txt,63,The procedural knowledge represents the knowledge necessary to the system operation.
E85-1012.txt,64,It is expressed in form of production systems which operate on the propositions contained in the knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,65,There are several motives that make the use of productions systems particularly interesting to model human cognitive processing.
E85-1012.txt,66,Productions systems provide a unifying formalism to deal with the different kinds of processes that occur in knowledge acquisition through text comprehension.
E85-1012.txt,67,Moreover_comma_ they are especially suitable to support the strategic approach on which the system operation is grounded.
E85-1012.txt,68,2.3 Basic Methodologies The strategic approach to text understanding_comma_ and reasoning with linguistic materials_comma_ can be fruitfully contrasted with the algorithmic one.
E85-1012.txt,69,Examples of the algorithmic approach in the field of natural language processing can be found_comma_ for example_comma_ in the use of grammars which produce structural descriptions of sentences by syntactic parsing rules.
E85-1012.txt,70,In the field of inferential processes this approach is represented by theorem provers based on resolution mechanisms which_comma_ granting that a theorem could be derived from a given set of axioms_comma_ are able to discover its proof.
E85-1012.txt,71,These processes can be complex_comma_ long and tedious but they guarantee success as long as the algorithm is correct and it is correctly applied.
E85-1012.txt,72,The strategic approach does not guarantee a priori success.
E85-1012.txt,73,It is based on a set of heuristics_comma_ expressed as production rules_comma_ which constitute some working hypotheses about how to discover the correct meaning of a fragment of text or the way by which a certain inference could be drawn.
E85-1012.txt,74,Strategies are rules of thumb which are applied to analyse_comma_ understand_comma_ and reason about natural language texts.
E85-1012.txt,75,Humans differ in their cognitive functioning according to the amount and the kind of strategies they have at their disposal_comma_ and according to the way in which these strategies are applied.
E85-1012.txt,76,Experimental evidence for the strategic approach has been gathered since a long time.
E85-1012.txt,77,Clark and Clark 1977 reviewed some of the strategies utilized in sentence comprehension van DIjk and Kintsch 1983 wrote a whole book to examine the strategies employed in discourse understanding_comma_ and Anderson 1976 examined the strategies his subjects adopted to perform formal deductions in syllogistic reasoning tasks.
E85-1012.txt,78,The strategic approach is inextricably linked with other assumptions concerning text understanding and learning.
E85-1012.txt,79,The goal of the human understanding activity and of the systems aimed at modelling human cognitive processing is not the discovery of the syntactic structure of a sentence but of its meaning.
E85-1012.txt,80,This does not mean that syntax is of no use in text understanding.
E85-1012.txt,81,Syntactic information_comma_ however_comma_ constitutes only one among the different knowledge sources utilized to capture the meaning of a piece of text_comma_ and syntactic analysis represents neither a separate phase nor a prerequisite for comprehension activity.
E85-1012.txt,82,The construction of the meaning representation takes place more or less at the same time of the data input.
E85-1012.txt,83,Humans do not wait until an entire sentence is uttered before they begin to interpret what has been said.
E85-1012.txt,84,They may have expectations about what sentences look like_comma_ and these expectations may facilitate the understanding process.
E85-1012.txt,85,As words are being received people try to build a possible semantic interpretation for them.
E85-1012.txt,86,Additional words are used to confirm or disconfirm that interpretation.
E85-1012.txt,87,In the latter case_comma_ a new interpretation is build and it is checked against the new data.
E85-1012.txt,88,There is no fixed order between input data and their interpretation interpretations may be data driven or they may be constructed in absence of external evidence and only later be matched with data.
E85-1012.txt,89,Language understanding is a multifaceted activity and several kinds of competence are needed to perform it.
E85-1012.txt,90,ALICE relies on a series of specialists which co operate in performing the variuos operations i.e._comma_ parsing_comma_ inferencing_comma_ memory management which are required to acquire new knowledge by text comprehension.
E85-1012.txt,91,81 2.3 General Architecture ALICE is composed see fig. I of the following modules the parser the inference engine the memory manager the monitor which can utilize_comma_ in order to perform their activity_comma_ two data structures the knowledge base and the working memory.
E85-1012.txt,92,The knowledge base can be considered as the long term memory of the system.
E85-1012.txt,93,Information extracted from the texts received in input is represented in declarative form in such a structure.
E85-1012.txt,94,The knowledge base is constituted by a huge amount of BLR propositions linked to form a cohesion graph.
E85-1012.txt,95,Unlike semantic networks_comma_ a cohesion graph only indicates the fact that some concepts and propositions of the knowledge base are connected all the information concerning the kind of relationship existing among them is to be found in the BLR propositions.
E85-1012.txt,96,The knowledge base is concept indexed it can be accessed through one or more concepts that become thus activated.
E85-1012.txt,97,From these concepts activation spreads_comma_ through the the different kinds of arcs irrespective of their direction o to the propositions in which they are contained and to other concepts connected to them.
E85-1012.txt,98,This mechanism of spreading activation_comma_ similar to that described in Quillian 1969 _comma_ Collins and Loftus 1975 and Anderson 1976 _comma_ makes it possible to selectively access the information contained in the knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,99,The working m morv represents the short term memory of the system.
E85-1012.txt,100,It is a memory of limited capacity which represents the portion of the knowledge base which can be accessed and operated upon by the different productions.
E85-1012.txt,101,To utilize a piece of knowledge_comma_ it is necessary to activate it_comma_ i.e. it must be present in the working memory.
E85-1012.txt,102,The working memory stores generally only the information connected to the sentence that is currently being processed plus some information necessary to understand the sentence information needed to draw an inference_comma_ to establish coreferential links and coherence_comma_ to exactly quantify an expression etc. .
E85-1012.txt,103,The system modules do not communicate directly with each other but they can exchange information only through the working memory which serves as a blackboard for the whole system.
E85-1012.txt,104,There are some important differences_comma_ however_comma_ between the use of It l PARSER WORKING MEMORY l l ENGINE MANAGER MONITOR 11 KNOWLEDGE BASE Fig.l The General Architecture 82 the working memory in ALICE and other blackboard based system like HEARSAY If Lesser and Herman_comma_ 1977 see also Cullingford_comma_ 1981 .
E85-1012.txt,105,First_comma_ in HEARSAY If each specialist expresses its hypotheses on the blackboard in its own representation language.
E85-1012.txt,106,In ALICE_comma_ BLR is the common language for representing all the information provided by the specialists.
E85-1012.txt,107,Second_comma_ the control of the specialist activity is decentralized in HEARSAY while in ALICE the control information is explicitly present rather than diffused through a large database.
E85-1012.txt,108,The activity of the different modules does not depend only from the content of the blackboard but is directly controlled by the monitor which disciplines the operation of the different modules.
E85-1012.txt,109,The parser is devoted to translate a natural language expression a sentence to be processed in learning mode or a query to be answered in consult mode into the BLR representation.
E85-1012.txt,110,This activity is performed through the collaboration of a number of parsing specialists which are supposed to be competent in each of the several domains involved in language understanding_comma_ and to cover the wide spectrum of different capabilities required to build up the text representation.
E85-1012.txt,111,Parsing is strictly integrated with the other operations performed by the system inferencing and memory management i.e._comma_ retrieving old information to be utilized in text understanding_comma_ and integrating new information in the knowledge base .
E85-1012.txt,112,The inference engine is the module devoted to perform the inferences required to understand a piece of text or to answer a question.
E85-1012.txt,113,Its task is to go beyond the information given and to discover new information to be supplied to the system.
E85-1012.txt,114,Different kinds of inferences are performed by this module propositional_comma_ pragmatic_comma_ and formal deductions.
E85-1012.txt,115,Propositional inferences are based on linguistic features of predicates.
E85-1012.txt,116,They are necessarily true and can be directly derived from the semantic content of the propositions.
E85-1012.txt,117,Pragmatic inferences are derived from knowledge sources beyond the explicit_comma_ linguistic input.
E85-1012.txt,118,They are not necessarily true but only plausible.
E85-1012.txt,119,Pragmatic inferences_comma_ however_comma_ are often drawn in processing natural language to establish_comma_ for example_comma_ the coherence of seemingly separate segments of texts_comma_ to understand referential expressions_comma_ to build bridging implicatures _comma_ etc. Formal deductions are often required to understand scientific passages.
E85-1012.txt,120,Humans_comma_ however_comma_ are different from theorem provers in that they are neither sound nor complete inferential engines.
E85-1012.txt,121,They sometimes reason in contrast with the dictates of logic they do not draw every possible consequence from a set of premises but only those that appear sensible and interesting finally_comma_ they perform in a reasonably efficient manner.
E85-1012.txt,122,The inference engine module is an attempt to simulate human inferential processes in dealing with scientific texts.
E85-1012.txt,123,The memory manager is the only module which interacts directly with the knowledge base.
E85-1012.txt,124,It is devoted to retrieve some information necessary to the system operation_comma_ to match the information extracted from the current text with that contained in the knowledge base_comma_ to upgrade it by integrating the new knowledge.
E85-1012.txt,125,The memory manager implements a multiple access_comma_ parallel search assumption concerning the way the knowledge based is searched for information.
E85-1012.txt,126,This means that the system memory can be accessed from all the concepts contained in the linguistic input and that the concepts spread their activation in parallel among the links departing from them.
E85-1012.txt,127,When the minimum length path between two concepts is discovered the propositions standing on it are returned as being relevant to the current input.
E85-1012.txt,128,Through the memory manager it is possible to simulate certain process that are Known to occur in human memory_comma_ for example propositional fan and interference effects.
E85-1012.txt,130,TOWARDS A MENTAL PARSER In accordance with the general simulative approach of the ALICEproject_comma_ the main criterion to follow in designing and evaluating a parser is that of how well its operation corresponds to the way humans understand language.
E85-1012.txt,131,Unfortunately_comma_ in spite of lots of psycholinguistic studies_comma_ we are far from knowing how the mind works.
E85-1012.txt,132,Experimental evidence_comma_ at most_comma_ can help us to put some constraints on the specifics of a mental parser .
E85-1012.txt,133,It is apparent_comma_ for example_comma_ that human parsing does not occur entirely top down or bottom up but uses some combination of these strategies.
E85-1012.txt,134,It is almost certain_comma_ moreover_comma_ that humans do not use backtracking or looking ahead in order to cope with nondeterminism Johnson Laird_comma_ 1983 .
E85-1012.txt,135,The most important preliminary question to be dealt with in the design of a mental parser_comma_ however_comma_ is that of what mechanisms people use in understanding.
E85-1012.txt,136,Linguists hold that people rely on formal rules and that they have implicit knowledge of the grammar they apply in analysing a sentence.
E85-1012.txt,137,Some of the rule systems that linguists use to parse sentences are implausible as psychological dels the resources they demand and the computations involved simply exceed the human processing limitations see_comma_ for instance Anderson s critique of ATN formalisms Anderson_comma_ 83 1976 .
E85-1012.txt,138,The parser that has been designed for ALICE relies on the strategic approach van Dijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1983 implemented through production systems and constitutes a first step toward the construction of a psychologically viable mental parser.
E85-1012.txt,139,The parsing process is organized around a set of parsing specialists.
E85-1012.txt,140,The monitor is in charge of controlling the overall parsing activity and of directing the operation of the specialists towards the construction of the BLR.
E85-1012.txt,141,It utilizes a set of construction rutes which represent knowledge about the BLR_comma_ about the use of the specialists_comma_ and about the use of the information supplied by the specialists for the construction and validation of the BLR.
E85-1012.txt,142,The specialists are devoted to analise the input text and to supply the information necessary to the monitor.
E85-1012.txt,143,The general philosophy of the parser is to exploit any and at1 available Knowledge whenever helpful.
E85-1012.txt,144,The specialists are therefore supposed to be competent in each of the severals domains which are involved in the comprehension activity and to cover the wide spectrum of different capabilities required to build up the BLR.
E85-1012.txt,145,The following specialists are used morpholexical specialist syntactic specialist semantic specialist quantification specialist reference specialist time specialist.
E85-1012.txt,146,The morpholexica specialist analyzes the words contained in the natural language sentences.
E85-1012.txt,147,It is the specialist which performs the segmentation of words into morphemes and which looks up the dictionary for their definition.
E85-1012.txt,148,In case the processed word is unknown_comma_ the specialist provides some hypotheses about its morpholexical features gender_comma_ nu er_comma_ lexical class_comma_ etc. which will be used for guessing_comma_ in collaboration with the other specialists_comma_ the meaning of the new word.
E85-1012.txt,149,The syntactic specialist tries to discover the surface structure of each sentence_comma_ and to recognize its functional organization.
E85-1012.txt,150,The rules it utilizes do not represent a granmnar for the language but only some hypotheses concerning the role of word order in the determination of meaning.
E85-1012.txt,151,The semantic specialist is aimed at proposing a first tentative interpretation of the natural language sentences as a series of BLR propositions.
E85-1012.txt,152,It recognizes the predicates which will be used in the construction of propositions and checks that such predicates will be instantiated with the correct arguments_comma_ The quantification PeCialist is used to discover how the arguments of the propositions could be quantified.
E85-1012.txt,153,The reference specialist is devoted to examine if each concept conveyed by the input text represent a unique token or if it refers to other concepts known by the system.
E85-1012.txt,154,The time specialist examines the time specifications contained in the text which ire implicit in the tense of verbs or explicitly stated through the use of temporal adverbs or time expressions.
E85-1012.txt,156,AN EXAMPLE This section gives an idea of the parser operation by following in some detail the analysis of a small sample text.
E85-1012.txt,157,Let us consider the following sentence La materia e composta da molte sostanze differenti. The matter is composed of many different substances. As mentioned above_comma_ ALICE works under the control of the monitor which directs and coordinates theactivity of the specialists.
E85-1012.txt,158,The monitor starts by examining the first word of the sentence and puts the following information into the working memory 10 B UAL I_comma_ LA 20 B UAL PROC WORD_comma_ I .
E85-1012.txt,159,BLR constitutes in ALICE the conm n language through which the specialists can exchange information and communicate with each other.
E85-1012.txt,160,The only difference between the standard BLR as described in Fum_comma_ Guida Tasso_comma_ 1984 and the formalism here utilized is the .
E85-1015.txt,1,paper introduces a special programming environment for the definition of grammars and for the implementation of corresponding parsers. In natural language processing systems it is advantageous to have linguistic knowledge and processing mechanisms separated.
E85-1015.txt,2,Our environment accepts grammars consisting of binary dependency relations and grammatical functions.
E85-1015.txt,3,Well formed expressions of functions and relations provide constituent surroundings for syntactic categories in the form of two way automata.
E85-1015.txt,4,These relations_comma_ functions_comma_ and automata are described in a special definition language.
E85-1015.txt,5,In focusing on high level descriptions a linguist may ignore computational details of the parsing process.
E85-1015.txt,6,He writes the grammar into a DPL description and a compiler translates it into efficient LISP code.
E85-1015.txt,7,The environment has also a tracing facility for the parsing process_comma_ grammar sensitive lexical maintenance programs_comma_ and routines for the interactive graphic display of parse trees and grammar definitions.
E85-1015.txt,8,Translator routines are also available for the transport of compiled code between various LISP dialects.
E85-1015.txt,9,The environment itself exists currently in INTERLISP and FRANZLISP.
E85-1015.txt,10,This paper focuses on knowledge engineering issues and does not enter linguistic argumentation. .
E85-1015.txt,11,Our objective has been to build a parser for Finnish to work as a practical tool in real production applications.
E85-1015.txt,12,In the beginning of our work we were faced with two major problems.
E85-1015.txt,13,First_comma_ so far there was no formal description of the Finnish grammar.
E85-1015.txt,14,Second difficulty was that Finnish differs by its structure greatly from the Indoeuropean languages.
E85-1015.txt,15,Finnish has relatively free word order and syntactico semantic knowledge in a sentence is often expressed in the inflections of the words.
E85-1015.txt,16,Therefore existing parsing methods for Indoeuropean languages eg. ATN_comma_ DCG_comma_ LFG etc. did not seem to grasp the idiosyncracies of Finnish.
E85-1015.txt,17,The parser system we have developed is based on functional dependency.
E85-1015.txt,18,Grammar is specified by a family of two way finite automata and by dependency function and relation definitions.
E85-1015.txt,19,Each automaton expresses the valid dependency context of one constituent type.
E85-1005.txt,1,to separate the temporal expression from the basic proposition_comma_ so that the representation of the temporal expresssion takes the following form I k p 3 I_comma__comma_ I _comma_ ...S time Rel_comma_ Ij_comma_l_comma_ k .. Pred. l.J m. AT I_comma__comma_ p where the I_comma_ are intervals_comma_ the Relj are binary relations between intervals like before _comma_ the Predw are predicates like yesterday _comma_ and p is a basic proposition_comma_ from which all time relevant parts have been removed. The category of expression I be applied to a basic proposi functional way. is t t it can tion in a The interpretation of I is the set of propositions that are true at some given interval I_comma_.
E85-1005.txt,2,This is similar to Kripke s definition of the notion of possible world A possible world is given by the descriptive conditions we associate with it .... 1972_comma_ p. 44 .
E85-1005.txt,3,Analogously_comma_ a time interval can be identified with the collection of propositions that are true at it.
E85-1005.txt,5,A theory of time meanings.
E85-1005.txt,6,In many discussions of time meaning_comma_ a Oistinction is made between an internal and an external temporal system.
E85-1005.txt,7,The external system represents the temporal relation between the state of affairs as described by the basic proposition and the time at which the utterance takes place.
E85-1005.txt,8,This system always refers to the speaker or writer_comma_ and consequently it is a deictic system.
E85-1005.txt,9,The internal system is about such things as whether the state of affairs expressed in the basic proposition is described as going on_comma_ having lust started_comma_ having been completed_comma_ etc. This type of information is often called aspectual.
E85-1005.txt,10,In this paper_comma_ we adopt the following three basic principles for the representation of time meanings I Each time meaning representation contains exactly three time intervals the time of speech or narration S the time of event E _comma_ i.e. the interval at which the basic proposition is said to be true one time of reference R The S interval consists of one point only it is a singleton.
E85-1005.txt,11,The R and E intervals are non empty subsets of time.
E85-1005.txt,12,II The deictic part of time meaning is represented by a binary relation between S and R and optionally by one predicate over R_comma_ Ill Aspect is represented by a binary relation between R and E_comma_ and optionally by one predicate over E.
E85-1005.txt,13,Principles 1 _comma_ II _comma_ and Ill together imply that the general form of a time meaning representation can be somewhat simplified.
E85-1005.txt,14,It will now be 2 k p 3 S_comma_R_comma_E time Relt R_comma_S Pred. R Rel E_comma_R Pred E AT E_comma_p Apart from the constraints on possible time meaning representations there are some constraints on the relation between the time meanings and the language specific morphosyntactic forms for expressing those meanings IV The predicates over R are those time adverbials that can be used as answers to when questions_comma_ such as 3 yesterday_comma_ now_comma_ next week_comma_ on Tuesday V The predicates over E are a.o. the duration time adverbials_comma_ such as 4 for an hour_comma_ five weeks_comma_ since Christmas_comma_ until une vI The relations between R and S and between E and R are determined by the interaction of the verbal tense forms and the time adverbials in ways to be specified and exemplified in section three.
E85-1005.txt,15,We will now present the deictic and the aspectual components of the temporal system in some detail.
E85-1005.txt,17,The deictic system.
E85-1005.txt,18,As possible relations between S and R we will take i before R_comma_S _comma_ defined as in I.
E85-1005.txt,19,ii after R_comma_S _comma_ defined analogously iii contain R_comma_S _comma_ defined as follows t s time t S  t R 36 The specifiers of the reference time are the when adverbials.
E85-1005.txt,20,A classification of the latter that appears to be relevant for the assignment of deictic values in particular cases is the following one in fact_comma_ an iterative interpretation_comma_ and for such interpretations we need a more complex representation format.
E85-1005.txt,21,This will not be developed in this paper_comma_ but see Van Eynde forthcoming . deictic absolute before after contain on Tuesday yesterday n xt now week The deictic when adverbials define the position of the reference time with respect to the time of speech_comma_ and cannot be combined with all possible tenses.
E85-1005.txt,22,An after adverbial is_comma_ for instance_comma_ not compatible with the simple past 5 he came next week The absolute when adverbials determine the position of the reference time independently from the speech time.
E85-1005.txt,23,Depending an which tense they are combined with they can either specify a reference time that precedes the speech time_comma_ as in b she came on Tuesday or a reference time that follows the speech time_comma_ as in 7 she comes is coming will cole on Tuesday Since there is only one reference time in the representation principle I and since the when adverbials always specify the reference time principle IV _comma_ it is predicted that a proposition can contain at most one when adverbial.
E85-1005.txt,24,At first sight this prediction seems to hold of. the ungrammaticality of 8 a. He left yesterday one week ago b. In 1990 he will have arrived in 1998 c. In 1955 he had died in 1944 There are_comma_ however_comma_ some problem cases_comma_ such as 9 He left on Tuesday at 9 o clock 10 Last year he used to arrive at 9 o clock 9 contains two when adverbials_comma_ but notice that they can be used together as an answer to one when question_comma_ and this indicates that on Tuesday at 9 o clock is just a complex specification of one and the same interval.
E85-1005.txt,25,10 is a more serious case.
E85-1005.txt,26,Here the two adverbials cannot be considered to specify the same interval last year denotes the time of his habit to arrive at 9 o clock and at 9 o clock denotes the time of each of his arrivals of last year.
E85-1005.txt,27,What we have in 10 is_comma_ 2.2.
E85-1005.txt,28,The aspectual part.
E85-1005.txt,29,There is much discussion in the literature about what aspect is.
E85-1005.txt,30,A description that is nat very precise_comma_ but has the merit of being independent of linguistic form_comma_ is the one given by Coerie 1976_comma_ p. 3 As the general definition of aspect_comma_ we may take the formulation that aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of a situation .
E85-1005.txt,31,In an article on the general theory of aspect Friedrich distinguishes three possible aspects i punctual_comma_ completive_comma_ perfective_comma_ etc ii durative_comma_ continuative_comma_ etc iii stative_comma_ perfect_comma_ etc. of. Friedrich 1974_comma_ p. 36 The same three aspects turn up in the work of Coerie_comma_ 3ohnsan_comma_ Hopper_comma_ and others.
E85-1005.txt,32,We will call them respectively perfective_comma_ imperfective_comma_ and retrospective.
E85-1005.txt,33,The intuitions about the three are basically the following i perfective This aspect presents a situation as a single unanalyzable whole Camrie_comma_ o.c._comma_ p. 3 .
E85-1005.txt,34,ii imperfective This aspect looks at the situation from the inside Comrie_comma_ op. tit_comma_ p.4 _comma_ and focusses on beginning_comma_ continuation_comma_ or ending of it.
E85-1005.txt,35,iii retrospective This aspect expresses a relation between two time points_comma_ on the one hand the time of the state resulting from a prior situation_comma_ and on the other the time of that prior situation. ibid._comma_ p. 52 .
E85-1005.txt,36,In order to make these nations more precise_comma_ and at the same time to integrate them into our representation format_comma_ we will adopt the following proposal by Johnson What I am proposing concerning the semantics of the aspect forms is that they specify the relation between reference time and event time in an utterance. Johnson 1981_comma_ p. 153 37 As applied to the different aspects this gives the following results i perfective In th_comma_s case we take the relation between E and R to be one of containment during E_comma_R twhere the latter is defined as follows during ix_comma_y iff t E time it s x  t e y The fact that E is contained in R is meant to be the formal counterpart of the intuition that E is seen as a single unanalyzable whole from the point of view defined by R.
E85-1005.txt,37,ii imperfect re This is subdivided into three classes ii.i durative contain E_comma_R _comma_ defined as in 2.1. focus on the continuation ii.ii inchoative since E_comma_R _comma_ definition sinceix_comma_y iff x n y  3 t E time t e time it E x t E y  t t 3 t E time t s time it x t E y  t t ifocus on the beginning of E iii.iii terminative Until iE_comma_R _comma_ definition untilix_comma_y iff x n y e 3 t e time t E time t s x t E y  t t  3 t s time t i time t E x t E y  t t focus on the ending of E iii retrospective The relation is simply before E_comma_R .
E85-1005.txt,38,Some authors also distinguish a socalled prospective aspect of. Comrie 1976 .
E85-1005.txt,39,It seems to be less common than the other ones_comma_ and there is some disagreement on the issue of what its language specific counterparts are to be going to _comma_ but conceptually it can be defined fairly easily_comma_ namely as the complement of the retrospective aspect iv prospective after E_comma_R The interval E can be specified by adverbials.
E85-1005.txt,40,One class of E specifiers is the class of duration adverbials.
E85-1005.txt,41,The reasons for treating these adverbials as E specifiers are the following ones I. they always denote the interval at which the basic proposition is said to take place in that respect they are different from the when adverbials_comma_ since the latter can also denote a time that does not coincide with the event time of. the non perfect re aspects .
E85-1005.txt,42,2. they cannot be combined with all possible propositions they are_comma_ for instance_comma_ not compatible with momentaneous events 11 they reached the summit for a while The ungrammaticality of 411 can be explained if we take the duration adverbials to specify the event time_comma_ since the latter cannot be both a moment as required by the proposition and an interval of some duration las required by the adverbial .
E85-1005.txt,43,3. they never have a de eric function they are not used for specifying the relation between some interval and the.moment of speech. As in the case of the when adverbials it is possible to have two duration adverbials in the same clause 12 he has been studying two hours a day since his childhood now Notice_comma_ however_comma_ that i12 has an iterative interpretation_comma_ and since the treatment of such interpretations requires a more elaborated representation scheme anyway_comma_ we can stick to the principle that a clause contains at most one E specifier.
E85-1005.txt,44,In this case the E specifier is since his childhood two hours is another type of specifier cf. Van Eynde_comma_ forthcoming .
E85-1005.txt,46,The calculus as a whole.
E85-1005.txt,47,In the preceding sections it has been stipulated that there are three possible relations between S and R_comma_ and six possible relations between R and E.
E85-1005.txt,48,At first sight that seems to be rather arbitrary_comma_ but a careful analysis of the concepts involved shows that they_comma_ in fact_comma_ exhaust the range of logical possibilities For any tuo intervals x and y c time_comma_ either x n y 0 and then either beforeix_comma_y or after x_comma_y or x n y 0 and then either x c y_comma_ i.e.
E85-1005.txt,49,during x_comma_y or x c y and then either x y_comma_ i.e.
E85-1005.txt,50,contain x_comma_yJ or x y and then either since x_comma_v or until x_comma_y These are the six aspectual values.
E85-1005.txt,51,The reason why the de eric system has only three possible values is that the speech time unlike the reference and the event time is always a singleton_comma_ and if one of the intervals involved is a singleton_comma_ then the relations since and until and either during or contain cannot hold by definition. It appears_comma_ thus_comma_ that both the deictic and the aspectual distinctions are not only mutually exclusive but also exhaustive within their respective domains. Together they form the core of the temporal calculus. This core has to be extended in various ways if one wants to take into account the phenomenon of iterativity_comma_ the sequence of tenses in complex sentences_comma_ and the relevance of the event type of the basic proposition of. Vendler s distinction of 38 states_comma_ activities_comma_ accomplishments_comma_ achievements .
E85-1005.txt,52,Part of this has already been incorporated in the formalism_comma_ but in stead of presenting those extensions me think it more useful to round off this paper with a demonstration of how the calculus can be used for the interlingual analysis of verbal tense forms.
E85-1005.txt,54,The interlingual analysis of tenses.
E85-1005.txt,55,For the interlingual analysis of the verbal tense Torms e adopt the following principle VII The interlingual representations of verbal tense forms are pairs consisting of one deictic and one aspectual value.
E85-1005.txt,56,As the number of possible combinations of deictic and aspectual values is 18 3x6 _comma_ it follows that each tense form can have at most 18 different interlingual representations.
E85-1005.txt,57,In order to determine which values a given tense can actually have one has to examine its compatibility with the different types of time adverbials.
E85-1036.txt,1,evaluation is one of the most challenging problems in the field of text processing. In the paper we focus on the notion of importance from a computational standpoint_comma_ and we propose a procedural_comma_ rule based approach to importance evaluation.
E85-1036.txt,2,This novel approach is supported by a prototype experimental system_comma_ called importance evaluator_comma_ that can deal with descriptive texts taken from computer science literature on operating systems.
E85-1036.txt,3,The evaluator relies on a set of importance rules that are used to assign importance values to the different parts of a text and to resolve or explain conflicting evaluations.
E85-1036.txt,4,The system utilizes world knowledge on the subject domain contained in an encyclopedia and takes into account a goal assigned by the user for specifying the pragmatic aspects of the understanding activity.
E85-1036.txt,5,The paper describes the role of the evaluator in the frame of a larger system for text summarization SUSY it illustrates its overall mode of operation_comma_ and discusses some meaningful examples.
E85-1036.txt,7,Text understanding has received increasing attention in recent years.
E85-1036.txt,8,A major problem in this area is that of importance evaluation not all the components of a sufficiently large and structured piece of text are equally important for the reader_comma_ and humans are able to evaluate the relative importance of the parts of the texts they read.
E85-1036.txt,9,This issue has been faced so far only in an indirect way in the literature on discourse structure Kintsch and van Dijk_comma_ 1978 van Dijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1983 _comma_ summarization Lehrert_comma_ 1982 and 1984 Wilensky_comma_ 1982 Hahn and Reimer_comma_ 1984 _comma_ and inference Schank_comma_ 1979 .
E85-1036.txt,10,Moreover_comma_ several studies in the field of summarization e.g. Schank_comma_ 1979 and 1982 Lehnert_comma_ 1982 and 1984 Wilensky_comma_ 1982 have mostly been concerned with narrative texts stories _comma_ and it is not at all obvious that the approaches which proved successful in this area  also with Laboratorio di Psicologia E.E._comma_ Universita di Trieste_comma_ Trieste_comma_ Italy t also with Milan Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project_comma_ Milano_comma_ Italy  also with CISM International Center for Mechanical Sciences_comma_ Udine_comma_ Italy could be applied to descriptive texts as well.
E85-1036.txt,11,Expository prose has its own specific features Graesser_comma_ 1981 _comma_ and it seems to require different understanding processes_comma_ different summarization skills_comma_ and different cognitive models Lehnert_comma_ 1984 .
E85-1036.txt,12,Work on the problem of understanding and summarizing expository prose is still at the very beginning Hahn and Reimer_comma_ 1984 .
E85-1036.txt,13,In this paper we focus on the notion of importance from a computational standpoint_comma_ and we propose a rule based approach to importance evaluation.
E85-1036.txt,14,This research is part of a larger project aimed at developi ng a system for understanding and summarizing descriptive texts SUSY_comma_ a SUmmarizing SYstem _comma_ which is in progress a Te University of SUSY proposes an approach to descriptive text understanding and summarization Fum_comma_ Guida_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1982_comma_ 1983_comma_ and 1984 in which the process of representing the meaning of a natural language text is split into three main tasks_comma_ namely sentence understanding_comma_ structure capturing_comma_ and i mportance eval uati on.
E85-1036.txt,15,The sentence understandin 9 phase works on the single s that constitute a given natural language text and maps them into a formal internal representation_comma_ called basic linear representation BLR .
E85-1036.txt,16,The BLR is essentially a propositional language appropriately extended and completed to deal with the most relevant features of text representation_comma_ and fully worked out in a way suitable for computer implementation Fum_comma_ Guida_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1984 .
E85-1036.txt,17,The BLR representation of a text i s consti tuted by a sequence of I abel ed propositions_comma_ each of them constituted by a predicate with instantiated arguments or representing an ISA relation between concepts.
E85-1036.txt,18,This phase includes the understanding of the literal meaning of each sentence in the text_comma_ the appropriate representation of time relations_comma_ and the treatment of quantification and reference.
E85-1036.txt,19,The structure capturing phase works on the BLR and produces an augmented version of it_comma_ called extended linear representation ELR .
E85-1036.txt,20,This phase on two maln points inferring and expliciting the macro structure of the text van Dijk_comma_ 1977 Kintsch and van Dijk_comma_ 1978 van Dijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1983 _comma_ that accounts for the conceptual connection coherence among sentences Hobbs_comma_ 1982 and 1983 244 recognizing and expliciting the rhetoric structure of the text_comma_ which explains how the flow of ideas and the arguments of the writer are organized and implemented in the text.
E85-1036.txt,21,The importance evaluation phase operates on the ELR and attaches appropriate markers to its components in order to produce a new representation_comma_ called hierarchical propositional network HPN .
E85-1036.txt,22,The HPN is a tree like structure whose n s_comma_ corresponding to concepts and propositions of the ELR_comma_ are assigned different importance values integers according to their relative importance in the text.
E85-1036.txt,23,Once the HPN representation of a text has been produced_comma_ it is easy to prune the less relevant parts in order to obtain the representation of an appropriate summary to be eventually translated into natural language.
E85-1036.txt,24,These last phases i.e._comma_ pruning and generation are_comma_ for the moment_comma_ outside the scope of this research.
E85-1036.txt,25,The purpose of this paper is to investigate in some detail the phase of importance evaluation_comma_ and to illustrate the results obtained in the design and experimentation of a prototype system that can produce from the ELR of a given text a reasonable HPN.
E85-1036.txt,26,The paper is organized as follows section two introduces the topic of importance evaluation and discusses some basic conceptual aspects_comma_ in section three the overall organization of the system is presented with particular attention to knowledge representation_comma_ section four illustrates some examples of importance evaluation_comma_ and section five concludes the paper.
E85-1036.txt,28,EVALUATING IMPORTANCE The topic of importance evaluation has been dealt with in recent years_comma_ although often only in a quite indirect way_comma_ by several authors and in many different contexts.
E85-1036.txt,29,A part of a text can be considered important in relation to other segments of the same text according to several criteria it embodies knowledge necessary to understand other parts of the text van Dijk_comma_ 1977 Kintsch and van Dijk_comma_ 1978 it is relevant to the topic of discourse Lehnert 1982 and 1984 it is useful to clarify the relations that make discourse coherent Hobbs_comma_ 1982 it relates to the topic focus articulation Haji ova and Sgall_comma_ 1984 it refers to objects or relations in the subject domain that are judged to be important a priori Schank_comma_ 1979 it is unusual_comma_ new_comma_ or abnormal in the subject domain Schank_comma_ 1979 it generates surprise van Dijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1983 it is relevant to some specific reader s goal or need Fum_comma_ Guida_comma_ and Tasso_comma_ 1982 .
E85-1036.txt,30,In practice_comma_ if we test these criteria on sample texts_comma_ they result sometimes complementary_comma_ sometimes partially overlapping_comma_ sometimes even conflicting.
E85-1036.txt,31,Moreover_comma_ different readers may judge differently the importance of the same text on some parts a general consensus may be achieved_comma_ but the evaluation of other parts may be definitely subjective.
E85-1036.txt,32,In fact_comma_ important means specially relevant to some goal _comma_ and_comma_ whenever the goal with which a text is read changes_comma_ the parts of text which are to be considered important vary accordingly.
E85-1036.txt,33,Even if the goal of reading is only seldom considered explicitly by humans_comma_ still some goal is always implicitly assumed.
E85-1036.txt,34,Different readers or the same reader in different moments may have different goals_comma_ and conflicting judgments of importance may be due to the consideration of different goals_comma_ rather than to the application of different evaluation procedures.
E85-1036.txt,35,The above investigation shows that importance is a really multifaceted concept which escapes a simple_comma_ explicit_comma_ algorithmic definition.
E85-1036.txt,36,A procedural_comma_ knowledge based approach comprising a set of rules that can assign relative importance values to the different parts of a text and can resolve or explain conflicting evaluations seems more appropriate.
E85-1036.txt,37,Such an approach allows taking into account in a flexible and natural way the variety of knowledge sources and processing activities that are involved in importance evaluation.
E85-1036.txt,38,Moreover_comma_ it is expected to be well founded from a cognitive point of view van Dijk and Kintsch_comma_ 1983 Anderson_comma_ 1976 _comma_ as it allows close and transparent modeling of several processes that occur in human mind.
E85-1036.txt,40,A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH Most of the ideas outlined in the previous section have been implemented in the design of a subsystem of SUSY_comma_ called the importance evaluator_comma_ that takes in input the ELR representation of a natural language text and the representation of a reader s goal and produces in output the corresponding HPN.
E85-1036.txt,41,The evaluator is implemented by a rule based system Davis and King_comma_ 1976 with a forward chaining control regime.
E85-1036.txt,42,Knowledge available to the evaluator comprises two parts a rule base and an encyclopedia.
E85-1036.txt,43,The rule base embodies expert knowledge necessary r importance evaluation.
E85-1036.txt,44,It is constituted by production rules_comma_ called importance rules_comma_ having the usual IF THEN form.
E85-1036.txt,45,Rules can be 245 classified according to their competence_comma_ i.e. to the different types of knowledge utilized for evaluating importance.
E85-1036.txt,46,From this point of view_comma_ three classes of rules are considered structural rules_comma_ which express the fact that some parts of the text can be judged important just by looking at their structure and organization_comma_ discarding thei r meaning semantic ules_comma_ which can evaluate importance by specifically taking into account some specific structural features of the text that convey a definite meaning encyclopedic rules_comma_ which can evaluate importance by comparing the meaning of the text with domain specific knowledge contained in the encyclopedia.
E85-1036.txt,47,The IF part of the rules contains conditions that are evaluated with respect to the current HPN initially the ELR _comma_ and the THEN part specifies either an importance evaluation or an action to be performed to further the analysis e.g._comma_ a strategic choice_comma_ a criterion to solve conflicting evaluations_comma_ etc. .
E85-1036.txt,48,The evaluation of importance contained in the THEN part of a rule takes usually the form of an ordering relation e.g._comma_ less_comma_ equal_comma_ etc. among importance values of concepts or propositions of the ELR_comma_ or it specifies ranges of importance values e.g._comma_ high_comma_ low_comma_ etc. .
E85-1036.txt,49,Thus_comma_ rules only assert relative importance of different parts of the text a constraint propagation algorithm will eventually transform these relative evaluations into absolute importance values according to a given scale.
E85-1036.txt,50,The encyclopedia is the second knowledge source employed by the evaluator and it contains domain specific knowledge.
E85-1036.txt,51,Encyclopedic knowledge is represented through a net of frames.
E85-1036.txt,52,Frames embody_comma_ in addition to a header_comma_ two kinds of slots knowledge slots_comma_ that contain domain specific knowledge_comma_ represented in a form homogeneous with the propositional language of the ELR reference slots_comma_ containing pointers to other frames that deal with related topics in the subject domain.
E85-1036.txt,53,This organization allows easy implementation of a property inheritance mechanism.
E85-1036.txt,54,We now illustrate the notion of goal which is of crucial importance for understanding the overall mode of operation of the evaluator.
E85-1036.txt,55,The goal is a chunk of variable knowledge_comma_ assigned by the user taking into account the pragmatic aspects of the understanding activity_comma_ that defines the motivations and objectives that are behind the reading process.
E85-1036.txt,56,The role of the goal is twofold exerting control on the activation of importance rules that operate on the ELR selective focusing_comma_ i.e. enabling the evaluator to choose from the encyclopedia the pieces of knowledge which are expected to be relevant to the current importance evaluation.
E85-1036.txt,57,The use of the goal in selective focusing comprises two activities validating matching between the current ELR and the knowledge contained in a frame header or knowledge slot direct frame activation _comma_ or activating a new frame pointed at in a reference slot of a currently active frame i ndi rect frame acti vati on .
E85-1036.txt,58,Therefore_comma_ the encyclopedia does not contain any a priory judgment about importance.
E85-1036.txt,59,Full responsibility of this activity is left to the evaluator_comma_ which can interpret the content of the encyclopedia frames according to the current goal and can use the extracted knowledge to support the rule based evaluation process.
E85-1036.txt,61,SAMPLE OPERATION OF THE EVALUATOR The current prototype version of the evaluator operates on simple texts taken from scientific and technical computer science literature on operating systems.
E85-1036.txt,62,It includes about 40 importance rules and a small encyclopedia of about 30 frames.
E85-1036.txt,63,The goal has been assigned a very simple structure it is a logical con ination of key terms_comma_ chosen in a predefinite set_comma_ that represent possible points of view a reader can take in analyzing a text.
E85-1036.txt,64,In this section we will illustrate some of the most basic mechanisms of importance evaluation through a few examples.

E85-1036.txt,68,We assume hereinafter the goal KNOW_comma_ i.e._comma_ we are particularly interested in knowing the main technical features of the U DOS operating system.
E85-1036.txt,69,With such a goal_comma_ some pieces of the encyclopedia turn out to be relevant to the evaluation of our sample text_comma_ while others are discarded_comma_ as it will be illustrated below.
E85-1036.txt,70,In order to analyze the text_comma_ the evaluator generates from the ELR_comma_ as a preliminary step_comma_ a new structure_comma_ called the cohesion graph_comma_ that explicitly shows all the .
E85-1035.txt,1,paper reflects the view that the decoding of speech_comma_ either by computer systems or people_comma_ must to a large extent be determined by the ways in which the speaker has encoded the information necessary for its comprehension. We therefore place great emphasis on the use of psycholinguistics as a tool for the construction of models essential to the characterisation of the speech understanding task.
E85-1035.txt,2,We are primarily concerned with the interactions between the various levels at which a fragment of speech can be described e.g. acoustic phonetic_comma_ lexical_comma_ syntactic_comma_ etc _comma_ and the ways in which the knowledge bases associated with each of these levels contribute towards a final interpretation of an utterance.
E85-1035.txt,3,We propose to use the Chart Parser as a general computational framework for simulating such interactions_comma_ since its flexibility allows various models to be implemented and evaluated.
E85-1035.txt,4,Within this general framework we discuss problems of information flow and search strategy in combining evidence across levels of description and across time_comma_ during the extension of an hypothesis.
E85-1035.txt,5,We stress the importance of both psychological and computational theory in developing a particular control strategy which could be implemented within the framework. .
E85-1035.txt,6,The decoding of speech_comma_ either by computer systems or people_comma_ must to a large extent be determined by the ways in which the speaker has encoded the information necessary for its comprehension.
E85-1035.txt,7,Such a view is supported by a large body of experimental evidence concerning the ways in which various factors eg. predictability from context affect both the acoustic clarity with which a speaker pronounces an utterance_comma_ and the strategy the hearer appears to use in identifying it.
E85-1035.txt,8,The task of the Gerry Altmann Department of Linguistics Edinburgh University George Square Edinburgh EHB 9LL.
E85-1035.txt,9,GB compu er system is to mimic_comma_ though preferably model_comma_ this strategy.
E85-1035.txt,10,In order to do so_comma_ one should presumably draw on both computational and psychological theories of process.
E85-1035.txt,11,Such a dual approach has been shown to be feasible_comma_ and indeed desirable_comma_ by research into early visual processing eg. Marr 1976 which has shown that there can come a point when psychological and computational descriptions become barely distinguishable.
E85-1035.txt,12,This analogy with early visual processing is significant because central to the development of the vision research was the notion of modelling one can argue that a significant difference between the so called 4th Generation and 5th Genera ion technologies is that with the former adhoc algorithms are applied to often incomplete and unreliable data_comma_ while with 5th Generation systems_comma_ algorithms are devised by first constructing qualitative models suited to the task domain.
E85-1035.txt,13,We propose to use psycholinguistics as a tool for the construction of models essential to the characterisation of the speech understanding task.
E85-1035.txt,14,We believe that this approach is essential to the development of automated speech recognition systems_comma_ and will also prove beneficial to psychological models of human speech processing_comma_ the majority of which are underdetermined from a computational point of view.
E85-1035.txt,15,Rumelhart and McClelland have recently adopted a similar approach to account for the major findings in the psychological literature on letter perception.
E85-1035.txt,16,By constructing a detailed computational model of the processes involved they were able to give an alternative description of the recognition of certain letter strings_comma_ which was supported by subsequent psycholinguistic experiments.
E85-1035.txt,17,Rumelhart and McClelland emphasise the point that their results were not predictable on paper _comma_ but were the outcome of considerable experimentation with the computational model.
E85-1035.txt,18,239 Requirements of the Computational Framework The experience of the ARPA speech project_comma_ which resulted in the design of a number of speech recognition systems_comma_ has demonstrated that the task of controlling the interactions between the knowledge bases which make up the system is at least as problematic as that of defining the knowledge bases.
E85-1035.txt,19,Major inadequacies in the systems developed during the ARPA project can be attributed to an early commitment in one or more areas of design which were not apparent until final testing and evaluation of the complete system began.
E85-1035.txt,20,An architecture is required_comma_ therefore_comma_ which will permit the development in parallel and relatively independently of component knowledge bases and methods of deploying them computationally.
E85-1035.txt,21,It should also permit the evaluation and testing of solutions with partially specified or simulated components.
E85-1035.txt,22,This will ensure that the design of one component will not influence unduly the design of any other component_comma_ possibly to the detriment of both.
E85-1035.txt,23,In addition_comma_ we should have the ability to determine the consequences of component design decisions by testing their contributions to the overall goals of speech recognition.
E85-1035.txt,24,In order to fulfill these requirements we propose to use the active chart parser e.g. Thompson Ritchie_comma_ 1984 .
E85-1035.txt,25,This was specifically designed as a flexible framework for the implementation both serial and parallel of different rule systems_comma_ and the evaluation of strategies for using these rule systems.
E85-1035.txt,26,It is described below in more detail.
E85-1035.txt,27,The Computational Model The problem in designing optimal control or search strategies lies in combining evidence across different levels of description e.g. acoustic phonetic_comma_ morpho phonemic_comma_ syntactic_comma_ etc. _comma_ and across time during the extension of a hypothesis_comma_ such that promising interpretations are given priority and the right one wins.
E85-1035.txt,28,In this section we shall consider just a few of the issues concerning this flow of information.
E85-1035.txt,29,Automated speech systems_comma_ in particular those implemented during the ARPA SUR project_comma_ have been forced to confront the errorfull and ambiguous nature of speech_comma_ and to devise methods of controlling the very large search space of partial interpretations generated during processing.
E85-1035.txt,30,Although the problem was exacerbated by the poor performance of the acoustic phonetic processing used in these systems_comma_ the experimental evidence suggests that the solution will not be found simply by improving techniques for low level feature detection.
E85-1035.txt,31,The situation appears to be analogous to that of visual processing_comma_ where significant features may be absent.
E85-1035.txt,32,If present_comma_ their significance may also be open to a number of interpretations.
E85-1035.txt,33,Combining evidence across different levels of description requires the specification of information flow between these levels.
E85-1035.txt,34,Within the psychological literature_comma_ there is a growing tendency away from strong or instructive interactions towards weak or selective interactions.
E85-1035.txt,35,With the latter_comma_ the only permissible flow of information involves the filtering out_comma_ by one component_comma_ of alternatives produced by other components cf. Marslen Wilson Tyler_comma_ 1980 Crain Steedman_comma_ 1982 Altmann Steedman_comma_ forthcoming _comma_ so in hierarchical terms no component determines what is produced by any other component beneath it.
E85-1035.txt,36,A strong interaction_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ allows one component to direct_comma_ or guide_comma_ ctively a second component in the pursuit of a particular hypothesis.
E85-1035.txt,37,Within the computational literature_comma_ weak interactions are also argued for on aesthetic grounds such as Marr s principles of modularity and least commitment Mart_comma_ 1982 .
E85-1035.txt,38,The strongly interactive heterarchical and blackboard models implemented in HWIM and Hearsay II respectively have been criticised for the extremely complex control strategies which they required.
E85-1035.txt,39,Problems arise with the heterarchical model because of the difficulties of generating each of the separate interfaces and_comma_ more importantly_comma_ because of the necessity of specifying the explicit control scheme. Reddy Erman_comma_ 1975 .
E85-1035.txt,40,Similar problems arise with existing blackboard models.
E85-1035.txt,41,Their information flow allows strong top down direction of components_comma_ resulting once again in highly complex control strategies.
E85-1035.txt,42,Hierarchical models have other problems_comma_ in that they allow too little interaction between the knowledge sources within a strictly hierarchical system_comma_ one cannot interleave the processes associated with each different level of knowledge_comma_ and hence one cannot allow the very early filtering out by higher level components of what might only be partial analyses at lower levels.
E85-1035.txt,43,This situation considered disadvantageous for reasons of speed and efficiency arises because of the lack of any common workspace over which the separate components can operate.
E85-1035.txt,44,There is_comma_ however_comma_ much to be said for hierarchical systems in terms of the relative 240 simplicity of the control strategies needed to manage them_comma_ a consideration which is fundamental to the design of any speech recognition system.
E85-1035.txt,45,The model currently being developed embodies a weak hierarchical interaction_comma_ since this seems most promising on both psychological and computational grounds.
E85-1035.txt,46,Unlike existing hierarchical or associative models_comma_ it uses a uniform global data structure_comma_ a chart .
E85-1035.txt,47,Associated with this structure is the active chart parser.
E85-1035.txt,48,The active chart parser consists of the following I A uniform global data structure the Chart _comma_ represents competing pathways through a search space_comma_ at different levels of description_comma_ and at different stages of analysis.
E85-1035.txt,49,Complete descriptions are marked by inactive paths_comma_ called edges_comma_ spanning temporally defined portions of the utterance.
E85-1035.txt,50,These inactive edges have pointers to the lower level descriptions which support them.
E85-1035.txt,51,Partial descriptions are marked by active edges which carry representations of the data needed to complete them.
E85-1035.txt,52,For example_comma_ a syntactic edge_comma_ such as a noun phrase_comma_ may span any complete descriptions that partially support it_comma_ such as a determiner or adjective.
E85-1035.txt,53,In addition_comma_ it will carry a description of the syntactic properties e.g. noun any inactive lexical edge must have to count both as additional evidence for this syntactic description and as justification for its extension or completion.
E85-1035.txt,54,The type and complexity of the descriptions are determined by the rule based knowledge systems used by the parser_comma_ and are not determined by the parser itself.
E85-1035.txt,55,2 A multi level task queueing structure the Agenda _comma_ which is used to order the ways in which the descriptions will be extended_comma_ through time and level of .
E85-1025.txt,1,Alshawi_comma_ Bran Boguraev_comma_ Ted Briscoe Computer Laboratory_comma_ Cambridge University Corn Exchange Street Cambridge CB2 3QG_comma_ U.K. In this article we describe research on the development of large dictionaries for natural language processing.
E85-1025.txt,2,We detail the development of a dictionary support environment linking a restructrured version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English to natural language processing systems.
E85-1025.txt,3,We describe the process of restructuring the information in the dictionary and our use of the Longman grammar code system to construct dictionary entries for the PATR II parsing system and our use of the Longman word definitions for automated word sense classification. .
E85-1025.txt,4,Recent developments in linguistics_comma_ and especially on grammatical theory for example_comma_ Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar GPSG Gazdar et al._comma_ In Press _comma_ Lexical Functional Grammar LFG Kaplan Bresnan_comma_ 1982 and on natural language parsing frameworks for example_comma_ Functional Unification Grammar FUG Kay_comma_ 1984a _comma_ PATR II Shieber_comma_ 1984 make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language.
E85-1025.txt,5,These developments also demonstrate that if natural language processing systems are to be able to handle the grammatical and logical idiosyncracies of individual lexical items elegantly and efficiently_comma_ then the lexicon must be a central component of the parsing system.
E85-1025.txt,6,Real time parsing imposes stringent requirements on a dictionary support environment at the very least it must allow frequent and rapid access to the information in the dictionary via the dictionary head words.
E85-1025.txt,7,The idea of using the machine readable source of a published dictionary has occurred to a wide range of researchers for spelling correction_comma_ lexical analysis_comma_ thesaurus construction_comma_ machinetranslation_comma_ to name but a few applications very few however have used such a dictionary to support a natural language parsing system.
E85-1025.txt,8,Most of the work on automated dictionaries has concentrated on extracting lexical or other information in_comma_ essentially_comma_ batch processing eg. Amsler_comma_ 1981 Walker Amsler_comma_ 1983 _comma_ or on developing dictionary servers for office automation systems Kay_comma_ 1984b .
E85-1025.txt,9,Few parsing systems have substantial lexicons and even those which employ very comprehensive grammars eg. Robinson_comma_ 1982 Bobrow_comma_ 1978 consult relatively small lexicons_comma_ typically generated by hand.
E85-1025.txt,10,Two exceptions to this generalisation are the Linguistic String Project Sager_comma_ 1981 and the Epistle Project Heidorn et al._comma_ 1982 the former employs a dictionary of less than 10_comma_000 words_comma_ most of which are specialist medical terms_comma_ the latter has well over 100_comma_000 entries_comma_ gathered from machine readable sources_comma_ however_comma_ their grammar formalism and the limited grammatical information supplied by the dictionary make this achievement_comma_ though impressive_comma_ theoretically less interesting.
E85-1025.txt,11,We chose to employ the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Procter 1978_comma_ henceforth LDOCE as the machine readable source for our dictionary environment because this dictionary has several properties which make it uniquely appropriate for use as the core knowledge base of a natural language processing system.
E85-1025.txt,12,Most prominent among these are the rich grammatical subcategorisations of the 60_comma_000 entries_comma_ the large amount of information concerning phrasal verbs_comma_ noun compounds and idioms_comma_ the individual subject_comma_ collocational and semantic codes for the entries and the consistent use of a controlled core vocabulary in defining the words throughout the dictionary.
E85-1025.txt,13,Michiels 1982 gives further description and discussion of LDOCE from the perspective of natural language processing. The problem of utilising LDOCE in natural language processing falls into two areas.
E85-1025.txt,14,Firstly_comma_ we must provide a dictionary environment which links the dictionary to our existing natural language processing systems in the appropriate fashion and secondly_comma_ we must restructure the information in the dictionary in such a way that these systems are able to utilise it effectively.
E85-1025.txt,15,These two tasks form the subject matter of the next two sections.
E85-1025.txt,16,171 THE ACCESS ENVIRONMENT To link the machine readable version of LDOCE to existing natural language processing systems we need to provide fast access from Lisp to data held in secondary storage.
E85-1025.txt,17,Furthermore_comma_ the complexity of the data structures stored on disc should not be constrained in any way by the method of access_comma_ because we have little idea what form the restructured dictionary may eventually take.
E85-1025.txt,18,Our first task in providing an environment was therefore the creation ofa lispifed version ofthe machine readable LDOCE file.
E85-1025.txt,19,A batch program written in a general editing facility was used to convert the entrire LDOCE typesetting tape into a sequence of Lisp s expressions without any loss of generality or information.
E85-1025.txt,20,Figure 1 illustrates part of an entry as it appears in the published dictionary_comma_ on the typesetting tape and after lispification.
E85-1025.txt,22,Similarly_comma_ choice of font can be varied for reasons of appearance and occasionally information normally associated with one field of an entry is shifted into another to create a more compact or elegant printed entry.
E85-1025.txt,23,In addition to the noise generated by the fact that we are working with a typesetting tape geared to visual presentation_comma_ rather than a database_comma_ there are errors in the use of the grammar code system for example_comma_ Figure 4 illustrates the code for the first sense of the noun promise .
E85-1010.txt,1,METAL machine translation project incorporates two methods of structural transfer direct transfer and transfer by grammar. In this paper I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches in general and with respect to the METAL project_comma_ and argue that_comma_ for many applications_comma_ a combination of the two is preferable to either alone.
E85-1010.txt,3,One of the central design questions in machine translation is that of the best method of structural transfer_comma_ that is_comma_ the conversion from the syntactic analysis structure of the source language to the syntactic generation structure of the target language.
E85-1010.txt,5,This is the choice between the of an independent grammar_comma_ as one finds in the interlingua and tran er grammar approaches_comma_ and direct transfer_comma_ where transfer specifications are tied directly to source language structures.
E85-1010.txt,6,Since each method has its advantages and disadvantages_comma_ there is no b qi for favoring one over the other_comma_ independent of a particular application.
E85-1010.txt,7,However_comma_ it is highly likely that for a system with any significant range of application_comma_ neither approach will be completely satisfactory.
E85-1010.txt,8,Furthermore_comma_ decisions made in the design of other components of the system may render a homogeneous approach to transfer impractical.
E85-1010.txt,9,For both of these reasons_comma_ we have implemented in METAL a scheme for transfer which is sufficiently flexible to allow for the use of both direct transfer and transfer by grammar.
E85-1010.txt,10,This is done in such a way as to put control of the interaction in the hands of the grammar writer_comma_ allowing him to take maximum advantage of the strengths of each approach. in the following_comma_ I will contrast the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods mentioned above and illustrate how a combination can inherit the advantages of each by discu ing our experiences with a combined system in METAL.
E85-1010.txt,11,For the sake of clarity_comma_ I will first give an overview of the METAL architecture.
E85-1010.txt,13,Overview of METAL METAL is a machine translation system designed for the translation of technical texts.
E85-1010.txt,14,Currently_comma_ it is implemented for German to English translation_comma_ but preliminary work has begun on other language pairs.
E85-1010.txt,15,These efforts indicate that_comma_ by and large_comma_ the design is suitable for application to multiple source and target languages_comma_ and work is in progress to make this completely so.
E85-1010.txt,16,Translation proceeds in three phases analysis_comma_ integration_comma_ and transfer.
E85-1010.txt,17,The analysis phase consists of parsing the input sentence and building a phrase structure tree annotated with various grammatical features.
E85-1010.txt,19,During the transfer phase_comma_ the parse tree is structurally and lexicslly modified according to target language specifications.
E85-1010.txt,20,The output sentence is gotten by reading the terminal nodes of this tree.
E85-1010.txt,21,Our basic method of structural transfer is a fairly direct transfer.
E85-1010.txt,22,Rather than using a separate transfer grammar_comma_ transfer instructions are associated with each rule of the analysis grammar.
E85-1010.txt,23,W hen an analysis rule applies to build a node_comma_ stored on that node_comma_ along with grammatical features_comma_ is the set of transfer instructions associated with that rule.
E85-1010.txt,24,After integration_comma_ the selected parse tree is traversed from top to bottom_comma_ executing the transfer instructions associated with each node.
E85-1010.txt,25,The instructions typically consist of such things as feature passing_comma_ constituent reordering instructions_comma_ tree traversal messages_comma_ and lexical transfer instructions.
E85-1010.txt,26,Since the grammar writer chooses what transfer instructions to include and how to order them_comma_ he has significant control over the flow of the transfer procedure.
E85-1010.txt,27,An example of such a rule is given here.
E85-1010.txt,28,This is a rule for parsing German prepositional phrases.
E85-1010.txt,29,I have left out the various TEST_comma_ CONSTRuction and INTEGRation instructions relating to analysis and integration.
E85-1010.txt,31,Comments explaining the English transfer instructions are given in italics.
E85-1010.txt,33,After this modification_comma_ the sons are transferred according to the English instructions found on their nodes.
E85-1010.txt,34,After transfer_comma_ the preposition_comma_ now with English features becanse the node has been transferred_comma_ is checked for its position requirements.
E85-1010.txt,35,If it is a postposition_comma_ it is placed after 70 the noun phrase.
E85-1010.txt,36,For example_comma_ the structure associated with the phrase vor einer Woche is modified to yield a structure reflecting the the phrase a week ago .
E85-1010.txt,37,When other target languages are included_comma_ their transfer instructions will appear in this rule as SPAfqlSH_comma_ CHINESE or whatever.
E85-1010.txt,38,In this way_comma_ one analysis could simultaneously serve as input to the transfer procedures for several target languages.
E85-1010.txt,39,The type of direct transfer described here has several good points.
E85-1010.txt,40,It is very efficient because ere is no time wasted in trying rules which don t apply.
E85-1010.txt,41,By the same token_comma_ it is fairly easy for the linguist to guarantee the results of the transfer process because he can gear his rules to very specific structures.
E85-1010.txt,42,For example_comma_ there are several Ger _comma_ constructions which are analyzed by rules with a phrase structure specification NP NP NP.
E85-1010.txt,43,One of these is the genitive construction_comma_ as in ein Teil des Programms .
E85-1010.txt,44,The English transfer set se ciated with this particular rule contains instructions to insert the English genitive marker of so that the translation becomes part of the program .
E85-1010.txt,45,There is no wasted attempt to make this insertion in the similar_comma_ but not genitive_comma_ constructions.
E85-1010.txt,46,Likewise_comma_ transfer procedures peculiar to thoec structures are not applied in vain to the genitive construction.
E85-1010.txt,47,As one might suppoae_comma_ this method also has the real_comma_ if somewhat embarrassing_comma_ advantage of allowing for fairly easy implementation of ad hoc solutions_comma_ which_comma_ unfortunately must be resorted to from time to time.
E85-1010.txt,48,There are_comma_ of course_comma_ several disadvantages to doing things this way.
E85-1010.txt,49,If there are multiple source languages_comma_ the linguist must repeat_comma_ in perhaps non trivial ways_comma_ the same target language information for each aource grammar.
E85-1010.txt,50,There is no convenient way to sta e more global linguistic facts that don t relate to immediate constituent structure this is a problem for analysis as well .
E85-1010.txt,51,ALso_comma_ this method forces the description of the target language to be made in terms of the constituent structure of the source language.
E85-1010.txt,52,All of the are problems which are better handled in a grammm based approach to structural transfer.
E85-1010.txt,53,Our decision to incorporate a franker grammar grew out of the need to overcome the last two restrictions_comma_ particularly in the treatment of clauses.
E85-1010.txt,55,The use of transfer grammar in METAL The moat pr _comma_ in_S need for grammar based transfer was the result of the adoption of a canonical clause structure.
E85-1010.txt,56,The original impetus for using a canonical structure wu the need for an efficient analy_comma__comma_ds of the German clause.
E85-1010.txt,57,However_comma_ this canonical structure is put to use by METAL in another way_comma_ one which will_comma_ in all likelihood_comma_ insure its utility_comma_ or at least its necessity_comma_ for all source languages.
E85-1010.txt,58,The area which would require this is lexical transfer.
E85-1010.txt,59,Because the dependency between a verb and its object can influence greatly the lexical and structural transfer of both_comma_ as well as the structural transfer of the clause as a whole_comma_ it is very useful to do a certain amount of lexical transfer_comma_ in particular_comma_ verb transfer_comma_ at the clause level_comma_ where both the verb and its arguments are variable for inspection and manipulation.
E85-1010.txt,60,This is not a new idea.
E85-1010.txt,61,What is important here is that_comma_ although the grammar writer determines when and how clause level lexical transfer takes place_comma_ the proper functioning of the transfer procedure depends on the canonical structure of the clause.
E85-1010.txt,64,The effect of transforming during analysis and integration is that the constituent structure that is reflected by the analysis rule is by no means the constituent structure that actually exists at transfer time for the node built by that rule.
E85-1010.txt,65,This can be illustrated by the following two trees for the sentence dem Kind gab der Mann den Ball .
E85-1010.txt,66,The first is the parse tree that would have been bnilt ff the tree had not been transformed.
E85-1010.txt,67,The second is the actual tree that is built.
E85-1010.txt,68,The circled nodes are ones which are eljm nffited by flattening_comma_ the boxed node is one whose sons have been changed.
E85-1021.txt,1,paper is concerned with the specifications and the implementation of a particular concept of word based lexicon to be used for large natural language processing systems such as machine translation systems_comma_ and compares it with the morpheme based conception of the lexicon traditionally assumed in computational linguistics. It will be argued that_comma_ although less concise_comma_ a relational word based lexicon is superior to a morpheme based lexicon from a theoretical_comma_ computational and also practical viewpoint. .
E85-1021.txt,2,It has been traditionally assumed by computational linguists and particularly by designers of large natural language processing systems such as machine translation systems that the lexicon should be limited to lexical information that cannot be derived by rules.
E85-1021.txt,3,According to this view_comma_ a lexicon consists of a list of basic morphemes along with irregular or unpredictable words.
E85-1021.txt,4,In this paper_comma_ I would like to reexamine this traditional view of the lexicon and point out some of the problems it faces which seriously question the general adequacy of this model for natural language processing.
E85-1021.txt,5,As a trade off between the often conflicting linguistic_comma_ computational and also practical considerations_comma_ an alternative conception of the lexicon will be discussed_comma_ largely based on Jackendoff s 1975 proposal.
E85-1021.txt,6,According to this view_comma_ lexical entries are fully specified but related to one another.
E85-1021.txt,7,First developed for a French parser cf. Wehrli_comma_ 1984 _comma_ this model has been adopted for an English parser in development_comma_ as well as for the prototype of a French English translation system.
E85-1021.txt,8,This paper is organized as follows the first section addresses the general issue of what constitutes a lexical entry as well as the question of the relation between lexicon and morphology from the point of view of both theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics.
E85-1021.txt,9,Section 2 discusses the relational word based model of the lexicon and the role morphology is assigned in this model.
E85-1021.txt,10,Finally_comma_ it spells out some of the details of the implementation of this model.
E85-1021.txt,11,OVERVIEW OF THE PROBLSM One of the well known characteristic features of natural languages is the size and the complexity of their lexicons.
E85-1021.txt,12,This is in sharp constrast with artificial languages_comma_ which typically have small lexicons_comma_ in most cases made up of simple_comma_ unambiguous lexical items.
E85-1021.txt,13,Not only do natural languages have a huge number of lexical elements no matter what precise definition of this latter term one chooses but these lexical elements can furthermore i be ambiguous in several ways ii have a non trivial internal structure_comma_ or iii be part of compounds or idiomatic expressions_comma_ as illustrated in 1 A I ambiguous words can_comma_ fly_comma_ bank_comma_ pen_comma_ race_comma_ etc. 2 internal structure use ful ness_comma_ mis understand ing_comma_ lake s_comma_ tri ed 3 compounds milkman_comma_ moonlight_comma_ etc. 4 idiomatic expressions to kick the bucket_comma_ by and large_comma_ to pull someone s leg_comma_ etc. In fact_comma_ the notion of word_comma_ itself_comma_ is not all that clear_comma_ as numerous linguists theoreticians and or computational linguists have acknowledged.
E85-1021.txt,14,Thus_comma_ to take an example from the computational linguistics literature_comma_ Kay 1977 notes In common usage_comma_ the term word refers sometimes to sequences of letters that can be bounded by spaces or punctuation marks in a text.
E85-1021.txt,15,According to this view_comma_ run_comma_ runs_comma_ runnin and ran are different words.
E85-1021.txt,16,But common usage also allows these to count as instances of the same word because they belong to the 146 same paradigm in English accidence and are listed in the same entry in the dictionary. Some of these problems_comma_ as well as the general question of what constitutes a lexical entry_comma_ whether or not lexical items should be related to one another_comma_ etc. have been much debated over the last I0 or 15 years within the framework of generative grammar.
E85-1021.txt,17,Considered as a relatively minor appendix of the phrase structure rule component in the early days of generative grammar_comma_ the lexicon became little by little an autonomous component of the grammar with its own specific formalism lexical entries as matrices of features_comma_ as advocated by Chomsky 1965 .
E85-1021.txt,18,Finally_comma_ it also acquired specific types of rules_comma_ the so called word formation rules cf. Halle_comma_ 1973 Aronoff_comma_ 1976 Lieber_comma_ 1980 Selkirk_comma_ 1983_comma_ and others _comma_ and lexical redundancy rules cf. Jackendoff_comma_ 1975 Bresnan_comma_ 1977 .
E85-1021.txt,19,By and large_comma_ there seems to be widespread agreement among linguists that the lexicon should be viewed as the repository of all the idiosyncratic properties of the lexical items of a language phonological_comma_ morphological_comma_ syntactic_comma_ semantic_comma_ etc. .
E85-1021.txt,20,This agreement quickly disappears_comma_ however_comma_ when it comes to defining what constitutes a lexical item_comma_ or_comma_ to put it slightly differently_comma_ what the lexicon is a list of_comma_ and how should it be organized.
E85-1021.txt,21,Among the many proposals discussed in the linguistic literature_comma_ I will consider two radically opposed views that I shall call the morpheme bayed and the word based conceptions of the lexicon .
E85-1021.txt,22,The morpheme based lexicon corresponds to the traditional derivational view of the lexicon_comma_ shared by the structuralist school_comma_ many of the generative linguists and virtually all the computational linguists.
E85-1021.txt,23,According to this option_comma_ only non derived morphemes are actually listed in the lexicon_comma_ complex words being derived by means of morphological rules.
E85-1021.txt,24,In contrast_comma_ in a word based lexicon a la Jackendoff_comma_ all the words simple and complex are listed as independent lexical entries_comma_ derivational as well as inflectional relgt ons being expressed by means of redundancy rules .
E85-1021.txt,25,The crucial distinction between these two views of the lexicon has to do with the role of morphology.
E85-1021.txt,26,The morpheme based conception of the lexicon advocates a dynamic view of morphology_comma_ i.e. a conception according to which words are generated each time anew Hoekstra et al. 1980 .
E85-1021.txt,27,This view contrasts with the static conception of morphology assumed in Jackendoff s word based theory of the lexicon.
E85-1021.txt,28,Interestingly enough_comma_ with the exception of some usually very small systems with no morphology at all_comma_ all the lexicons in computational linguistic projects seem to assume a dynamic conception of morphology.
E85-1021.txt,29,The no morphology option_comma_ which can be viewed as an extreme version of the word based lexicon mentioned above modulo the redundancy rules_comma_ has been adopted mostly for convenience by researchers working on parsers for languages fairly uninteresting from the point of view of morphology_comma_ e.g.
E85-1021.txt,31,It has the non trivial merit of reducing the lexical analysis to a simple dictionary look up.
E85-1021.txt,32,Since all flectional forms of a given word are listed independently_comma_ all the orthographic words must be present in the lexicon.
E85-1021.txt,33,Thus_comma_ this option presents the double advantage of being simple and efficient.
E85-1021.txt,34,The price to pay is fairly high_comma_ though_comma_ in the sense that the resulting lexicon displays an enormous amount of redundancy lexical information relevant for a whole class of morphologically related words has to be duplicated for every member of the class.
E85-1021.txt,35,This duplication of information_comma_ in turn_comma_ makes the task of updating and or deleting lexical entries much more complex than it should be.
E85-1021.txt,36,This option is more seriously flawed than just being redundant and space greedy_comma_ though.
E85-1021.txt,37,By ignoring the obvious fact that words in natural languages do have some internal structure_comma_ may belong to declension or conjugation classes_comma_ but above all that different orthographical words may in fact realize the same grammatical word in different syntactic environments it fails to be descriptively adequate.
E85-1021.txt,38,Interestingly enough_comma_ this inadequacy turns out to have serious consequences.
E85-1021.txt,39,Consider_comma_ for example_comma_ the case of a translation system.
E85-1021.txt,40,Because a lexicon of this exhaustive list type has no way of representing a notion such as lexeme _comma_ it lacks the proper level for lexical transfer.
E85-1021.txt,41,Thus_comma_ if been_comma_ was_comma_ were_comma_ a._m.m and be are treated as independant words_comma_ what should be their translation_comma_ say in French_comma_ especially if we assume that the French lexicon is organized on the same model
E85-1021.txt,42,The point is straightforward there is no way one can give translation equivalents for orthographic words.
E85-1021.txt,43,Lexical transfer can only be made at the more .
E85-1033.txt,1,following paper concerns a general scheme for multilingual text generation_comma_ as opposed to just translation. Our system processes the text as a whole_comma_ from which it extracts a representation of the meaning of the text.
E85-1033.txt,2,From this representation_comma_ a new text is generated_comma_ using a text modei and action ruies.
E85-1033.txt,3,This process is done in six steps word analysis_comma_ sentence analysis using a Functional Grammar_comma_ reference soiving and inference_comma_ construction of the text pattern_comma_ sentence generation_comma_ and word generation.
E85-1033.txt,4,Different kinds of information are used st each step of the process text organization_comma_ syntax_comma_ semantic_comma_ etc. All the knowledge_comma_ as well as the text_comma_ is given in a declarative manner.
E85-1033.txt,5,It is expressed in a single formalism named Functional Oescriptions.
E85-1033.txt,6,It consists of lexical data_comma_ a Functional Grammar_comma_ a knowledge network_comma_ action rules for reference solving and sentence generation_comma_ models of text_comma_ rules of structuration_comma_ and sentence schema.
E85-1033.txt,7,Text representation_comma_ included in the semantic network_comma_ is composed of different kinds of objects not necessarily distinct text organization_comma_ syntactical information_comma_ objects introduced by the discourse_comma_ affirmations on these objects_comma_ and links between these affirmations.
E85-1033.txt,8,I TEXT VERSUS SENTENCES the one hand rearrange a whole sentence in order to respect certain stylistic rules and on the other hand modify the order of these sentences.
E85-1033.txt,9,Some of them may be deleted and others added.
E85-1033.txt,10,In any ease_comma_ in order to be able to generate a coherent text by means of the information extracted from a source text_comma_ it seems most important to us to understand what the text is refering to.
E85-1033.txt,11,We have restricted our scope to economic geography texts_comma_ taken from a French review named ATLASECO.
E85-1033.txt,12,These texts deaI with industry and agriculture_comma_ invoiving reiated concepts growth_comma_ deciine_comma_ production_comma_ economicaI balance... .
E85-1033.txt,13,Our system parses a french text_comma_ integrates its informative content into a knowledge base_comma_ then generates a new text from information extracted from this base.
E85-1033.txt,14,We present in part 2 the text representation used throughout the process.
E85-1033.txt,15,We describe in part 3 the knowledge representation_comma_ based on the functional descriptions.
E85-1033.txt,16,In part 4 _comma_ we briefly describe the different steps of the process.
E85-1033.txt,17,2 TEXT REPRESENTATION A text conveys information by various means.
E85-1033.txt,18,For example_comma_ the order of sentences_comma_ as well as their syntactic structure_comma_ may be significant.
E85-1033.txt,19,The general text representation we use is the same for understanding and structuring.
E85-1033.txt,20,This representation includes the different kinds of information needed for these two processes.
E85-1033.txt,21,Human translation is a complex process whose activities are not yet entirely understood.
E85-1033.txt,22,Generation of text differs from generation of single sentences our work stresses the necessary processing of the text as a whole and restructuring of this text.
E85-1033.txt,23,A translator must on The text is represented by a set of interrelated objects sentences_comma_ words_comma_ semantic objects... .
E85-1033.txt,24,There are five classes of objects_comma_ not necessarily distinct the visible objects_comma_ the syntactic components_comma_ the discursive objects defined later _comma_ the affirmations and the links.
E85-1033.txt,25,226 2.1 Visible Objects Visible objects are chapters_comma_ paragraphs_comma_ sentences_comma_ words and word sequences .
E85-1033.txt,26,They are reiated by positionai iinks_comma_ describing the organization of the text_comma_ as shown by the foIiowing figure TEXT SENTENCE 1 . . r J 5ENTEN En S OB3 1 083 2 083 n OB3 1 083 n fig. i These links reflect the hierarchical organization of the text chapters ... and the dependent relationship of statements order of sentences ... .
E85-1033.txt,27,2.2 Syntactic Components The sentences are represented by means of unordered syntactic cases subject_comma_ determiner... _comma_ linking a component with its subcomponents.
E85-1033.txt,28,For example the big mouse .  body determiner quail fier J I i mouse definite big fig. Z 2.3 Discursive Objects Discursive objects represent the semantic objects or entities introduced by the text.
E85-1033.txt,29,For example The main crop is wheat_comma_ whose production has strongly decreased.
E85-1033.txt,30,This decline has strongly affected the commercial balance. These two constructions correspond to a single discursive object_comma_ which could be calied decrease of the production of wheat The meaning of a sentence is represented by a network of discursive objects.
E85-1033.txt,31,The propositions_comma_ represenLing the discursive objects_comma_ are normalized into an objscLive form.
E85-1033.txt,32,For example Peter met 3ohn  meeting of 3ohn by Peter Mary is ill  illness of Mary .
E85-1033.txt,33,This normalization is very usefui for coreference soiving.
E85-1033.txt,34,The text itself may be a discursive object.
E85-1033.txt,35,Hence_comma_ it is represented by an object which mentions topic_comma_ date and positional links between sentences of text.
E85-1033.txt,36,Ouring the Understanding Process_comma_ this object will be enlarged by new information_comma_ or modified for instance topic may become more explicit .
E85-1033.txt,37,2.4 Affirmations Implicit within the text_comma_ as well as simply introducing objects_comma_ is the evaluation of certain objects.
E85-1033.txt,38,The production is increasing introduces the production and affirms the increase of production .
E85-1033.txt,39,There are various statement values stated positively in discourse _comma_ dubious ... .
E85-1033.txt,40,These values may be given by the author_comma_ a figure_comma_ an economical organization_comma_ etc. 2.5 Links The links are mainly operators and_comma_ or_comma_ because... that correlate the affirmations_comma_ which are die cursive objects or links A because B  A and B_comma_ but C .
E85-1033.txt,41,They reflect internal structure of discourse.
E85-1033.txt,42,For example the production increases but the deficit remains important .
E85-1033.txt,43,During Understanding phase_comma_ Lheir main role is to transmit statement values to the objects they link.
E85-1033.txt,44,The structuring stage isolates argumentative effects of the discourse_comma_ and builds new links possibly the same .
E85-1033.txt,45,The choice of these links is important because they have to be coherently acceptable from the reader point of view.
E85-1033.txt,46,3 KNOM_EDGE REPRESENTATION We use the same representation for all types of knowledge in the system lexical definitions_comma_ grammar rules_comma_ semantic rules_comma_etc. They are given separately in the formalism of functional descriptions and integrated into the knowledge base that is represented by a functional descriptions network.
E85-1033.txt,47,227 The language of functional descriptions comes from the functional grammars DIK 78 _comma_ which is a linguistic formalism that can be reiated to case grammars FILLMORE 68 .
E85-1033.txt,48,Historically_comma_ Kay 81 used functional descriptions as a genecel tool to represent grammars_comma_ independently of any specific linguistic theory_comma_ after which Rousselot 84 then used functional descriptions to represent any kind of knowledge grammar_comma_ semantic rules_comma_ scripts.. in a system of story understanding.
E85-1033.txt,49,We will use DF instead of functional description .
E85-1033.txt,50,A DF may represent any kind of knowledge.
E85-1033.txt,52,The identifiers are not pre defined they may be added or removed in any way.
E85-1033.txt,53,This allows us to put various kinds of information in the same description syntactic_comma_ semantic_comma_ etc. The objects may be other DFB or paths.
E85-1033.txt,54,A path is a notation whose aim is to point to objects that ace already defined .
E85-1033.txt,55,We have two kinds of paths A local path I list of identifier points to an object in the current OF_comma_ as defined by the list of identifiers.
E85-1033.txt,56,For example_comma_ in fig. 3_comma_ the path I actor name cefers to William .
E85-1033.txt,57,A global path_comma_ g starting point list ofidentifiers points to an object in the knowledge base.
E85-1033.txt,58,It is defined in the same way as the local path_comma_ except that the starting point is the curcent DF.
E85-1033.txt,59,The internal representation of a DF is a labelled graph.
E85-1033.txt,60,For example_comma_ the representation of the DF in fig. is shown in fig. 4. as input and converts it directly into the labelled graph as shown in fig. 4_comma_ which is then integrated into the knowiedge base.
E85-1033.txt,61,A functional description network is the graph that represents a set of interlaced DFB_comma_ i.e. the knowledge base.
E85-1033.txt,62,This network is a labelled graph whose nodes correspond to OFs_comma_ and whose links to elementary object properties.
E85-1033.txt,63,These links are labelled with identifiers. colour table  blue object DF property object OF fig. 5 Each identifier e.g. colour may be given different propecties e.g. inhecitance properties .
E85-1033.txt,64,This is done through attaching a node to the identifier.
E85-1033.txt,65,The graph may contain Dynamic Paths _comma_ which allow access to the objects.
E85-1033.txt,66,A dynamic path is a function f starting point list of identifiers whose value is a node on the graph.
E85-1033.txt,67,Foc example_comma_ in fig. 4_comma_ the dynamic path f M actor name points to the node William .
E85-1033.txt,68,Dynamic Paths ace very similar to substituable variables in formal systems.
E85-1033.txt,69,The processing of a DF network can be done at two levels elementary level insert or delete links i.e. propecties or nodes i.e. objects form level each node of the netwock can still be viewed as a description_comma_ which corresponds to a complex set of links.
E85-1033.txt,70,This allows us to work on the form of the objects pattern matching and merging .
E85-1033.txt,71,The main algorithms that operate at the form level are those of compatibility pattern matching and merging.
E85-1033.txt,72,Compatilibity is a boolean function that decides whether two descriptions may correspond to the same object of the real world.
E85-1033.txt,75,The result is a new description_comma_ more complete than either of the originals.
E85-1033.txt,76,For example_comma_ the first two DFs of fig. 7 are compatible_comma_ and give the third one as the result of merging.
E85-1033.txt,77,These two algorithms_comma_ inspired by the functional unification introduced by Kay_comma_ are very powerfuI and are used at each step of text processing.
E85-1033.txt,78,Their precise definitions use mathematicaI transformations of iabeIIed graphs and are given in GROSCOT_comma_ ROUSSELOT 85 .
E85-1033.txt,79,4 TEXT PROCESSING In this section_comma_ we describe the following different steps of the text processing word anaiysis sentence anaIysis reference solving construction of the text pattern sentence generation word generation 4.1 Word Analysis The word analyser uses a knowledge base about the standard inflexions of the initial language and a dictionary of words and sequences of words.
E85-1033.txt,80,Each item in the dictionary contains a semantic definition_comma_ its syntactical category_comma_ and its type of infiexion with its roots.
E85-1033.txt,81,We generate for each word a description of its syntactic features.
E85-1033.txt,82,AII soiutions are generated.
E85-1033.txt,84,It works sentence by sentence and assumes three important functions recognition and construction of syntactic components of a sentencecontroI of semantic constraints generation of the semantic representation of the sentence_comma_ i.e. an affirmation or a link The analyser uses a declarative grammar_comma_ which does not depend upon the way in which the anaiyser works.
E85-1033.txt,85,The grammar is a DF_comma_ in which each identifier object pair represents a grammar ruIe.
E85-1033.txt,86,These rules aliow the analyser to spiita syntactical category into constituents_comma_ to verify the constraints_comma_ and to build the associated semantic representation.
E85-1033.txt,87,The analyser works in a top down manner by means of an agenda which allows the separation of the controls.
E85-1033.txt,88,Also included in the anaIyser is a graph that contains the partiaI anaiysis which minimizes processing time during the backtracks.
E85-1033.txt,89,The starting point of this analyser is the set of DFs which have been obtained and graphed after word analysis.
E85-1033.txt,91,The process uses action rules_comma_ written by means of OFs.
E85-1033.txt,92,The rules interpreter works in a lazy saturation mode It locally saturates the knowledge base regardless of whether or not all inferences have been made.
E85-1033.txt,93,The process has three main features it is directed by the syntax definite articles_comma_ pronouns.. it identifies the objects at the semantic level_comma_ by testing the compatibility of discursive objectsit uses positional links to define the possible references in each case.
E85-1033.txt,94,For example_comma_ a demonstrative pronoun has to be found among the preceding objects of the text It has two important effects it constructs a coherent network of discursive objects the meaning of the text it integrates the text into the knowledge base each time that the text refers to a known object_comma_ links are created from this object to the text When this is done_comma_ the position of the information_comma_ may be inadequate for a coherent text.
E85-1033.txt,95,Therefore_comma_ the text structure is changed some information is enhanced the paragraphs are balanced the information is reordered according to chronological order and significance at the deepest level of the text structure.
E85-1033.txt,96,At this step_comma_ output text structure is clearly apparent.
E85-1033.txt,97,But it is not sufficient because the text has now become a sequence of unrelated statements.
E85-1033.txt,98,Links are then created between the discursive objects introduced in the text conjunctions_comma_ pronouns... and ellipses are used to avoid repetitions.
E85-1033.txt,99,4.5 Sentence Generation From each OF of the text describing output information_comma_ this stage generates the description of a suitable sentence.
E85-1033.txt,100,Syntactic patterns are associated with concepts evolutions_comma_ appreciations_comma_ numbers... .
E85-1033.txt,101,Action ruIes combine these patterns to create the description of a sentence_comma_ i.e. a iist of word descriptions.
E85-1033.txt,102,4.4 Construction of the text pattern Once the initial text has been analysed_comma_ its informative content is integrated in the knowledge base_comma_ thereby making it possible to question this base and to reformulate the soobtained information with the aim of generating a new text.
E85-1033.txt,103,This stage builds the text structure paragraphs_comma_ sub paragraphs_comma_ sentences... using two complementary approaches the content of information and the evoIution of the visible structure of the text.
E85-1033.txt,104,Indeed_comma_ text generation is a refIective process generation of a singIe sentence of the text must take account the preceding and following text.
E85-1033.txt,105,All the processes used for structuring are written by means of rules.
E85-1033.txt,106,The starting point of structuring is a set of information extracted from the knowledge network.
E85-1033.txt,107,First_comma_ all the information is inserted into a text model by means of their topics.
E85-1033.txt,108,Some obvious redundancies are eliminated only one occurrence will be kept_comma_ in the most appropriate place.
E85-1033.txt,109,A.6 Word Generation Word generation uses the same organization of the knowledge base about standard inflexions as word anaiysis.
E85-1033.txt,110,From a list of word descriptions_comma_ inciuding syntactic features_comma_ the system constructs the output word.
E85-1033.txt,111,For example word burn cat verb tense present person   B U R N S number singula d fig. i0 .5 ANALYSING ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY TEXTS The texts we have analysed_comma_ taken from the French review ATLASECO_comma_ describe the main features of the agriculture in different countries.
E85-1033.txt,112,They contain an average of 20 sentences_comma_ which contain from i0 to 45 words.
E85-1033.txt,113,230 The system used 400 lexical items_comma_ which represent 2400 words 70 grammar ruies a semantic network containing 220 concepts_comma_ 80 of them being domain dependant 80 semantic ruIes for inference and reference solving i text model_comma_ containing 50 paragraphs and subparagraphs lO0 rules for text structuring 30 sentence patterns for generation Our system was able to extract the significant information that such a text conveys_comma_ and produce a new text from this information.
E85-1033.txt,114,As a matter of convenience_comma_ we used French as the target language for validation_comma_ however the process described here should also be able to work in a manner independant of the target language_comma_ by chaining certain parts of the knowledge base.
E85-1033.txt,115,Now_comma_ we are in the process of adapting our system to generate French appliance operation manuals from the corresponding ones. references ATLASECO Atlas dconomique mondial Le Nouvel Observateur_comma_ 1982.

E85-1011.txt,1,introduce several general notions concerning the texts and the particularities of text processing on a computer support_comma_ in relation to some problems which are specific to M A T. And we present the solution we have proposed for the duration of the EUROTRA project. .
E85-1011.txt,2,The input output modules are very important for a machine aided translation system M A T _comma_ which must be integrated into some environment translation office_comma_ technical data base_comma_ etc. .
E85-1011.txt,3,From an external point of view_comma_ the support of a text is either paper with figures_comma_ formulas_comma_ tables and typographical conventions_comma_ or a magnetic support containing_comma_ in addition_comma_ formatting and page setting commands for a special text processing system.
E85-1011.txt,4,Within all modern M A T systems_comma_ including EUROTRA now in the specification phase _comma_ a text is viewed_comma_ from an IJt point of view_comma_ as a set of decorated nodes_comma_ organized according to a particular geometrical distribution often a tree structure_comma_ as in ARIANE 78 Boitet et al._comma_ 1982 .
E85-1011.txt,5,Our objective in proposing some representations of texts for EUROTRA has been to define an internal structure recognized by the EUROTRA software systems_comma_ and carrying all information necessary for the translation model and for the restitution of the preceding information at output time.
E85-1011.txt,6,TEXT PROCESSING IN GENERAL Each text whether or not on computer support is considered from three points of view_comma_ i.e. IThis work has been carried out as part of a contracCwith the Commission of the European Communities in the framework of the EUROTRA Research and Development programme and the CNRS Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique .
E85-1011.txt,7,The ideas and proposals in this paper are those of the authors and not necessarily shared or supported by the Commission_comma_ nor are they to be interpreted as part of the EUROTRA design.
E85-1011.txt,8,We are grateful to the Commission and the CNRS for agreement to publish this paper.
E85-1011.txt,9,73 The Fopu is everything related to the particuLar external aspect of a text on paper.
E85-1011.txt,10,E.g._comma_ the fact that it is written in one or several columns_comma_ single or double spaced_comma_ printed recto or recto verso_comma_ following a special convention for the numbering of chapters and sections_comma_ etc. The JC p. j E is the logical division of the text into hierarchically related pieces such as volume_comma_ part_comma_ chapter_comma_ section_comma_ sub section_comma_ paragraph_comma_ sub paragraph_comma_ sentence_comma_ numbered or non numbered lists_comma_ figures_comma_ tables_comma_ diagrams_comma_ etc. This depends on the kind of text when processing plays_comma_ getting rid or their devision into acts and scenes is out of the question.
E85-1011.txt,11,When poetry is processed_comma_ the delimitation of each line cannot be left out.
E85-1011.txt,12,The structure can be externally represented by using various po E forms.
E85-1011.txt,13,In the context of M A T_comma_ th advantages of taking into account the structure of the text are twofold the text can be decomposed if only part of it is to be translated it is easy to retrieve a piece of text e.g. when the translation of a long text has failed on one sentence .
E85-1011.txt,14,The ConJ JIJ is the text considered as a sequence of words carrying some information.
E85-1011.txt,15,Words in different languages may appear_comma_ written with special characters_comma_ in upper lower case_comma_ diacritics_comma_ punctuation marks_comma_ stress_comma_ etc. These three notions are interrelated.
E85-1011.txt,16,The content of a text can_comma_ for example_comma_ refer to a page number_comma_ which belongs rather to its form.
E85-1011.txt,17,Often_comma_ the length of tb original text is not maintained in the translation_comma_ and this_comma_ therefore_comma_ modifies the form.
E85-1011.txt,18,In text processing systems_comma_ a coding either visible or invisible to the user enables to express the three above mentioned characteristics of the text.
E85-1011.txt,19,We will call o a L the codes related to the form_comma_ and epoJ o the codes related to the structure.
E85-1011.txt,20,We distinguish four main features of the formattors some examples can be found in Furuta et al._comma_ 1982 Chamberlin et al._comma_ 1981 Goldfarb_comma_ 1981 IBM_comma_ 1981_comma_ 1983 Stallman_comma_ 1981 Thacker et al._comma_ 1979 .
E85-1011.txt,22,dP. JZy .z J JJ JZJt in the delayed case_comma_ there is no interaction with the author and any local modification of the document can only be carried out after a complete reformatting of the text.
E85-1011.txt,23,In the immediate case_comma_ the author can immediately see the effect of any modification on the formatting of the document.
E85-1011.txt,24,2. OlCt.y J3 OJ tP.Xt systems able to process pictures and text are associated with addressable dot printers or with photocomposition machines.
E85-1011.txt,26,mll0PJt Lt_comma_ ve dP. .t t v in an imperative system_comma_ the user uses formatting commands written in a low level language .sp 2 to skip two blanks_comma_... .
E85-1011.txt,27,In a declarative system_comma_ a high level language enables the typing of the different parts of the text_comma_ without bothering about the specific result obtained on a specific physical support.
E85-1011.txt,29,iJ q 3 q e  depending on the system_comma_ several objects can represent a text.
E85-1011.txt,30,When structure and content are mixed in each object_comma_ the coding is called integrated_comma_ otherwise it is called separated.
E85-1011.txt,31,Let us take the following text as an example I ml .sp 2 US on Avant dernier exempLe us off  est il Je ne sais pas. Par_comma_ i_comma_ tout fait Non... enfin je ne trois pas... Bon_comma_ dit il.
E85-1011.txt,32,Il a raison.  Oh. Rochefort In that case_comma_ the format_comma_or is of delayed_comma_ text only_comma_ imperative_comma_ and integrated type.
E85-1011.txt,33,The form depends on the formats and on their parameters .sp 2_comma_ .us on off .
E85-1011.txt,34,The structure depends on the punctuation  _comma_ ... _comma_  ... _comma_ and on some formats.
E85-1011.txt,35,In the context of M A T systems_comma_ some decisions must be taken_comma_ as to how a text is decomposed at input time into segments_comma_ units_comma_ words_comma_ separators_comma_ punctuation_comma_ etc. To create this structure and carry out the decomposition of the text in a system with integrated coding_comma_ it suffices to introduce special codes or to use existing codes_comma_ like end of text_comma_ formats... to mark the text and to generate the object structure automatically from their interpretation.
E85-1011.txt,36,In order to do so_comma_ the system must know the list of separators as well as their hierarchical ordering how the formats for page setting are handled.
E85-1011.txt,37,These formats are almost always linguistically relevant.
E85-1011.txt,38,For example_comma_ titles form a particular sublanguage.
E85-1011.txt,39,Hence_comma_ a title format may be used by the analyzer to use an appropriate subgramma how alphabetical transcriptions are carried out.
E85-1011.txt,40,No coding standards exist for all language although ISO codes and transcriptions ISO_comma_ 1983 have been defined how the plates are handled.
E85-1011.txt,41,Figures_comma_ formulas_comma_ etc._comma_ may be completely Left out_comma_ or replaced by special words _comma_ or left in the text.
E85-1011.txt,42,This Last method implies the use of some formal language for figure description_comma_ which must be handled by thelinguistic processor.
E85-1011.txt,43,WHAT COULD BE DONE IN EUROTRA
E85-1011.txt,44,Our proposals are based on our experience with GETA s ARIANE 78 system Boitet et aL._comma_ 1982 _comma_ but also on some others approaches Morin_comma_ 1978 Bennett et al._comma_ 1984 Hawes_comma_ 1983 Hundt_comma_ 1982 .
E85-1011.txt,45,We have proposed thattaLL along the transLation process_comma_ a given text is kept together with the attributes defining its three aspects content_comma_ form and structure.
E85-1011.txt,46,This solution seems more interesting_comma_ because all information related to the text is kept.
E85-1011.txt,47,Hence_comma_ it is possible to write linguistic processes in such a way that the output text will present the same o as the input text.
E85-1011.txt,48,No complex and often not good enough restitution program is necessary.
E85-1011.txt,49,Moreover_comma_ many codes formats_comma_ separators... have a linguistic relevance which the Linguists might wish to put to profit.
E85-1011.txt,50,The second idea is to choose a unique and unambiguous internal representation for each character each symbol of each processed language including the special symbols such as _comma_  .o. should be represented by a unique internal code.
E85-1011.txt,51,This obviously has great advantages_comma_ for example the ease of transfer of linguistic applications.
E85-1011.txt,52,One of the basic principles underlying this proposal is_comma_ therefore_comma_  zp X o X h J V LOrlm tl_comma_t . We wish to work directly on real texts_comma_ without being obliged to put them in some form or other prior to process them into the system. Manual pre editing will be reduced to a minimum. We wish to access objects in a way which allows to indicate the text processing system used for the definition of formats and separators _comma_ and the input output device used for entering the text.
E85-1011.txt,53,The proposed solution calls for hJc e _comma_ the content and use of which we will now describe.
E85-1011.txt,54,These tables not necessarily disjoint correspond to the three Levels of form_comma_ structure and content.
E85-1011.txt,55,The order in which they are described corresponds to the advised order of use.
E85-1011.txt,56,74 The tables should be used to drive the so called input output module or conversion module .
E85-1011.txt,57,Transcription The transcription table allows the conversion of a text entered on any device whatsoever_comma_ into an equivalent text in the same language .
E85-1011.txt,58,This table_comma_ therefore_comma_ would depend on the input output device used.
E85-1011.txt,59,For reasons of generality and portability_comma_ the ISO code seems to be the best choice for the internal code.
E85-1011.txt,60,Each alphabet would be identified in a unambiguous way by a corresponding escape sequence.
E85-1011.txt,61,In addition_comma_ we propose to assign to each alphabet a language code to define two escape codes for the two possible modes of representing a character 2 bytes and 1 byte.
E85-1011.txt,62,We think it would be best to choose for each Language a standard which respects its alphabetical order.
E85-1011.txt,63,At the Level of the internal code_comma_ the transliteration problem does not exist as this code is supposed to contain all the symbols used.
E85-1011.txt,64,However_comma_ we propose to use factorization of the alphabet code only for storage and to keep the 2 bytes code during the whole processing.
E85-1011.txt,65,This conversion can easily be carried out with the use of an equivalence table called XYt p onX zbZE.
E85-1011.txt,66,In general_comma_ there will be one table for each input output device and for each language.
E85-1011.txt,67,The table would function as follows at input time in the first column_comma_ recognition of the current sy ol of the text_comma_ and transformation of this symbol into the corresponding element in accordance with the storage mode_comma_ i.e. adding or not the language code _comma_ in the second column.
E85-1011.txt,68,This table enables us to unify the writing conventions of the text and_comma_ in a more general way_comma_ would be used for all input output communication between the system and a human partner.
E85-1011.txt,69,In this table_comma_ we also indicate the alphabetical order of each Language.
E85-1011.txt,70,Each Language has its own characteristics in French_comma_ for example_comma_ dictionaries are sorted according to the Letters of the alphabet_comma_ and then according to the diacritics.
E85-1011.txt,71,In order to take all these possibilities into account_comma_ we propose to add a series of columns to this transcription table sorting would be carried out in several phases chosen in advance.
E85-1011.txt,72,Let us assume that French text is entered on an English keyboard the absence of diacritics oblige to define transcription rules.
E85-1011.txt,73,The table of transcription would be as follows the codes are fictitious Human Internal ALphabetic Diacritic transcription code order order e e 1 e 2 u I i i i j1 2 3 2 Formats We attempt to define a means of specifying all the characteristics necessary for the recognition of formats on a wide range of formattors and text processing systems.
E85-1011.txt,74,But we may assume that_comma_ independently of the formattor chosen_comma_ there will be a codification standard for texts which limits the number of possibilities and simplifies entry.
E85-1011.txt,75,In general_comma_ this stage will have three phases the first phase is strictly computational_comma_ the next two are of a linguistic nature _comma_ each of which is the object of different information data_comma_ stored in the table of formats recognition of the format features of formats must be coded in some fields of the table initialization of associated decorations properties and values _comma_ which will characterize it all along the linguistic processing.
E85-1011.txt,76,The linguist should envisage its definition and its use in a way which is coherent with the linguistic models.
E85-1011.txt,77,Freedom of choice of properties and values to be assigned to each format should be Left to him. transformation of the recognized format in a string.
E85-1011.txt,78,The interest of this string lies in the fact that it can serve to mark different formatting orders which express the same action_comma_ in a way which is unique.
E85-1011.txt,79,Similar formats will_comma_ then_comma_ be unified by one single convention which is defined by the linguist.
E85-1011.txt,80,The model grammars and dictionaries would not depend on a particular formatting system.
E85-1011.txt,81,A change of formattor would_comma_ therefore_comma_ not be felt at the level of the linguistic data.
E85-1011.txt,82,75 For the example given above_comma_ the table would be as follows Prefix .sp .US on .us off Search Zone C.Begin C.End 1 1 1 1 1 1 End of format Leng.
E85-1011.txt,83,Stop chr End Line 133 YES 133 YES 133 YES oe.
E85-1011.txt,84,Param YES NO NO Occurrence type format string PARAGRAPH BEG UNDERLINED underscore END UNDERLINED age Structural separators Once the text is in EUROTRA code and decomposed into formats and non formats _comma_ we identify its structure.
E85-1011.txt,85,To that end_comma_ we use a table of structural separators.
E85-1011.txt,86,A 6Ephor is a string of characters to be found either in the formats or in the other occurrences.
E85-1011.txt,87,It can correspond to a punctuation sign_comma_ a word separator not necessarily blank or space _comma_ etc. For a format_comma_ it is proposed to use its characteristics_comma_ as given by the properties and values assigned in the previous table and not the string of characters which enabled its recognition.
E85-1011.txt,88,In this table_comma_ the separators should have a hierarchical order.
E85-1011.txt,89,Therefore_comma_ both the LEv of a separator is defined and its place in the hierarchy_comma_ the highest possible level being 1.
E85-1011.txt,90,The formats not found in the table will be taken by default as separators of the lowest level.
E85-1011.txt,91,For the example given in the first part_comma_ we can define the below table the represents a blank or a space. The transcriptions are not taken into account .
E85-1011.txt,92,The fact that certain symbols are followed by one or two blanks in order to distinguish their level_comma_ could give the impression that this is the result of pre editing.
E85-1011.txt,93,But this is not the case
E85-1011.txt,94,In this example_comma_ we have only use a text which follows precise and strict conventions in typography_comma_ as is the case for a great number of real texts.
E85-1011.txt,95,Our proposal can also apply to the processing of texts which have no precise conventions.
E85-1011.txt,96,It suffices to define the tables in an appropriate way.
E85-1011.txt,97,Format separator Level yes no PARAGRAPH 1 NO i 2 NO 2 NO . 2 NO 3 NO 4 NO 5 NO i 5 No 6 YES 6 YES 6 NO 6 NO BEG UNDERLI.
E85-1011.txt,98,7 YES END UNDERLZ.
E85-1011.txt,99,7 NO 8 NO 9 NO . 9 NO aaa Nesting format start yes no END UNDERLI. OCCURRENCE DELETE TYPE CONTENT NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO YES NO NO EXCLAMATION QUESTION SENTENCE COLON HYPHEN WORD WORD B ZNVERTED COMMAS B PARENTHESES E INVERTED COMMAS E PARENTHESES m WORD HYPHEN FULL STOP As for the formats_comma_ we propose to add to this table properties and values for the recognized separators.
E85-1011.txt,100,We should be able to define the properties and values to be assigned to the simple occurrences not found in the table and to indicate whether the separator_comma_ once it is recognized_comma_ should be kept or not blanks_comma_ for example .
E85-1011.txt,101,The next tree is the result of the application of the three tables given above to our example text.
E85-1011.txt,102,Each Leaf carries the properties and values given by the tables.
E85-1011.txt,103,The property OCCURRENCE contains the character string indicated.
E85-1011.txt,104,The TYPE of the nodes 2_comma_ 5 and 14 is FORMAT.
E85-1011.txt,105,The type of all other Leaves is CONTENT.
E85-1011.txt,106,76 We have the choice between building up the tree considered_comma_ and building up a list of nodes each of which correspond to a Leaf of the tree.
E85-1011.txt,107,Maybe the linguist should be able to choose by means of a parameter.
E85-1011.txt,108,In the build up of a tree_comma_ it would be interesting to assign the properties and values of the highest priority separator found amongs its daughters to the internal nodes.
E85-1011.txt,109,Node 1 would thus have the value PARAGRAPH and node 17 the value EXCLAMATION.
E85-1031.txt,1,paper examines some of the characteristic features of natural language interaction with a database system and its implications for the processing of singular definite descriptions. Some proposals are made for assessing the uniqueness claim of the singular definite article in the context of retrieval from a relational database.
E85-1031.txt,2,Other standard assumptions such as the extensional evaluation and referent evaluation exclusively in the database rather than within the discourse model are critically examined. .
E85-1031.txt,3,A comprehensive treatment of the phenomenon of singular definite description in natural language processing constitutes a research program par excellence in the field of cognitive science.
E85-1031.txt,4,Not only does it involve the various cognitive disciplines but also the integration of the traditional levels of analysis_comma_ namely the syntactic_comma_ semantic and pragmatic levels as well as including a performance or processing level dealing with mechanisms for memory managment of referring expressions.

E95-1022.txt,1,are two main methodologies for constructing the knowledge base of a natural language analyser the linguistic and the data driven. Recent state ofthe art part of speech taggers are based on the data driven approach.
E95-1022.txt,2,Because of the known feasibility of the linguistic rule based approach at related levels of description_comma_ the success of the datadriven approach in part of speech analysis may appear surprising.
E95-1022.txt,3,In this paper_comma_ a case is made for the syntactic nature of part of speech tagging.
E95-1022.txt,4,A new tagger of English that uses only linguistic distributional rules is outlined and empirically evaluated.

E95-1016.txt,5,In recent years there has been a common agreement in the NLP research community on the importance of having an extensive coverage of selectional restrictions SRs tuned to the domain to work with.
E95-1016.txt,6,SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation.
E95-1016.txt,7,SRs may have different applications in NLP_comma_ specifically_comma_ they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection WSS_comma_ as in Hirst_comma_ 1987 _comma_ with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones Whittemore et al._comma_ 1990 and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement Basili et al._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1016.txt,8,Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work Levin_comma_ 1992 .

E95-1016.txt,39,In this section we summarize the results and conclusions reached in that paper.
E95-1016.txt,40,For instance_comma_ table 1 shows the SRs acquired for the subject position of the verb seek.
E95-1016.txt,41,Type indicates a manual diagnosis about the class appropriateness Ok correct Abs over generalization Senses due to erroneous senses .
E95-1016.txt,42,Assoc corresponds to the association score higher values appear first .
E95-1016.txt,43,Most of the induced classes are due to incorrect senses.
E95-1016.txt,44,Thus_comma_ although suit was used in the WSJ articles only in the sense of legal_action _comma_ the algorithm not only considered the other senses as well suit_comma_ suing _comma_ aResnik 1992 and Ribas 1994a used equation 1 without introducing normalization.
E95-1016.txt,45,Therefore_comma_ the estimated function didn t accomplish probability axioms.
E95-1016.txt,46,Nevertheless_comma_ their results should be equivalent for our purposes to those introducing normalization because it shouldn t affect the relative ordering of Assoc among rival candidate classes for the same v_comma_ s .
E95-1016.txt,47,113 suit_of_clothes _comma_ sugt _comma_ but the Assoc score ranked them higher than the appropriate sense.
E95-1016.txt,48,We can also notice that the l Abs class_comma_ group _comma_ seems too general for the example nouns_comma_ while one of its daughters_comma_ people seems to fit the data much better.
E95-1016.txt,49,Analyzing the results obtained from different experimental evaluation methods_comma_ Ribas 1994a drew up some conclusions a.
E95-1016.txt,50,The technique achieves a good coverage. b.
E95-1016.txt,51,Most of the classes acquired result from the accumulation of incorrect senses.
E95-1016.txt,53,No clear co relation between Assoc and the manual diagnosis is found. d.
E95-1016.txt,54,A slight tendency to over generalization exists due to incorrect senses.
E95-1016.txt,55,Although the performance of the presented technique seems to be quite good_comma_ we think that some of the detected flaws could possibly be addressed.
E95-1016.txt,56,Noise due to polysemy of the nouns involved seems to be the main obstacle for the practicality of the technique.
E95-1016.txt,57,It makes the association score prefer incorrect classes and jump on overgeneralizations.
E95-1016.txt,58,In this paper we are interested in exploring various ways to make the technique more robust to noise_comma_ namely_comma_ a to experiment with variations of the association score_comma_ b to experiment with thresholding.
E95-1016.txt,59,3 Variations on the association statistical measure In this section we consider different variations on the association score in order to make it more robust.
E95-1016.txt,60,The different techniques are experimentally evaluated in section 4.2.
E95-1016.txt,61,3.1 Variations on the prior probability When considering the prior probability_comma_ the more independent of the context it is the better to measure actual associations.
E95-1016.txt,62,A sensible modification of the measure would be to consider p c as the prior distribution Assoc v_comma_s_comma_c p c_comma_v_comma_s logP  s Using the chain rule on mutual information Cover and Thomas_comma_ 1991_comma_ p. 22 we can mathematically relate the different versions of Assoc_comma_ mssoc v_comma_ s_comma_ c p clv_comma_ s log Assoc v_comma_ s_comma_ c The first advantage of Assoc would come from this information theoretical relationship.
E95-1016.txt,63,Specifically_comma_ the AssoF takes into account the preference selection of syntactic positions for particular classes.
E95-1016.txt,64,In intuitive terms_comma_ typical subjects e.g. person_comma_ individual_comma_ ... would be preferred to atypical subjects as suit_of_clothes as SRs on the subject in contrast to Assoc.
E95-1016.txt,65,The second advantage is that as long as the prior probabilities_comma_ p c _comma_ involve simpler events than those used in Assoc_comma_ p cls _comma_ the estimation is easier and more accurate ameliorating data sparseness .
E95-1016.txt,66,A subsequent modification would be to estimate the prior_comma_ p c _comma_ from the counts of all the nouns appearing in the corpus independently of their syntactic positions not restricted to be heads of verbal complements .
E95-1016.txt,67,In this way_comma_ the estimation of p c would be easier and more accurate.
E95-1016.txt,68,3.2 Estimating class probabilities from noun frequencies In the global weighting technique presented in equation 2 very polysemous nouns provide the same amount of evidence to every sense as nonambiguous nouns do while less ambiguous nouns could be more informative about the correct classes as long as they do not carry ambiguity.
E95-1016.txt,69,The weight introduced in 1 could alternatively be found in a local manner_comma_ in such a way that more polysemous nouns would give less evidence to each one of their senses than less ambiguous ones.
E95-1016.txt,70,Local weight could be obtained using p cJn .
E95-1016.txt,71,Nevertheless_comma_ a good estimation of this probability seems quite problematic because of the lack of tagged training material.
E95-1016.txt,72,In absence of a better estimator we use a rather poor one as the uniform distribution_comma_ c  cln e el Is _comma__comma_ses _comma__comma_ l Resnik 1993 also uses a local normalization technique but he normalizes by the total number of classes in the hierarchy.
E95-1016.txt,73,This scheme seems to present two problematic features see Ribas_comma_ 1994b for more details .
E95-1016.txt,74,First_comma_ it doesn t take dependency relationships introduced by hyperonymy into account.
E95-1016.txt,75,Second_comma_ nouns categorized in lower levels in the taxonomy provide less weight to each class than higher nouns.
E95-1016.txt,76,3.3 Other statistical measures to score SRs In this section we propose the application of other measures apart from Assoc for learning SRs loglikelihood ratio Dunning_comma_ 1993 _comma_ relative entropy Cover and Thomas_comma_ 1991 _comma_ mutual information ratio Church and Hanks_comma_ 1990 _comma_ 2 Gale and Church_comma_ 1991 .
E95-1016.txt,77,In section 4 their experimental evaluation is presented.
E95-1016.txt,78,The statistical measures used to detect associations on the distribution defined by two random variables X and Y work by measuring the deviation of the conditional distribution_comma_ P XJY _comma_ from the expected distribution if both variables were considered independent_comma_ i.e. the marginal distribution_comma_ P X .
E95-1016.txt,79,If P X is a good approximation 114 e v_s p clv s v_s p cl .v_s p c C p clv p _comma_cl _comma_v s p c Table 2 Conditional and marginal distributions of P XIY _comma_ association measures should be low near zero _comma_ otherwise deviating significantly from zero.
E95-1016.txt,80,Table 2 shows the cross table formed by the conditional and marginal distributions in the case of X e_comma_ e and Y v_s_comma_ _comma_v_s .
E95-1016.txt,81,Different association measures use the information provided in the cross table to different extents.
E95-1037.txt,1,paper proposes a corpus based language model for topic identification. We analyze the association of noun noun and noun verb pairs in LOB Corpus.
E95-1037.txt,2,The word association norms are based on three factors 1 word importance_comma_ 2 pair co occurrence_comma_ and 3 distance.
E95-1037.txt,3,They are trained on the paragraph and sentence levels for noun noun and nounverb pairs_comma_ respectively.
E95-1037.txt,4,Under the topic coherence postulation_comma_ the nouns that have the strongest connectivities with the other nouns and verbs in the discourse form the preferred topic set.
E95-1037.txt,5,The collocational semantics then is used to identify the topics from paragraphs and to discuss the topic shift phenomenon among paragraphs.
E95-1037.txt,7,Although only speakers and writers instead of texts have topics Brown and Yule_comma_ 1983_comma_ p. 68 _comma_ natural language researchers always want to identify a topic or a set of possible topics from a discourse for further applications_comma_ such as anaphora resolution_comma_ information retrieval and so on.
E95-1037.txt,8,This paper adopts a corpus based approach to process discourse information.
E95-1037.txt,9,We postulate that 1 Topic is coherent and has strong relationships with the events in the discourse.
E95-1037.txt,10,Now_comma_ consider the following example quoted from the Lancaster Oslo Bergen LOB Corpus Johansson_comma_ 1986 .
E95-1037.txt,11,The topics in this example are problem and dislocation .
E95-1037.txt,12,The two words are more strongly related to the verbs explain _comma_ fell _comma_ placing and suppose and nouns theories _comma_ explanations _comma_ roll _comma_ codex _comma_ disorder _comma_ order _comma_ disturbance and upheaval .
E95-1037.txt,13,There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations.
E95-1037.txt,14,The present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident prone history.
E95-1037.txt,15,The original was written on a roll_comma_ or codex_comma_ which fell into disorder or was accidentally damaged.
E95-1037.txt,16,An editor_comma_ who was not the author_comma_ made what he could of the chaos by placing the fragments_comma_ or sheets_comma_ or pages_comma_ in order.
E95-1037.txt,17,Most of those who expound a theory of textual dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was written entirely by one author before the disturbance took place but a few leave it open to suppose that the original book had been revised even before the upheaval.
E95-1037.txt,18,We also postulate that 2 Noun verb is a predicate argument relationship on the sentence level and noun noun relationship is associated on discourse level.
E95-1037.txt,19,The postulation 2 could be also observed from the above example.
E95-1037.txt,20,These relationships may be represented implicitly by collocational semantics.
E95-1037.txt,21,Collocation has been applied successfully to many possible applications Church et al. _comma_ 1989 _comma_ e.g_comma_ lexicography Church and Hanks_comma_ 1990 _comma_ information retrieval Salton_comma_ 1986a _comma_ text input Yamashina and Obashi_comma_ 1988 _comma_ etc. This paper will touch on its feasibility in topic identification.
E95-1037.txt,22,This paper is organized as follows.
E95-1037.txt,23,Section 2 presents a corpus based language model and discuss how to train this model.
E95-1037.txt,24,Section 3 touches on topic identification in discourse.
E95-1037.txt,25,Section 4 shows a series of experiments based on the proposed model and discusses the results.
E95-1037.txt,26,Section 5 gives short remarks.
E95-1037.txt,27,2 A Language Model Brown and Yue 1983 pointed out there are two kinds of topics one is sentence topic and the other is discourse topic.
E95-1037.txt,28,The discourse topic is usually the form of topic sentence.
E95-1037.txt,29,We postulate_comma_ further_comma_ that the noun in the topic sentence play important roles in the whole discourse.
E95-1037.txt,30,Thus nouns play the core part in the underlying language model.
E95-1037.txt,31,The associations of a noun with other nouns and verbs are supporting factors for it to be a topic.
E95-1037.txt,32,267 The importance of a specific verb or noun is defined by Inverse Document Frequency IDF Salton_comma_ 1986b IDF W log P O W  O W  c 1 where P is the number of documents in LOB Corpus_comma_ i.e.
E95-1037.txt,33,500_comma_ O I4 is the number of documents with word W_comma_ and c is a threshold value.
E95-1037.txt,34,LOB Corpus is a million word collection of present day British English texts.
E95-1037.txt,35,It contains 500 texts of approximately 2_comma_000 words distributed over 15 text categories Johansson_comma_ 1986 .
E95-1037.txt,36,These categories include reportage_comma_ editorial_comma_ reviews_comma_ religion_comma_ skills_comma_ trades_comma_ popular lore_comma_ belles lettres_comma_ biography_comma_ essays_comma_ learned and scientific writings_comma_ fictions_comma_ humour_comma_ adventure and western fiction_comma_ love story_comma_ etc. That is to say_comma_ LOB Corpus is a balanced corpus.
E95-1037.txt,37,The tag set of LOB Corpus is based on the philosophy of that of Brown Corpus Francis and Kucera_comma_ 1979 _comma_ but some modifications are made.
E95-1037.txt,38,This is to achieve greater delicacy_comma_ while preserving comparability with the Brown Corpus.
E95-1037.txt,39,Those words that appear more than one haft of the documents in LOB Corpus have negative log P. O W O W shown below.
E95-1037.txt,40,Noun Verb time 3.68 way 1.92 year 1.71 man 1.47 day 1.12 part 0.76 people 0.75 thing 0.73 hand 0.54 life 0.51 fact 0.40 place 0.40 work 0.35 end 0.12 case 0.09 point 0.05 make 5.01 take 3.56 give 2.95 come 2.45 find 2.30 see 2.26 know 2.20 say 2.18 go 2.11 seem l.30 show l.20 think l.18 use 1.07 get l.06 become 0.95 bring 0.73 put 0.68 leave 0.62 1ook 0.48 call 0.43 tell 0.41 keep 0.32 hold 0.18 ask 0.23 begin 0.08 The threshold values for nouns and verbs are set to 0.77 and 2.46 respectively.
E95-1037.txt,41,The two values are used to screen out the unimportant words_comma_ whose 1DF values are negative.
E95-1037.txt,42,That is_comma_ their 1DF values are reset to zero.
E95-1037.txt,43,The strength of one occurrence of a verb noun pair or a noun noun pair is computed by the importance of the words and their distances SNV N _comma_  IDF N .IDF V I D N _comma_Vj 2 SNN N _comma_ Nk IDF N .IDF Nk D N _comma_ Nk 3 where SNV denotes the strength of a noun verb pair_comma_ SNN the strength of a noun noun pair_comma_ and D X_comma_Y represents the distance between X and Y.
E95-1037.txt,44,When i equals to k_comma_ the SNN Ni_comma_Nk is set to zero.
E95-1037.txt,45,Including the distance factor is motivated by the fact that the related events are usually located in the same texthood.
E95-1037.txt,46,This is the spatial locality of events in a discourse.
E95-1037.txt,47,The distance is measured by the difference between cardinal numbers of two words.
E95-1037.txt,48,We assign a cardinal number to each verb and noun in sentences.
E95-1037.txt,49,The cardinal numbers are kept continuous across sentences in the same paragraph.
E95-1037.txt,50,For example_comma_ With so many problems 1 to solve2_comma_ it would be a great helP3 to select 4 some one problem 5 which might be the key 6 to all the others_comma_ and begin 7 there.
E95-1037.txt,51,If there is any such keyproblem 8_comma_ then it is undoubtedly the problem 9 of the unitYlo of the Gospelll.
E95-1037.txt,52,There are three viewsl2 of the Fourth Gospell3 which have been held14.
E95-1037.txt,53,Therefore_comma_ the cardinal number of problems_comma_ C problems _comma_ equals to 1 and C held is 14.
E95-1037.txt,54,The distance can be defined to be D Z_comma_Y abs C X C Y  4 The association norms of verb noun and noun noun pairs are summation of the strengths of all their occurrences in the corpus ANV Nj_comma_ V  Z SNV Ni Vs 5 ANN Ni_comma_ N k Z SNN N _comma_ N k 6 where ANV denotes the association norm of a nounverb pair_comma_ and ANN the association norm of a nounnoun pair.
E95-1037.txt,55,The less frequent word has a higher IDF value so that the strength SNV and SNN of one occurrence may be larger.
E95-1037.txt,56,However_comma_ the number of terms to be summed is smaller.
E95-1037.txt,57,Thus_comma_ the formulae IDF and ANV ANN are complementary.
E95-1037.txt,58,LOB Corpus of approximately one million words is used to train the basic association norms.
E95-1037.txt,59,They are based on different levels the paragraph and sentence levels for noun noun and noun verb pairs respectively.
E95-1037.txt,60,Table 1 shows the statistics of the training corpus.
E95-1037.txt,61,The words with tags NC_comma_ NNU and NNUS and Ditto tags are not considered.
E95-1037.txt,62,Here NC means cited words_comma_ and NNU NNUS denotes abbreviated plural unit of measurement unmarked for number.
E95-1037.txt,63,Ditto tags are those words whose senses in combination differ from the role of the same words in other context.
E95-1037.txt,64,For example_comma_ as to _comma_ each other _comma_ and so as to Johansson_comma_ 1986 .
E95-1037.txt,65,268 Table 1.

E95-1037.txt,67,For example_comma_ 439 verbs in LOB Corpus have relationships with the word problem in different degrees.
E95-1037.txt,68,Some of them are listed below in descending order by the strength.
E95-1037.txt,69,solve 225.21 _comma_ face 84.64 ..... specify 16.55 ..... explain 6.47 _comma_ ..._comma_ fal1 2.52 ..... suppose 1.67 .... For the example in Section 1_comma_ the word problem and dislocation are coherent with the verbs and nouns in the discourse.
E95-1037.txt,70,The nouns with the strongest connectivity form the preferred topic set.
E95-1037.txt,71,Consider the interference effects.
E95-1037.txt,72,The constituents far apart have less relationship.
E95-1037.txt,73,Distance D X_comma_Y is used to measure such effects.
E95-1037.txt,74,Assume there are m nouns and n verbs in a paragraph.
E95-1037.txt,75,The connective strength of a noun Ni 1 i m is defined to be CSNN N  Z ANN N_comma_ N k D Ni_comma_ Ark  7 k CSNV N  Z ANN N _comma_ V k D N_comma__comma_ V k 8 k CS N  PN. CSNN N_comma_ PV.
E95-1037.txt,76,CSNV N  c 9 where CS denotes the connective strength_comma_ and PAr and PV are parameters for CSNN and CSNV and PN PV I.
E95-1037.txt,77,The determination of par and PV is via deleted interpolation Jelinek_comma_ 1985 .
E95-1037.txt,78,Using equation PN PV 1 and equation 9_comma_ we could derive PAr and PV as equation 10 and equation 11 show.
E95-1037.txt,79,CS CSNV PN 10 CSNN CSNV CS CSNN PV 11 CSNV CSNN LOB corpus are separated into two parts whose volume ratio is 3 1.
E95-1037.txt,80,Both PN and PV are initialized to 0.5 and then are trained by using the 3 4 corpus.
E95-1037.txt,81,Alter the first set of parameters is generated_comma_ the remain 1 4 LOB corpus is run until par and PV converge using equations 9_comma_ 10 and 11.
E95-1037.txt,82,Finally_comma_ the parameters_comma_ PN and PV_comma_ converge to 0.675844 and 0.324156 respectively.
E95-1037.txt,83,3 Topic Identification in a Paragraph The test data are selected from the first text of the files LOBT DI_comma_ LOBT F1_comma_ LOBT G1_comma_ LOBT H1_comma_ LOBT KI_comma_ LOBT M1 and LOBT N1 of horizontal version of LOB Tagged Corpus for inside test hereafter_comma_ we will use D01_comma_ F01_comma_ G01_comma_ H01_comma_ K01_comma_ M01_comma_ and N01 to represent these texts respectively .
E95-1037.txt,84,Category D denotes religion_comma_ Category F denotes popular lore_comma_ Category G denotes belles lettres_comma_ biography and essays_comma_ Category H denotes Miscellaneous texts_comma_ Category K denotes general fiction_comma_ Category M denotes science fiction_comma_ and Category N denotes adventure and western fiction.
E95-1037.txt,85,Each paragraph has predetermined topics called assumed topics which are determined by a linguist.
E95-1037.txt,86,Because a noun with basic form N may appear more than once in the paragraph_comma_ say k times_comma_ its strength is normalized by the following recursive formula NCS N m  CS N o  12 NCS No o NCS No _comma___comma_  1 NCS No _comma___comma_ .CS No o 13 where NCS represents the net connective strength_comma_ o k denotes the cardinal number of the k th occurrence of the same N such that C NoO  C No 2  C No 3 ... C No k l  C No k .
E95-1037.txt,87,The possible topic N has the high probability NCS N .
E95-1037.txt,88,Here_comma_ a topic set whose members are the first 20 of the candidates is formed.
E95-1037.txt,89,The performance can be measured as the Table 2 shows.
E95-1037.txt,90,4 The Preliminary Experimental Results According to the language model mentioned in Section 2_comma_ we build the ANN and ANV values for each noun noun pair and noun verb pair.
E95-1037.txt,91,Then_comma_ we apply recursive formula of NCS shown in equations 12 and 13 to identifying the topic set for test texts.
E95-1037.txt,92,Table 3 shows experimental results.
E95-1037.txt,93,Symbols tx and c denotes mean and standard deviation.  denotes correct number_comma_  denotes error number and  denotes undecidable number in topic identification.
E95-1037.txt,94,The undecidable case is that the assumed topic is a pronoun.
E95-1037.txt,95,Figure 1 shows correct rate_comma_ error rate_comma_ and undecidable rate.
E95-1037.txt,96,Row 1 in Table 3 shows the difficulty in finding topics from many candidates.
E95-1037.txt,97,In general_comma_ there are more than 20 candidates in a paragraph_comma_ It is impossible to select topics at random.
E95-1037.txt,98,Row 2 gives 269 the rank of assumed topic.
E95-1037.txt,99,The assumed topics are assigned by a linguist.
E95-1037.txt,100,Comparing row 1 and row 2 _comma_ the average number of candidates are much larger than the rank of assumed topic.
E95-1037.txt,101,Since it is impossible to randomly select candidates as topics_comma_ we know topic identification is valuable.
E95-1037.txt,102,Rows 3 _comma_ 4 and 5 list the frequencies of candidates_comma_ assumed topics and computed topic.
E95-1037.txt,103,The results intensify the viewpoint that the repeated words make persons impressive_comma_ and these words are likely to be topics.
E95-1037.txt,104,Our topic identification algorithm demonstrates the similar behavior see rows 4 and 5 .
E95-1037.txt,105,The average frequencies of assumed topics and computed topics are close and both of them are larger than average frequency of candidates.
E95-1037.txt,106,Figure 2 clearly demonstrates this point.
E95-1037.txt,107,Row 6 reflects an interesting phenomenon.
E95-1037.txt,108,The topic shifted by authors from paragraph to paragraph is demonstrated through comparison of data shown in this row and row 2 .
E95-1037.txt,109,The rank value of previous topics do obviously increase.

E95-1037.txt,116,This paper proposes a corpus based language model to tackle topi.c identification.
E95-1037.txt,117,The word association norms of nounnoun pairs and noun verb pairs which model the meanings of texts are based on three factors 1 word importance_comma_ 2 pair occurrence_comma_ and 3 distance.
E95-1037.txt,118,The nouns that have the stronger connectivities with other nouns and verbs in a discourse could form a preferred topic set.
E95-1037.txt,119,Inside test of this proposed algorithm shows 61.07 correct rate 80 of 131 paragraphs .
E95-1037.txt,120,Besides topic identification_comma_ the algorithm could detect topic shift phenomenon.
E95-1037.txt,121,The meaning transition from paragraph to paragraph could be detected by the following way.
E95-1037.txt,122,The connective strengths of the topics in the previous paragraph with the nouns and the verbs in the current paragraph are computed_comma_ and compared with the topics in the current paragraph.
E95-1037.txt,123,As our experiments show_comma_ the previous topics have the tendency to decrease their strengths in the current paragraph.
E95-1037.txt,124,Acknowledgment We are thankful to Yu Fang Wang and Yue Shi Lee for their help in this work. .
E95-1012.txt,1,this paper we provide a probabilistic interpretation for typed feature structures very similar to those used by Pollard and Sag. We begin with a version of the interpretation which lacks a treatment of re entrant feature structures_comma_ then provide an extended interpretation which allows them.
E95-1012.txt,2,We sketch algorithms allowing the numerical parameters of our probabilistic interpretations of HPSG to be estimated from corpora.
E95-1012.txt,4,The purpose of our paper is to develop a principled technique for attaching a probabilistic interpretation to feature structures.
E95-1012.txt,5,Our techniques apply to the feature structures described by Carpenter Carpenter_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1012.txt,6,Since these structures are the ones which are used in by Pollard and Sag Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 their relevance to computational grammars is apparent.
E95-1012.txt,7,On the basis of the usefulness of probabilistic context free grammars Charniak_comma_ 1993_comma_ ch. 5 _comma_ it is plausible to assume that that the extension of probabilistic techniques to such structures will allow the application of known and new techniques of parse ranking and grammar induction to more interesting grammars than has hitherto been the case.
E95-1012.txt,8,The paper is structured as follows.
E95-1012.txt,9,We start by reviewing the training and use of probabilistic context free grammars PCFGs .
E95-1012.txt,10,We then de velop a technique to allow analogous probabilistic annotations on type hierarchies.
E95-1012.txt,11,This gives us a clear account of the relationship between a large class of feature structures and their probabilities_comma_ but does not treat re entrancy.
E95-1012.txt,12,We conclude by sketching a technique which does treat such structures.
E95-1012.txt,13,While we know of previous work which associates scores with feature structures Kim_comma_ 1994 are not aware of any previous treatment which makes explicit the link to classical probability theory.
E95-1012.txt,14,We take a slightly unconventional perspective on feature structures_comma_ because it is easier to cast our theory within the more general framework of incremental description refinement Mellish_comma_ 1988 than to exploit the usual metaphors of constraint based grammar.
E95-1012.txt,15,In fact we can afford to remain entirely agnostic about the means by which the HPSG grammar associates signs with linguistic strings_comma_ because all that we need in order to train our stochastic procedures is a corpus of signs which are known to be valid descriptions of strings.
E95-1012.txt,16,2 Probabilistic interpretation of PCFGs We review the standard probabilistic interpretation of PCFGs 1 A PCFG is a four tuple W_comma_N_comma_ N1_comma_R _comma_ where W is a Set of terminal symbols wl_comma_..._comma_ w _comma_ N is a set of non terminal symbols N1_comma_..._comma_N _comma_ N1 is the starting symbol and R is a set of rules of the form N  J_comma_ where J is a string of terminals and non terminals. Each rule has a probability P N i  J and the probabilities for all the rules that expand a given nonterminal must sum to one.
E95-1012.txt,17,We associate probabilities with partial phrase markers_comma_ which are sets of terminal and non terminal nodes generated by beginning from the starting node successively expanding non terminal leaves of the partial tree.
E95-1012.txt,18,Phrase markers are those partial phrase markers which have no non terminal leaves.
E95-1012.txt,19,Probabilities are assigned by the following inductive definition P N1 1. If T is a partial phrase marker_comma_ and T is a partial phrase marker which differs from it only in that a single non terminal node N k in T has been expanded to  in T _comma_ then P T  P T P N  .
E95-1012.txt,20,In this definition R acts as a specification of the accessibility relationships which can hold between nodes of the trees admitted by the grammar.
E95-1012.txt,21,The rule probabilities specify the cost of 1 Our description is closely based on that given by Charniak Charniak_comma_ 1993_comma_ p. 52 if 83 making particular choices about the way in which the rules develop.
E95-1012.txt,22,It is going to turn out that an exactly analogous system of accessibility relations is present in the probabilistic type hierarchies which we define later.
E95-1012.txt,23,Limitations of PCFGs The definition of PCFGs implies that the probability of a phrase marker depends only on the choice of rules used in expanding non terminal nodes.
E95-1012.txt,24,In particular_comma_ the probability does not depend on the order in which the rules are applied.
E95-1012.txt,25,This has the arguably unwelcome consequence that PCFGs are unable to make certain discriminations between trees which differ only in their configuration 2.
E95-1012.txt,26,The models developed in this paper build in similar independence assumptions.
E95-1012.txt,27,A large part of the art of probabilistic language modelling resides in the management of the trade off between descriptive power which has the merit of allowing us to make the discriminations which we want and independence assumptions which have the merit of making training practical by allowing us to treat similar situations as equivalent .
E95-1012.txt,28,The crucial advantage of PCFGs over CFGs is that they can be trained and or learned from corpora.
E95-1012.txt,29,Readers for whom this fact is unfamiliar are referred to Charniak s textbook Charniak_comma_ 1993_comma_ Chapter 7 .
E95-1012.txt,30,We do not have space to recapitulate the discussion of training which can be found there.
E95-1012.txt,31,We do however illustrate the outcome of training.
E95-1012.txt,32,2.1 Applying a PCFG to a simple corpus Consider the simple grammar in figure 1 and its training against the corpus in figure 2.
E95-1012.txt,34,Figure 4 An ALE signature 85 NT1 is the starting symbol and I is a set of .
E95-1007.txt,1,this paper_comma_ we prove the decidability of the generation problem for those unification grammars which are based on contextfree phrase structure rule skeletons_comma_ like e.g. LFG and PATR II.
E95-1007.txt,2,The result shows a perhaps unexpected asymmetry_comma_ since it is valid also for those unification grammars whose parsing problem is undecidable_comma_ e.g. grammars which do not satisfy the off line parsability constraint.
E95-1007.txt,3,The general proof is achieved by showing that the space of the derivations which have to be considered in order to decide the problem for a given input is always restricted to derivations whose length is limited by some fixed upper bound which is determined relative to the size of the input.
E95-1007.txt,5,Unification Grammars with a context free skeleton_comma_ like Lexical Fhnctional Grammar LFG and PATRII cf. e.g. Kaplan and Bresnan 1982_comma_ Shieber et al. 1983 assign to a sentence not only a constituent structure c structure _comma_ but also an additional linguistic entity.
E95-1007.txt,6,In the rather restricted grammars of the early stage this entity is identified with a special graph structure_comma_ commonly called feature structure.
E95-1007.txt,7,Since a string is regarded as well formed only if a well formed feature structure is assigned to it by the grammar_comma_ two inverse decidability problems arise which had to be solved in order to know whether we can formulate terminating parsing and generation algorithms.
E95-1007.txt,8,If we retain the terminology of the early stages then an adequate parsing algorithm requires that we can decide for a given grammar and a given string whether there exists a feature structure assigned to it by the grammar parsing problem and an adequate generation algorithm requires that we can decide for a given grammar and a given feature structure whether there exists a sentence to which this structure is assigned by the grammar generation problem .
E95-1007.txt,9,While we already know for a long time that the parsing problem is undecidable cf. Kaplan and Bresnan 1982_comma_ Johnson 1988 _comma_ we want to show in this paper that the generation problem is decidable even for unrestricted not off line parsable unification grammars.
E95-1007.txt,10,For the proof we first introduce in section 2 the type of grammar we want to consider.
E95-1007.txt,11,In section 3 we then define the generation problem and show its decidability in two steps.
E95-1007.txt,12,2 Preliminaries The unification grammars we want to consider consist of rules with a context free skeleton and a set of annotations associated with the constituents mentioned in the rules.
E95-1007.txt,13,Typical examples taken from LFG and PATR II are given in figure 1.
E95-1007.txt,14,For the forS  NP VP S  NP VP t SUB J  j  VP AGR  NP AGR NP John NP 4 Uther 1 PRED JOHN NP AGR NUM SG NP AGR PER  3RD Figure 1 Examples of rules in LFG left and PATR II format right . mal definition of those grammars we reconstruct the annotations as formulas of a quantifier free sublanguage of a classical first order language with equality whose nonlogical symbols are given by a finite set of unary partial function symbols and a finite set of constants.
E95-1007.txt,15,For the translation of LFG and PATR II annotations we regard the attributes in figure 1 SUB J_comma_ PRED_comma_ AGR_comma_ NUM_comma_ PER 58 unary partial function symbols and the atomic values in figure 1 JOHN_comma_ 45 SG_comma_ 3RD as individual constants.
E95-1007.txt,16,Furthermore_comma_ we assume for a context free rule of the form A  w w e VN U VT that the variable x0 is associated with A and that for each occurrence wi in w there is a variable xi which is associated with wi.
E95-1007.txt,17,For the formal reconstruction of LFG s we assume that each occurrence of in the annotation of w corresponds to an occurrence of xi and that each occurrence of 1 corresponds to an occurrence of x0.
E95-1007.txt,18,For grammars in PATR II format we suppose that occurrences of categories in the annotations correspond to the associated variables.
E95-1007.txt,19,Before we give the definition of the grammars we want to investigate_comma_ we introduce the following notation.
E95-1007.txt,24,2 According to our definition the LFG rules in figure 1 are now expressed as depicted in la and the PATRII rules as given in lb .
E95-1007.txt,25,Note that the structure of the terms is now mirror imaged _comma_ since we assume the attributes to be unary partial function symbols.
E95-1007.txt,27,In the definition we assume that the order of the arcs of a tree is encoded by numbering the arcs and that each node is identified with the sequence of integers numbering the arcs along the path from the 1The syntax and semantics of feature description languages is given in the appendix.
E95-1007.txt,28,2A literal is an atomic formula or the negation of an atomic formula. root O to that node.
E95-1007.txt,29,In our bracket notation we add to a constituent its root node as the right and its root node label as the left index.
E95-1007.txt,30,In order to be able to refer to the c structure derivation and to the sequence of feature descriptions and to have access to the nodes which are substituted in each step of a derivation_comma_ we define for a derivation 7r three other sequences.
E95-1007.txt,33,Let r be a derivation of length n.
E95-1007.txt,35,Let S be a set of literals and 0 a unary partial mapping over the set of terms.
E95-1007.txt,37,The feature description derived by zr is then defined by means of the following operation.
E95-1007.txt,41,i h EXAMPLE 1.
E95-1007.txt,43,3 In the following we write S for S _ n if the interval covers the whole derivation_comma_ i.e. if r is of length n.
E95-1007.txt,44,Since a specific reduction algorithm and a few model theoretic facts required in the proofs later on can be introduced by showing how satisfiability of such existential prenex formulas can be decided_comma_ we will continue with a short excursion on satisfiability.
E95-1007.txt,46,46 2.1 Satisfiability In order to test whether for a given finite set of literals S of a feature description language 2 2 3z ..zt A S x _comma_.._comma_ zl is satisfiable_comma_ we can exploit by skolemization wellknown test procedures available for quantifier and variable free sets of such literals.
E95-1007.txt,49,Let 7 be the set of terms of a variable free feature description language L C .
E95-1007.txt,52,VT T So 7 SVB fEp  PMp S O.
E95-1007.txt,54,If the condition is satisfied M_comma_ holds for every  So. If  T S o with m T  m r _comma_ then v T o by 7 ii and hence hC T  T .
E95-1007.txt,55,We get then h   T for m T  m T by T T and for m  m  by the definition of h _comma_ since r f T .
E95-1007.txt,56,Thus p T  p T by 9 i and hence Mo .
E95-1007.txt,57,Assume TCT .
E95-1007.txt,58,If T 7 were satisfied by Mp_comma_ we would get p T p T and by 9 ii T_comma_T SUB TE_comma_ .
E95-1007.txt,60,3 The Generation Problem and its Decidability Although it was not necessary for the definition of the sentences derivable by a unification grammar_comma_ we now have to make explicit that also a feature description is assigned to a sentence.
E95-1007.txt,67,Definition 12 now brings us closer to the problem_comma_ since we can for any unification grammar in rather .
E95-1035.txt,1,describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse which takes into account the effects of tense_comma_ aspect_comma_ temporal adverbials and rhetorical structure and which minimises unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure It is part of a discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter s ALE formalism. The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures_comma_ exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal rhetorical structure until higher level information can be used to disambiguate. the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse_comma_ taking into account the effect of tense_comma_ aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure.
E95-1035.txt,2,The method combines a constraint based approach with an approach based on preferences we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense_comma_ aspect_comma_ rhetorical structure and temporal expressions_comma_ and we use the temporal centering preferences described by Kameyama et al._comma_ 1993 Poesio_comma_ 1994 to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them.
E95-1035.txt,3,The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi s discourse grammar Scha Polanyi 1988 Priist et al 1994 .
E95-1035.txt,4,For the implementation we extended the HPSG grammar Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in ALE Carpenter_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1035.txt,5,This paper will focus on our temporal processing algorithm_comma_ and in particular on our analysis of narrative progression_comma_ rhetorical structure_comma_ perfects and temporal expressions 1 .
E95-1035.txt,6,In this paper we describe a method for analysing the temporal structure of a discourse L This component was implemented as part of a discourse grammar for English.
E95-1035.txt,7,The goals of We would like to thank Alex Lascarides and Massimo Poesio for comments on an earlier draft.
E95-1035.txt,8,tThis work was supported in part by the European Commission s programme on Linguistic Research and Engineering through project LRE 61062_comma_ Towards a declarative theory of discourse. 2 Constraints on narrative continuations Probably the best known algorithm for tracking narrative progression is that developed by Kamp 1979 _comma_ Hinrichs 1981 _comma_ and Partee 1984 _comma_ which formalises the observation that an event will occur just after a preceding event_comma_ while a state will overlap with a preceding event.
E95-1035.txt,9,This algorithm gives the correct results in examples such as the following 253 1 John entered the room.
E95-1035.txt,10,Mary stood up.
E95-1035.txt,11,2 John entered the room.
E95-1035.txt,12,Mary was seated behind the desk.
E95-1035.txt,13,In 1 the event of Mary s standing is understood to occur just after John enters the room_comma_ while in 2 the state in which Mary is seated is understood to overlap with the event of John s entering the room.
E95-1035.txt,14,However_comma_ if there is a rhetorical relationship between two eventualities such as causation_comma_ elaboration or enablement_comma_ the temporal defaults can be overridden_comma_ as in the following examples 3 a.
E95-1035.txt,16,Mary pushed him. b.
E95-1035.txt,17,Local builders constructed the Ford St. Bridge.
E95-1035.txt,18,They used 3 tons of bricks.
E95-1035.txt,19,In 3a there is a causal relationship between Mary s pushing John and his falling_comma_ and the second event is understood to precede the first.
E95-1035.txt,20,In 3b _comma_ the second sentence is an elaboration of the first_comma_ and they therefore refer to aspects of the same event rather than to two sequential events.
E95-1035.txt,21,It has been suggested that only world knowledge allows one to detect that the default is being overridden here.
E95-1035.txt,22,For example_comma_ Lascarides Asher 1991 suggest that general knowledge postulates in the case of 3a that a pushing can cause a falling can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading.
E95-1035.txt,23,The problem for practical systems is twofold we could assume that in the case of narrative the Kamp Hinrichs Partee algorithm is the default_comma_ but each time the default is applied we would need to check all our available world knowledge to see whether there isn t a world knowledge postulate which might be overriding this assumption.
E95-1035.txt,24,Clearly this would make the processing of text a very expensive operation.
E95-1035.txt,25,An alternative is to assume that the temporal ordering between events in two consecutive sentences can be any of the four possibilities just_after_comma_ precede_comma_ same event and overlap .
E95-1035.txt,26,But then the resulting temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even in small discourses.
E95-1035.txt,27,And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted.
E95-1035.txt,28,Consider 4 Mary stared at John.
E95-1035.txt,29,He gave her back her slice of pizza.
E95-1035.txt,30,Here_comma_ it would appear_comma_ only one reading is possible_comma_ i.e. the one where John gave Mary her slice of pizza just after she stared or started to stare at him.
E95-1035.txt,31,It would be undesirable for the temporal processing mechanism to postulate an ambiguity in this case.
E95-1035.txt,32,Of course_comma_ sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation.
E95-1035.txt,33,For example_comma_ in 5 the order of the events is understood to be the reverse of that in 1 due to the cue word because which signals a causal relationship between the events 5 John entered the room because Mary stood up.
E95-1035.txt,34,As Kehler 1994 points out_comma_ if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences_comma_ then the use of because in 5 should cause a temporal clash whereas it is perfectly felicitous.
E95-1035.txt,35,Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense.
E95-1035.txt,36,In 6 _comma_ for example_comma_ the default interpretation would be that John s being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston_comma_ but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this_comma_ giving the interpretation that John s being in Detroit precedes his being in Boston 6 John was in Boston.
E95-1035.txt,37,The previous Thursday he was in Detroit.
E95-1035.txt,38,This suggests that the temporal information given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on temporal structure than the information given by temporal adverbials.
E95-1035.txt,39,The possibilities for rhetorical relations e.g._comma_ whether something is narration_comma_ or elaboration_comma_ or a causal relation can be further constrained by aspect.
E95-1035.txt,40,For example_comma_ a state can elaborate another state or an event 7 a.

E95-1035.txt,83,For the eventive second sentence of 8b to be an elaboration of the first sentence_comma_ it must occur in a stative form for example as a progressive i.e._comma_ She was building a dog house .
E95-1035.txt,84,Because of considerations like these_comma_ our aim in the implementation work was to treat tense_comma_ aspect_comma_ cue words and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining_comma_ with more specific information such as explicit cue words having higher priority than less specific information such as tense.
E95-1035.txt,85,The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates.
E95-1035.txt,86,Table 1 lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words_comma_ where the first sentence S1 may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence S expresses a simple past event.
E95-1035.txt,87,We constrain 2 in this way because of lack of space additional constraints are given in Hitzeman et al._comma_ 1994 .
E95-1035.txt,88,For example_comma_ if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first_comma_ to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first an elaboration relation _comma_ but the two events cannot overlap these constraints 255 are weaker_comma_ however_comma_ than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions.
E95-1035.txt,89,When 1 expresses a state_comma_ it is possible for the temporal relation to hold between the event described by 2 and the event or activity most closely preceding 1_comma_ i.e._comma_ the temporal focus of 1_comma_ here referred to as TF1.1 However_comma_ we haven t solved the problem completely at this point although tense can provide a further constraint on the temporal structure of such discourses_comma_ it can also add a further ambiguity.
E95-1035.txt,90,Consider 9 9 Sam rang the bell.
E95-1035.txt,91,He had lost the key.
E95-1035.txt,92,Clearly_comma_ the event described by the past perfect sentence must precede the event described by the first_comma_ simple past sentence.
E95-1035.txt,93,However_comma_ if a third sentence is added_comma_ an ambiguity results.
E95-1035.txt,94,Consider the following possible continuations of 9 10 a .... Hannah opened the door. b .... It fell through a hole in his pocket.
E95-1035.txt,95,The temporal relation between these continuations and the portion of earlier text they attach to is constrained along the lines sketched before.
E95-1035.txt,96,The problem here is determining which thread in 9 they continue 10a continues the thread in which Sam rings the bell_comma_ but 10b continues the thread in which Sam loses the key.
E95-1035.txt,97,A further ambiguity is that when the third sentence is past perfect_comma_ it may be a continuation of a preceding thread or the start of a new thread itself.

E95-1035.txt,106,However_comma_ it is important not to ignore tense because other combinations of tense and aspect do show that tense affects which relations are possible_comma_ e.g._comma_ a simple past stative 2 cannot have a precede relation with any 1_comma_ while a past perfect stative 2 can. new thread.
E95-1035.txt,107,2 For the problem with multi sentence discourses_comma_ and the threads that sentences continue_comma_ we use an implementation of temporM centering Kameyama et al._comma_ 1993 Poesio_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1035.txt,108,This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora Sidner_comma_ 1983 Grosz et al._comma_ 1983 .
E95-1035.txt,109,Centering assumes that discourse understanding requires some notion of aboutness. While nominal centering assumes there is one object that the current discourse is about_comma_ temporal centering assumes that there is one thread that the discourse is currently following_comma_ and that_comma_ in addition to tense and aspect constraints_comma_ there is a preference for a new utterance to continue a thread which has a parallel tense or which is semantically related to it and a preference to continue the current thread rather than switching to another thread.

E95-1006.txt,1,paper defines a language Z for specifying LFG grammars. This enables constraints on LFG s composite ontology c structures synchronised with fstructures to be stated directly no appeal to the LFG construction algorithm is needed.
E95-1006.txt,2,We use f to specify schemata annotated rules and the LFG uniqueness_comma_ completeness and coherence principles.
E95-1006.txt,3,Broader issues raised by this work are noted and discussed.
E95-1006.txt,5,Unlike most linguistic theories_comma_ LFG see Kaplan and Bresnan 1982 treats grammatical relations as first class citizens.
E95-1006.txt,6,Accordingly_comma_ it casts its linguistic analyses in terms of a composite ontology two independent domains a domain of constituency information c structure _comma_ and a domain of grammatical function information f structure linked together in a mutually constraining manner.
E95-1006.txt,7,As has been amply demonstrated over the last fifteen years_comma_ this view permits perspicuous analyses of a wide variety of linguistic data.
E95-1006.txt,8,However standard formalisations of LFG do not capture its strikingly simple underlying intuitions.
E95-1006.txt,9,Instead_comma_ they make a detour via the LFG construction algorithm_comma_ which explains how equational constraints linking subtrees and feature str.uctures are to be resolved.
E95-1006.txt,10,The main point of the present paper is to show that such detours are unnecessary.
E95-1006.txt,11,We define a specification language in which most of the interactions between cand f structure typical of LFG grammars can be stated directly.
E95-1006.txt,12,The key idea underlying our approach is to think about LFG model theoretically.
E95-1006.txt,13,That is_comma_ our first task will be to give a precise and transparent mathematical picture of the LFG ontology.
E95-1006.txt,14,As has already been noted_comma_ the basic entities underlying the LFG analyses are composite structures consisting of a finite tree_comma_ a finite feature structure_comma_ and a function that links the two.
E95-1006.txt,15,Such structures can straightforwardly be thought of as models_comma_ in the usual sense of first order model theory see Hodges 1993 .
E95-1006.txt,16,Viewing the LFG ontology in such terms does no violence to intuition indeed_comma_ as we shall see_comma_ a more direct mathematical embodiment of the LFG universe can hardly be imagined.
E95-1006.txt,17,Once the ontological issues have been settled we turn to our ultimate goal providing a specification language for LFG grammars.
E95-1006.txt,18,Actually_comma_ with the ontological issues settled it is a relatively simple task to devise suitable specification languages we simply consider how LFG linguists talk about such structures when they write grammars.
E95-1006.txt,19,That is_comma_ we ask ourselves what kind of constraints the linguist wishes to impose_comma_ and then devise a language in which they can be stated.
E95-1006.txt,20,Thus we shall proceed as follows.
E95-1006.txt,21,After a brief .
E95-1042.txt,1,this paper we show how to use the socalled aggregation technique to remove redundancies in the fact base of the Visual and Natural language Specification Tool VINST . The current aggregation modules of the natural language generator of VINST is described and an improvement is proposed with one new aggregation rule and a bidirectional grammar.
E95-1042.txt,3,This paper describes the aggregation process in the natural language generator of the Visual and Natural language Specification Tool VINST _comma_ and how the aggregation can be improved.
E95-1042.txt,4,Aggregation is the process which removes redundancy in texts.
E95-1042.txt,5,Redundancy typically occurs when the material selected for communication contains information that is duplicated in the text_comma_ or else is so closely related that the reader can automatically infer one piece when reading another.
E95-1042.txt,6,Aggregation is also called ellipsis by linguists.
E95-1042.txt,7,In the VINST system Natural Language generation is applied in various places.
E95-1042.txt,8,In the specification part to paraphrase the rules expressed in formal language_comma_ to paraphrase automata_comma_ further on to paraphrase questions asked to the theorem prover_comma_ and to paraphrase the executed events and the newly created fact base.
E95-1042.txt,9,We will in this paper only treat the generation of NL from fact bases.
E95-1042.txt,10,The kind of text produced in this domain is illustrated in the right hand window of VINST in figure 1.
E95-1042.txt,11,When generating a text from a fact base in VINST the text becomes very tedious to read since the text is very redundant and does not feel correct conceptually.
E95-1042.txt,12,To make the text smoother to read a new architecture is suggested where a new aggregation rule from Dalianis Hovy 1993 is suggested to be used_comma_ namely predicate grouping rule. 6 File Edit UINST 1mulatorlt Figure 1.
E95-1042.txt,13,The event window_comma_ where the user can execute events and the inter preter intewrets the specification.
E95-1042.txt,14,The VINST system is a multi modal specification and validation tool_comma_ specifically for the functionality of telecom services.
E95-1042.txt,15,The specification is carried out with a Visual Language VL and a restricted Natural Language NL _comma_ which are translated to LOXY Echarti St lmarck 1988 _comma_ a First Order Language extended with time.
E95-1042.txt,16,The VINST system is a ready usable prototype which has been demonstrated and tested on various sites in the world Engstedt 1991_comma_ Preifelt Engstedt 1992 .
E95-1042.txt,17,The VINST prototype is implemented in AAIS Prolog and SuperCard on Macintosh.
E95-1042.txt,18,The Prolog is used for the NL system and the SuperCard for the VL part and for the user interaction of the system.
E95-1042.txt,20,Previous research Several studies on aggregating text based on text structure appear in the literature.
E95-1042.txt,21,In fact_comma_ the term aggregation was first used in Mann Moore 1980 .
E95-1042.txt,22,In Horacek 1992 _comma_ is described the integration of aggregation which he calls grouping with quantification under guidance of principles of conversational implicature.
E95-1042.txt,23,Dale 1990 calls it discourse level optimization_comma_ Kempen 1991 calls it forward and backward conjunction reduction.
E95-1042.txt,24,In Hovy 1990 two structural aggregation rules are used to eliminate redundant information.
E95-1042.txt,25,In an example in Scott de Souza 1990 _comma_ nine heuristic rules aggregate six sentences which express a set of facts using a single sentence.
E95-1042.txt,26,In Dalianis Hovy 1993 are eight different aggregation rules described.
E95-1042.txt,28,The current NL generator To solve the problem of the not naturalness of the LOXY formulas and make them more natural the following two modules have been constructed the natural and compact modules and finally the surface grammar.
E95-1042.txt,29,The LOXY formula which is to be paraphrased is processed step by step to natural language by the different modules to a deep structure.
E95-1042.txt,30,The natural_comma_ and compact modules can be activated and deactivated separately.
E95-1042.txt,31,Finally the surface generator generates natural language text from the deep structure.
E95-1042.txt,32,The surface grammar contains its own generation grammar and uses the same dictionary as the NLparser.
E95-1042.txt,33,The surface generation grammar is a Definite Clause Grammar_comma_ DCG_comma_ Pereira Warren 1980_comma_ Clocksin Mellish 1984 _comma_ and is not treated in this paper.
E95-1042.txt,35,Natural module The natural module creates a deep structure from the flat LOXY formula_comma_ by looking up its elements in the dictionary.
E95-1042.txt,36,From this information it can decide what the deep structure should look like.
E95-1042.txt,37,The natural module is also called sentence planner_comma_ i.e. it plans the length and the internal order of the different sentences. tl is a subscriber and tl is idle and tl has 100 and 100 is a phonenumber and tl has 101 and 101 is a phonenumber and t2 is a subscriber and t2 is idle and t2 has 200 and 200 is a phonenumber.
E95-1042.txt,38,Figure 2a Normal mode_comma_ only surface generation.
E95-1042.txt,39,The natural module does what Dalianis Hovy 1993 calls ordering and economy. an idle subscriber tl has a phonenumber 100 and an idle subscriber tl has a phonenumber 101 and an idle subscriber t2 has a phonenumber 200.
E95-1042.txt,40,Figure 2b Natural mode 5.
E95-1042.txt,41,Compact module The natural language expression_comma_ after being processed by the natural module has a lot of redundant noun phrases.
E95-1042.txt,42,This is solved by the compact module.
E95-1042.txt,43,Our aggregation rule says If two or more identical and hence redundant noun phrases are repeated consecutive then remove all the noun phrases except the first one This operation will remove the repetitive generation of the noun phrase and the text becomes concise.
E95-1042.txt,44,Dalianis Hovy 1993 calls this subject grouping. an idle subscriber tl has a phonenumber 100 and has a phonenumber 101 and an idle subscriber t2 has a phonenumber 200.
E95-1042.txt,45,Figure 2c Natural mode compact mode What we see is that the text can be aggregated in a different way and also that the subject grouping has not been fully applied on the phonenumbers.
E95-1042.txt,47,Paraphrase fact bases Fact bases can be paraphrased into natural language either after that an event is executed with the interpreter or as an answer to a question to the theorem prover.
E95-1042.txt,48,Here we show an example of the latter_comma_ see Figure 3 .
E95-1042.txt,49,A question expressed in NL It is difficult to express questions in VL is translated to a LOXY expression that the theorem prover tries to prove.
E95-1042.txt,50,The generation module takes the proved query and generates an NL answer. ...... ._FIle Edit UINEI Qumry ......... Que I I Rnstuer i asttbsatber tl hen L_comma_ pho rlurrlber 101 J a hc nunlber 200 alld hu s phoe_comma_ er mbef lol arid a phorNm 100 and an kJe sut cdb t2 has I ap 2OOar Figure 3.
E95-1042.txt,51,The query window_comma_ where the user can ask questions and obtain answers via the theorem prover.
E95-1042.txt,53,Improvements on architecture The present natural language generator of VINST is difficult to control because there are only two control features natural and compact available.
E95-1042.txt,54,It is required great effort to adapt the NL generator to new domains or to extend it without writing new grammar rules.
E95-1042.txt,55,Further on it is difficult to express the NL paraphrase in a similar fashion as the user expresses him herself_comma_ therefore are some improvements suggested.
E95-1042.txt,56,One suggestion is is to use as a natural language grammar the Core Language Engine CLE Alshawi 1992 .
E95-1042.txt,57,CLE is a bidirectional_comma_ unification and feature based grammar written in Prolog.
E95-1042.txt,58,CLE uses Quasi Logical Form QLF as linguistic representation for the parsed NL string.
E95-1042.txt,59,QLF can be used to direct the generator_comma_ but it needs to be augmented.
E95-1042.txt,60,We have to construct an Intermediate Generation Form IGF which will contain the suitable linguistic primitives.
E95-1042.txt,61,The IGF will be acquired both from the user and from the context where the NL is to be paraphrased_comma_ e.g. simulation or query window.
E95-1042.txt,62,The used words of the user will be reused for generation together with the LOXY formula.
E95-1042.txt,63,When the paraphrasing will be carried out from a VL expression_comma_ then we have to use preset linguistic primitives and words for the NL generation because there will not be any linguistic primitives.
E95-1042.txt,65,Intermediate Generation Form The Intermediate Generation Form IGF will contain the type of sentences_comma_ e.g. a fact or an assertion dcl _comma_ a rule rule _comma_ a yes no question ynq _comma_ a what_comma_ which or who question whq _comma_ a noun phrase np and many more.
E95-1042.txt,66,The Quasi Logical Form QLF of CLE uses already dcl_comma_ ynq and whq and could be extended to also treat np.
E95-1042.txt,67,The rest of the type of sentences are context dependent_comma_ i.e. rule etc. The sentence types above are identical with the ones in the QLF_comma_ except of the sentence type np and some others which are VINST specific.
E95-1042.txt,68,To each type of sentence_comma_ above_comma_ there is a set of features_comma_ e.g. adjective form adj _comma_ subjective predicative complement predcomp _comma_ subject grouping sg and predicate grouping pg and many more.
E95-1042.txt,69,The features can be unordered and the number can be arbitrary.
E95-1042.txt,70,Some of the features are the same as the one QLF uses_comma_ except for predcomp_comma_ sg and pg.
E95-1042.txt,71,The IGF contains also two aggregation features subject and predicate grouping which makes the text nicer to read.
E95-1042.txt,72,Observe that there is no time feature in the IGF_comma_ since LOXY has an embedded time.
E95-1042.txt,73,What we also need is a list of words used by the user.
E95-1042.txt,74,The words are obtained from the parser.
E95-1042.txt,75,The IGF needs to be stored together with the LOXY expression until they are going to be used by the NL generator.
E95-1042.txt,76,The syntax of the IGF is described by showing the Prolog predicate int_genform 3 and its content.
E95-1042.txt,77,int_gen_form REFNR_comma_ TYPE FEATURELIST _comma_ USED_WORD_LIST .
E95-1042.txt,78,REFNR is a reference number to the LOXYexpression to be paraphrased.
E95-1042.txt,79,TYPE is type of sentence and FEATURE_LIST is a list of feature names describing the sentences.
E95-1042.txt,80,USED_WORD_LIST is a list of previous used words.
E95-1042.txt,82,Paraphrase fact bases aggregated Here follows two examples on how the paraphrasing would look like with the new architecture upon paraphrasing a LOXY fact base to NL_comma_ Not yet implemented The only thing which changes between the two examples is the content of the IGF.
E95-1042.txt,83,Before generation input propositions are ordered based on the characteristics of their subjects_comma_ as described in Dalianis Hovy 1993 .
E95-1042.txt,84,Idle tl t2 Figure 4.
E95-1042.txt,86,In the second NL example_comma_ figure 4c _comma_ we see how the predicate grouping works.
E95-1042.txt,88,Conclusions and future work We have in this paper shortly described the current NL generator of the VINST system.
E95-1042.txt,89,We have found it too inflexible and the generated text too tedious to read_comma_ therefore is suggested a new NL architecture where the user and the context of the user interaction is used to extract an Intermediate Generation Form IGF .
E95-1042.txt,90,The IGF will contain a new aggregation rule_comma_ the so called predicate grouping rule which will make the generated text easier to read_comma_ further on is proposed to use a bidirectional grammar for the surface generation.
E95-1042.txt,91,One future suggestion is also to use the results from the NL parsing for the generation.

E95-1025.txt,1,is an extension of Standard Prolog with Features_comma_ Inheritance and Templates. ProFIT Mlows the programmer or grammar developer to declare an inheritance hierarchy_comma_ features and templates.
E95-1025.txt,2,Sorted feature terms can be used in ProFIT programs together with Prolog terms to provide a clearer description language for linguistic structures.
E95-1025.txt,3,ProFIT compiles all sorted feature terms into a Prolog term representation_comma_ so that the built in Prolog term unification can be used for the unification of sorted feature structures_comma_ and no special unification algorithm is needed.
E95-1025.txt,4,ProFIT programs are compiled into Prolog programs_comma_ so that no meta interpreter is needed for their execution.
E95-1025.txt,5,ProFIT thus provides a direct step from grammars developed with sorted feature terms to Prolog programs usable for practical NLP systems.
E95-1025.txt,7,There are two key ingredients for building an NLP system a linguistic description a processing model parser_comma_ generator etc. In the past decade_comma_ there have been diverging trends in the area of linguistic descriptions and in the area of processing models.
E95-1025.txt,8,Most large scale linguistic descriptions make use of sorted feature formalisms_comma_ 1 but implementations of these formalisms are in general too slow for building practically usable NLP systems.
E95-1025.txt,9,Most of the progress in constructing efficient parsers and generators has been based on logic grammars that make use 1Sorted feature structures are sometimes referred to as typed feature structures_comma_ e.g. in Carpenter s Logic of Typed Feature Structures. We follow the usage in Logic Programming and the recent HPSG literature. of ordinary prblog terms.
E95-1025.txt,10,We provide a general tool that brings together these developments by compiling sorted feature terms into a Prolog term representation_comma_ so that techniques from logic programming and logic grammars can be used to provide efficient processing models for sorted feature grammars.
E95-1025.txt,11,In this introductory section_comma_ we discuss the advantages of sorted feature formalisms_comma_ and of the logic grammar paradigm_comma_ and show how the two developments can be combined.
E95-1025.txt,12,The following sections describe the ProFIT language which provides sorted feature terms for Prolog_comma_ and its implementation.
E95-1025.txt,13,1.1 Grammar Development in Sorted Feature Formalisms Sorted feature formalisms are often used for the development of large coverage grammars_comma_ because they are very well suited for a structured description of complex linguistic data.
E95-1025.txt,14,Sorted feature terms have several advantages over Prolog terms as a representation langauge.
E95-1025.txt,16,They provide a compact notation.
E95-1025.txt,17,Features that are not instantiated can be omitted there is no need for anonymous variables.
E95-1025.txt,19,Features names are mnemonic_comma_ argument positions are not.
E95-1025.txt,21,Adding a new feature to a sort requires one change in a declaration_comma_ whereas adding an argument to a Prolog functor requires changes mostly insertion of anonymous variables to every occurence of the functor.
E95-1025.txt,23,Specification of the subsort relationship is more convenient than constructing Prolog terms which mirror these subsumption relationships.
E95-1025.txt,24,Implementations of sorted feature formalisms such as TDL Krieger and Sch ifer_comma_ 1994 _comma_ ALE Carpenter_comma_ 1993 _comma_ CUF DSrre and Dorna_comma_ 1993 _comma_ TFS Emele and Zajac_comma_ 1990 and others have been used successfully for the development and testing of large grammars and lexicons_comma_ but they may be too slow for actual use in applications 180 because they are generally built on top of Prolog or LISP_comma_ and can therefore not be as efficient as the built in unification of Prolog.
E95-1025.txt,25,There are a few logic programming langauges_comma_ such as LIFE Ait Kaci and Lincoln_comma_ 1989 or Oz Smolka et al._comma_ 1995 _comma_ that provide sorted feature terms_comma_ but no commercial implementations of these languages with efficient compilers are yet available.
E95-1025.txt,26,1.2 Efficient Processing based on Logic Grammars Much work on efficient processing algorithms has been done in the logic grammar framework.
E95-1025.txt,27,This includes work on Compiling grammars into efficient parsers and generators compilation of DCGs into top down Prolog programs_comma_ left corner parsers BUP _comma_ LR parsers_comma_ head corner parsers_comma_ and semantic head driven generators. Use of recta programming for self monitoring to ensure generation of unambiguous utterances Neumann and van Noord_comma_ 1992 Work in the area of Explanation Based Learning EBL to learn frequently used structures Samuelsson_comma_ 1994 Tabulation techniques_comma_ from the use of wellformed substring tables to the latest developments in Earley deduction_comma_ and memoing techniques for logic programming Neumann_comma_ 1994 Work based on Constraint Logic Programming CLP to provide processing models for principle based grammars Matiasek_comma_ 1994 Using coroutining dif_comma_ freeze etc. to provide more efficient processing models Partial deduction techniques to produce more efficient grammars Using Prolog and its indexing facilities to build up a lexicon database Since much of this work involves compilation of grammars into Prolog programs_comma_ such programs can immediately benefit from any improvements in Prolog compilers for example the tabulation provided by XSB Prolog can provide a more efficient implementation of charts which makes the grammars more usable for NLP systems.
E95-1025.txt,28,1.3 Combining Logic Grammars and Sorted Feature Formalisms It has been noted that first order Prolog terms provide the equivalent expressive power as sorted feature terms Mellish_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1025.txt,29,For example_comma_ Carpenter s typed feature structures Carpenter_comma_ 1992 can easily be represented as Prolog terms_comma_ if the restriction is given up that the sort hierarchy be a bounded complete partial order.
E95-1025.txt,30,Such compilation of sorted feature terms into Prolog terms has been successfully used in the Core Language Engine CLE Alshawi_comma_ 1991 and in the Advanced Linguistic Engineering Platform ALEP _comma_ Alshawi et al._comma_ 1991 .
E95-1025.txt,31,2 ProFIT extends the compilation techniques of these systems through the handling of multi dimensional inheritance Erbach_comma_ 1994 _comma_ and makes them generally available for a wide range of applications by translating programs or grammars with sorted feature terms into Prolog programs.
E95-1025.txt,32,ProFIT is not a grammar formalism_comma_ but rather extends any grammar formalism in the logic grammar tradition with the expressive power of sorted feature terms.
E95-1025.txt,33,2 The ProFIT Language The set of ProFIT programs is a superset of Prolog programs.
E95-1025.txt,34,While a Prolog program consists only of definite clauses Prolog is an untyped language _comma_ a ProFIT program consists of datatype declarations and definite clauses.
E95-1025.txt,35,The clauses of a ProFIT program can make use of the datatypes sorts_comma_ features_comma_ templates and finite domains that are introduced in the declarations.
E95-1025.txt,36,A ProFIT program consists of Declarations for sorts Declarations for features Declarations for templates Declarations for finite domains Definite clauses 2.1 Sort Declarations In addition to unsorted Prolog terms_comma_ ProFIT allows sorted feature terms_comma_ for which the sorts and features must be declared in advance.
E95-1025.txt,37,The most general sort is top_comma_ and all other sorts must be subsorts of top.
E95-1025.txt,38,Subsort declarations have the syntax given in 1 .
E95-1025.txt,39,The declaration states that all Subi are subsorts of Super_comma_ and that all Subi are mutually exclusive.
E95-1025.txt,41,2Similar_comma_ but less efficient compilation schemes are used in Hirsh s P PATR Hirsh_comma_ 1986 and Covington s GULP system Covington_comma_ 1989 .
E95-1025.txt,42,181 The sort hierarchy must not contain any cycles_comma_ i.e. there must be no sorts A and B_comma_ such that A B_comma_ andA B A.
E95-1025.txt,43,The immediate subsorts of top can be declared to be extensional.
E95-1025.txt,44,Two terms which are of an extensional sort are only identical if they.have a most specific sort which has no subsort _comma_ and if all features are instantiated to ground terms.
E95-1025.txt,45,If a sort is not declared as extensional_comma_ it is intensional.
E95-1025.txt,46,Two intensional terms are identical only if they have been unified.
E95-1025.txt,47,2.2 Feature Declarations Unlike unsorted feature formalisms such as PATRII _comma_ where any feature can be added to any structure_comma_ ProFIT follows the notion of appropriateness in Carpenter s logic of typed feature structures Carpenter_comma_ 1992 _comma_ and introduces features for particular sorts.
E95-1025.txt,48,For each sort_comma_ one must declare which features are introduced by it.
E95-1025.txt,49,The features introduced by a sort are inherited by all its subsorts_comma_ which may also introduce additional features.
E95-1025.txt,50,A feature must be introduced only at one most general sort.
E95-1025.txt,51,This makes it possible to provide a notation in which the sort name can be omitted since it can be inferred from the use of a feature that is appropriate for that sort.
E95-1025.txt,52,This notion of appropriateness is desirable for structuring linguistic knowledge_comma_ as it prevents the ad hoc .
E95-1024.txt,1,novel approach to HPSG based natural language processing is described that uses an off line compiler to automatically prime a declarative grammar for generation or parsing_comma_ and inputs the primed grammar to an advanced Earley style processor. This way we provide an elegant solution to the problems with empty heads and efficient bidirectional processing which is illustrated for the special case of HPSG generation.
E95-1024.txt,2,Extensive testing with a large HPSG grammar revealed some important constraints on the form of the grammar.
E95-1024.txt,4,Bidirectionality of grammar is a research topic in natural language processing that is enjoying increasing attention Strzalkowski_comma_ 1993a .
E95-1024.txt,5,This is mainly due to the clear theoretical and practical advantages of bidirectional grammar use see_comma_ among others_comma_ Appelt_comma_ 1987 .
E95-1024.txt,6,We address this topic in describing a novel approach to HPSG Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 based language processing that uses an off line compiler to automatically prime a declarative grammar for generation or parsing_comma_ and hands the primed grammar to an advanced Earley processor.
E95-1024.txt,7,The developed techniques are direction independent in the sense that they can be used for both generation and parsing with HPSG grammars.
E95-1024.txt,8,In this paper_comma_ we focus on the application of the developed techniques in the context of the comparatively neglected area of HPSG generation.
E95-1024.txt,9,Shieber 1988 gave the first use of Earley s algorithm for generation_comma_ but this algorithm does not The presented research was sponsored by l eilpro jekt B4 Constraints on Grammar for Efficient Generation of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 Sprachtheoretische Grundlagen fiir die Computerllnguistik of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
E95-1024.txt,10,The authors wish to thank Paul King_comma_ Detmar Meurers and Shuly Wintner for valuable comments and discussion.
E95-1024.txt,11,Of course_comma_ the authors are responsible for all remaining errors. use the prediction step to restrict feature instantiations on the predicted phrases_comma_ and thus lacks goaldirectedness.
E95-1024.txt,12,Though Gerdemann 1991 showed how to modify the restriction function to make topdown information available for the bottom up completion step_comma_ Earley generation with top down prediction still has a problem in that generating the subparts of a construction in the wrong order might lead to massive nondeterminacy or even nontermination.
E95-1024.txt,13,Gerdemann 1991 partly overcame this problem by incorpQrating a head driven strategy into Earley s algorithm.
E95-1024.txt,14,However_comma_ evaluating the head of a construction prior to its dependent subparts still suffers from efficiency problems when the head of a construction is either missing_comma_ displaced or underspecified.
E95-1024.txt,15,Furthermore_comma_ Martinovid and Strzalkowski 1992 and others have observed that a simple headfirst reordering of the grammar rules may still make insufficient restricting information available for generation unless the form of the grammar is restricted to unary or binary rules.
E95-1024.txt,16,Strzalkowski s Essential Arguments Approach Ehh 1993b is a top down approach to generation and parsing with logic grammars that uses off line compilation to automatically invert parser oriented logic grammars.
E95-1024.txt,17,The inversion process consists of both the automatic static reordering of nodes in the grammar_comma_ and the interchanging of arguments in rules with recursively defined heads.
E95-1024.txt,18,It is based on the notion of essential arguments_comma_ arguments which must be instantiated to ensure the efficient and terminating execution of a node.
E95-1024.txt,19,Minnen et al. 1995 observe that the EAA is computationally infeasible_comma_ because it demands the investigation of almost all possible permutations of a grammar.
E95-1024.txt,20,Moreover_comma_ the interchanging of arguments in recursive procedures as proposed by Strzalkowski fails to guarantee that input and output grammars are semantically equivalent.
E95-1024.txt,21,The Direct Inversion Approach DI_comma_ of Minnen et al. 1995 overcomes these problems by making the reordering process more goal directed and developing a reformulation technique that allows the successful treatment of rules which exhibit head recursion.
E95-1024.txt,22,Both the EAA and the DIA were 173 presented as approaches to the inversion of parseroriented grammars into grammars suitable for generation.
E95-1024.txt,23,However_comma_ both approaches can just as well take a declarative grammar specification as input to produce generator and or parser oriented grammars as in Dymetman et al. 1990 .
E95-1024.txt,24,In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective.
E95-1024.txt,25,We developed a compiler for off line optimization of phrase structure rule based typed feature structure grammars which generalizes the techniques developed in the context of the DIA_comma_ and we advanced a typed extension of the Earley style generator of Gerdemann 1991 .
E95-1024.txt,26,Off line compilation section 3 is used to produce grammars for the Earley style generator section 2 .
E95-1024.txt,27,We show that our use of offline grammar optimization overcomes problems with empty or displaced heads.
E95-1024.txt,28,The developed techniques are extensively tested with a large HPSG grammar for partial vP topicallzation in German iiinrichs et al._comma_ 1994 .
E95-1024.txt,29,This uncovered some important constraints on the form of the phrase structure rules phrase structure rules in a grammar imposed by the compiler section 4 .
E95-1024.txt,30,2 Advanced Earley Generation As Shieber 1988 noted_comma_ the main shortcoming of Earley generation is a lack of goal directedness that results in a proliferation of edges.
E95-1024.txt,31,Gerdemann 1991 tackled this shortcoming by modifying the restriction function to make top down information available for the bottom up completion step.
E95-1024.txt,32,Gerdemann s generator follows a head driven strategy in order to avoid inefficient evaluation orders.
E95-1024.txt,33,More specifically_comma_ the head of the right hand side of each grammar rule is distinguished_comma_ and distinguished categories are scanned or predicted upon first.
E95-1024.txt,34,The resulting evaluation strategy is similar to that of the head corner approach Shieber et al._comma_ 1990 Gerdemann and IIinrichs_comma_ in press prediction follows the main flow of semantic information until a lexical pivot is reached_comma_ and only then are the headdependent subparts of the construction built up in a bottom up fashion.
E95-1024.txt,35,This mixture of top down and bottom up information flow is crucial since the topdown semantic information from the goal category must be integrated with the bottom up subcategorization information from the lexicon.
E95-1024.txt,36,A strict topdown evaluation strategy suffers from what may be called head recursion_comma_ i.e. the generation analog of left recursion in parsing.
E95-1024.txt,37,Shieber et al. 1990 show that a top down evaluation strategy will fail for rules such as vP  vp x_comma_ irrespective of the order of evaluation of the right hand side categories in the rule.
E95-1024.txt,38,By combining the off line optimization process with a mixed bottom up top down evaluation strategy_comma_ we can refrain from a complete reformulation of the grammar as_comma_ for example_comma_ in Minnen et al. 1995 .
E95-1024.txt,39,2.1 Optimizations We further improved a typed extension of Gerdemann s Earley generator with a number of techniques that reduce the number of edges created during generation.
E95-1024.txt,40,Three optimizations were especially helpful.
E95-1024.txt,41,The first supplies each edge in the chart with two indices_comma_ a backward index pointing to the state in the chart that the edge is predicted from_comma_ and a forward index poinfing to the states that are predicted from the edge.
E95-1024.txt,42,By matching forward and backward indices_comma_ the edges that must be combined for completion can be located faster.
E95-1024.txt,43,This indexing technique_comma_ as illustrated below_comma_ improves upon the more complex indices in Gerdemann 1991 and is closely related to OLDT resolution Tamaki and Sato_comma_ 1986 .
E95-1024.txt,44,1 active Xo Xl X2_comma_1 2 2 active X .Y1Y2_comma_ 3 3 active X2 Y1.Y2_comma_ i_comma_y 4 passive X2  Y1 I 2 o_comma_ 2 Active edge 2 resulted from active edge 1 through prediction.
E95-1024.txt,45,The backward index of edge 2 is therefore identified with the forward index of edge 1.
E95-1024.txt,46,Completion of an active edge results in an edge with identical backward index.
E95-1024.txt,47,In the case of our example_comma_ this would be the steps from edge 2 to edge 3 and edge 3 to edge 4.
E95-1024.txt,48,As nothing gets predicted from a passive edge 4 _comma_ it does not have a forward index.
E95-1024.txt,49,In order to use passive edge 4 for completion of an active edge_comma_ we only need to consider those edges which have a forward index identical to the backward index of 4.
E95-1024.txt,50,The second optimization creates a table of the categories which have been used to make predictions from.
E95-1024.txt,51,As discussed in Gerdemann 1991 _comma_ such a table can be used to avoid redundant predictions without a full and expensive subsumption test.
E95-1024.txt,52,The third indexes lexical entries which is necessary to obtain constant time lexical access.
E95-1024.txt,53,The optimizations of our Earley generator lead to significant gains in efficiency.
E95-1024.txt,54,However_comma_ despite these heuristic improvements_comma_ the problem of goaldirectedness is not solved.
E95-1024.txt,55,2.2 Empty Heads Empty or displaced heads present the principal goaldirectedness problem for any head driven generation approach Shieber et al._comma_ 1990 K6nig_comma_ 1994 Gerdemann and IIinrichs_comma_ in press _comma_ where empty head refers not just to a construction in which the head has an empty phonology_comma_ but to any construction in which the head is partially unspecified.
E95-1024.txt,56,Since 174 phonology does not guide generation_comma_ the phonological realization of the head of a construction plays no part in the generation of that construction.
E95-1024.txt,57,To better illustrate the problem that underspecified heads pose_comma_ consider the sentence Hal Karl Marie geki flt f Has Karl Marie kissed
E95-1024.txt,58,Did Karl kiss Mary for which we adopt the argument composition analysis presented in Hinrichs and Nakazawa 1989 the subeat list of the auxiliary verb is partially instantiated in the lexicon and only becomes fully instantiated upon its combination with its verbal complement_comma_ the main verb.
E95-1024.txt,60,If the generator generates second the main verb then the subcat list of the main verb instantiates the subcat list of the head_comma_ and generation becomes a deterministic procedure in which complements are generated in sequence.
E95-1024.txt,61,However_comma_ if the generator generates second some complement other than the main verb_comma_ then the subcat list of the head contains no restricting information to guide deterministic generation_comma_ and generation becomes a generate and test procedure in which complements are generated at random_comma_ only to be eliminated by further unifications.
E95-1024.txt,62,Clearly then_comma_ the order of evaluation of the complements in a rule can profoundly influence the efficiency of generation_comma_ and an efficient head driven generator must order the evaluation of the complements in a rule accordingly.
E95-1024.txt,63,2.3 Off line versus On line Dynamic_comma_ on line reordering can solve the ordering problem discussed in the previous subsection_comma_ but is rather unattractive interpreting grammar rules at 1For expository reasons_comma_ we refrain from a division between the subject and the other complements of a verb as in chapter 9 of Pollard and Sag 1994 .
E95-1024.txt,64,The test grammar does make this division and always guarantees the correct order of the complements on the comps list with respect to the obliqueness hierarchy.
E95-1036.txt,1,paper presents an analysis of temporal anaphora in sentences which contain quantification over events_comma_ within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory. The analysis in Partee_comma_ 1984 of quantified sentences_comma_ introduced by a temporal connective_comma_ gives the wrong truth conditions when the temporal connective in the subordinate clause is before or after.
E95-1036.txt,2,This problem has been previously analyzed in de Swart_comma_ 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem_comma_ and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach.
E95-1036.txt,3,By using a careful distinction between the different notions of reference time_comma_ based on Kamp and Reyle_comma_ 1993 _comma_ we propose a solution to this problem_comma_ within the framework of Dt T.
E95-1036.txt,4,We show some applications of this solution to additional temporal anaphora phenomena in quantified sentences.
E95-1036.txt,6,The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories.
E95-1036.txt,7,Partee_comma_ 1973 introduced the notion of temporal anaphora_comma_ to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse.
E95-1036.txt,8,In this paper_comma_ we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities.
E95-1036.txt,9,Such interaction_comma_ while interesting in its own right_comma_ is also a good test bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions.
E95-1036.txt,10,We discuss cases such as 1 Before John makes a phone call_comma_ he always lights up a cigarette.
E95-1036.txt,11,Partee_comma_ 1984 2 Often_comma_ when Anne came home late_comma_ Paul had already prepared dinner. de Swart_comma_ 1991 3 When he came home_comma_ he always switched on the tv.
E95-1036.txt,12,He took a beer and sat down in his armchair to forget the day. de Swart_comma_ 1991 4 When John is at the beach_comma_ he always squints when the sun is shining. de Swart_comma_ 1991 The analysis of sentences such as 1 in Partee_comma_ 1984 _comma_ within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory DRT Kamp_comma_ 1981 gives the wrong truth conditions_comma_ when the temporal connective in the sentence is before or after.
E95-1036.txt,13,In DRT_comma_ such sentences trigger box splitting with the eventuality of the subordinate clause and an updated reference time in the antecedent box_comma_ and the eventuality of the main clause in the consequent box_comma_ causing undesirable universal quantification over the reference time.
E95-1036.txt,14,This problem is analyzed in de Swart_comma_ 1991 as an instance of the proportion problem and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach.
E95-1036.txt,15,We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT_comma_ because of DRT s advantages as a general theory of discourse_comma_ and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours_comma_ which deals with sentences such as 1 4_comma_ in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems.
E95-1036.txt,16,In this paper_comma_ we propose such a solution_comma_ based on a careful distinction between different roles of Reichenbach s reference time Reichenbach_comma_ 1947 _comma_ adapted from Kamp and Reyle_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1036.txt,17,Figure 1 shows a minimal pair of DRS s for sentence 1_comma_ one according to Partee s 1984 analysis and one according to ours.
E95-1036.txt,18,2 Background An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference.
E95-1036.txt,19,Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives.
E95-1036.txt,20,These range from temporal instants in Tense logic Prior_comma_ 67 _comma_ through intervals of time Bennet and Partee_comma_ 1978 1972 as in the analysis of temporal connectives in Hein mKki_comma_ 1978 _comma_ to event structures Kamp_comma_ 1979 as in Hinrichs 1986 analysis of temporal anaphora.
E95-1036.txt,22,Still_comma_ the sentence needs to be interpreted relative to a reference time.
E95-1036.txt,23,This reference time can be a large interval_comma_ and should contain each of the relevant occurrences of Mary s telephoning during which Bill was asleep.
E95-1036.txt,24,This reference time is represented as r0 in the top sub DRS.
E95-1036.txt,25,The whenever triggers box splitting.

E95-1034.txt,1,CCG is a combinatory categorial formalism that can capture the syntax and interpretation of free word order in languages such as Turkish. The formalism compositionally derives the predicate argument structure and the information structure e.g. topic_comma_ focus of a sentence_comma_ and uniformly handles word order variation among arguments and adjuncts within a clause_comma_ as well as in complex clauses and across clause boundaries.
E95-1034.txt,3,In this paper_comma_ I present a categorial formalism_comma_ Multiset CCG based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars Steedman_comma_ 1985 Steedman_comma_ 1991 _comma_ that captures the syntax and context dependent interpretation of free word order in languages such as Turkish.
E95-1034.txt,4,Word order variation in relatively free word order languages_comma_ such as Czech_comma_ Finnish_comma_ German_comma_ Japanese_comma_ Korean_comma_ Turkish_comma_ is used to convey distinctions in meaning that go beyond traditional propositional semantics.
E95-1034.txt,5,The word order in these languages serves to structure the information being conveyed to the hearer_comma_ e.g. by indicating what is the topic and the focus of the sentence as will be defined in the next section .
E95-1034.txt,6,In fixed word order languages such as English_comma_ these are indicated largely through intonation and stress rather than word order.
E95-1034.txt,7,The context appropriate use of free word order is of considerable importance in developing practical applications in natural language generation_comma_ machine translation_comma_ and machine assisted translation.
E95-1034.txt,8,I have implemented a database query system in Prolog_comma_ described in Hoffman_comma_ 1994 _comma_ which uses Multiset CCG to interpret and gen crate Turkish sentences with context appropriate word orders.
E95-1034.txt,9,Here_comma_ I concentrate on further devel I would like to thank Mark Steedman_comma_ Ellen Prince_comma_ and the support of NSF Grant SBR 8920230. oping the formalism_comma_ especially to handle complex sentences.
E95-1034.txt,10,There have been other formalisms that integrate information structure into the grammar for free word order languages_comma_ e.g.
E95-1034.txt,11,Sgall et al_comma_ 1986 Engdahl Vallduvi_comma_ 1994 Steinberger_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1034.txt,12,However_comma_ I believe my approach is the first to tackle complex sentences with embedded information structures and discontinuous constituents.
E95-1034.txt,13,Multiset CCG can handle free word order among arguments and adjuncts in all clauses_comma_ as well as word order variation across clause boundaries_comma_ i.e. long distance scrambling.
E95-1034.txt,14,The advantage of using a combinatory categorial formalism is that it provides a compositional and flexible surface structure_comma_ which allows syntactic constituents to easily correspond with information structure units.
E95-1034.txt,15,A novel characteristic of this approach is that the context appropriate use of word order is captured by compositionally building the predicate argument structure AS and the information structure IS of a sentence in parallel.
E95-1034.txt,16,After presenting the motivating Turkish data in Section 2_comma_ I present a competence grammar for Turkish in Section 3 that captures the basic syntactic and semantic relationships between predicates and their arguments or adjuncts while allowing free word order.
E95-1034.txt,17,This grammar_comma_ which derives the predicate argument structure is then integrated with the information structure in Section 4.
E95-1034.txt,18,In Section 5_comma_ the formalism is extended to account for complex sentences and long distance scrambling.
E95-1034.txt,19,2 The Turkish Data The arguments of a verb in Turkish as well as many other free word order languages do not have to occur in a fixed word order.
E95-1034.txt,20,For instance_comma_ all six permutations of the transitive sentence below are possible_comma_ since case marking_comma_ rather than word order_comma_ serves to differentiate the arguments_comma_ a aThe accusative_comma_ dative_comma_ genitive_comma_ ablative_comma_ and locative cases are associated with specific morphemes 245 1 a.

E95-1034.txt,30,Although all the permutations have the same propositional interpretation_comma_ see Fatma_comma_ Ahmet _comma_ each word order conveys a different discourse meaning only appropriate to a specific discourse situation.
E95-1034.txt,31,We can generally associate the sentence initial position with the topic_comma_ the immediately preverbal position with the focus which receives the primary stress in the sentence_comma_ and postverbal positions with backgrounded information Erguvanli_comma_ 1984 .
E95-1034.txt,32,The post verbal positions are influenced by the given new status of entities within the discourse postverbal elements are always evoked discourse entities or are inferrable from entities already evoked in the previous discourse_comma_ and thus_comma_ help to ground the sentence in the current context.
E95-1034.txt,33,I define topic and focus according to their informational status.
E95-1034.txt,34,A sentence can be divided into a topic and a comment_comma_ where the topic is the main element that the sentence is about_comma_ and the comment is the main information we want to convey about this topic.
E95-1034.txt,35,Assuming the heater s discourse model or knowledge store is organized by topics_comma_ the sentence topic can be seen as specifying an address in the heater s knowledge store Reinhart_comma_ 1982 Vallduvi_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1034.txt,36,The informational focus is the most information bearing constituent in the sentence_comma_ Vallduvi_comma_ 1990 it is the new or important information in the sentence within the comment _comma_ and receives prosodic prominence in speech.
E95-1034.txt,37,These information structure components are successful in describing the contextappropriate answer to database queries.
E95-1034.txt,38,In this domain_comma_ the focus is the new or important part of the answer to a wh question_comma_ while the topic is the main entity that the question and answer are both about_comma_ that can be paraphrased using the clause As for X .
E95-1034.txt,39,In other domains_comma_ finding the topic and focus of sentences according to the context may be more complicated.
E95-1034.txt,40,We can now explain why certain word orders are appropriate or inappropriate in a certain context_comma_ in this case database queries.
E95-1034.txt,41,For example_comma_ a speaker may use the SOV order in 2b to answer the wh question in 2a because the speaker wants to focus the new object_comma_ Ahmet_comma_ and so places it in the immediately preverbal position.
E95-1034.txt,42,However_comma_ given a different wh question in 3 _comma_ the subject_comma_ and their vowel harmony variants which attach to the noun nominative case and subject verb agreement for third person singular are unmarked.
E95-1034.txt,43,Fatma_comma_ is the focus of the answer_comma_ while Ahmet is the topic_comma_ a link to the previous context_comma_ and thus the OSV word order is used.

E95-1034.txt,67,Fatma saw Ahmet_comma_ yesterday. Clausal arguments_comma_ just like simple NP arguments_comma_ can occur anywhere in the matrix sentence as long as they are case marked_comma_ 5 a and b.
E95-1034.txt,68,Subordinate verbs in Turkish resemble gerunds in English they take a genitive marked subject and are case marked like NPs_comma_ but they assign structural case to the rest of their arguments like verbs.
E95-1034.txt,69,The arguments and adjuncts within most embedded clause can occur in any word order_comma_ also seen in 5 a and b.
E95-1034.txt,70,In addition_comma_ elements from the embedded clause can occur in matrix clause positions_comma_ i.e. long distance scrambling_comma_ 5c .
E95-1034.txt,71,As indicated by the translations_comma_ word order variation in complex sentences also affects the interpretation.
E95-1034.txt,75,Ay e knows that yesterday_comma_ FATMA left. b.

E95-1034.txt,81,As for Fatma_comma_ Ayae knows that she left YESTERDAY.
E95-1034.txt,82,2In the English translations_comma_ the words in capitals indicate phonological focus.
E95-1034.txt,83,246 The information structure IS is distinct from predicate argument structure AS in languages such as Turkish because adjuncts and elements long distance scrambled from embedded clauses can take part in the IS of the matrix sentence without taking part in the AS of the matrix sentence.
E95-1034.txt,84,As motivated from the data_comma_ a formalism for free word order languages such as Turkish must be flexible enough to handle word order variation among the arguments and the adjuncts in all clauses_comma_ as well as the long distance scrambling of elements from embedded clauses.
E95-1034.txt,85,In addition_comma_ to capture the context appropriate use of word order_comma_ the formalism must associate information structure components such as topic and focus with the appropriate sentence positions_comma_ regardless of the predicate argument structure of the sentence_comma_ and be able to handle the information structure of complex sentences.
E95-1034.txt,86,In the next sections I will present a combinatory categorial formalism which can handle these characteristics of free word order languages.
E95-1034.txt,87,3 Free Word Order Syntax In Multiset CCG 3_comma_ we capture the syntax of free. argument order within a clause by relaxing the subcategorization requirements of a verb so that it does not specify the linear order of its arguments.
E95-1034.txt,88,Each verb is assigned a function category in the lexicon which subcategorizes for a multiset of arguments_comma_ without linear order restrictions.
E95-1034.txt,89,For instance_comma_ a transitive verb has the category SI Nn _comma_ Wa _comma_ a function looking for a set of arguments_comma_ a nominative case noun phrase Nn and an accusative case noun phrase Na _comma_ and resulting in the category S_comma_ a complete sentence_comma_ once it has found these arguments in any order.
E95-1034.txt,90,The syntactic category for verbs provides no hierarchical or precedence information.
E95-1034.txt,91,However_comma_ it is associated with a propositional interpretation that does express the hierarchical ranking of the arguments.
E95-1034.txt,93,These categories are a shorthand forthe many syntactic and semantic features associated with each lexical item.
E95-1034.txt,94,The verbal functions can also specify a direction feature for each of their arguments_comma_ notated in the rules as an arrow above the argument.
E95-1034.txt,95,Thus_comma_ verb final languages such as Korean can be modeled by using this direction feature in verbal categories_comma_ e.g.
E95-1034.txt,97,Multiset CCG contains a small set of rules that combine these categories into larger constituents.
E95-1034.txt,98,The following application rules allow a function 3A preliminary version of the syntactic component of the grammar was presented in Hoffman_comma_ 1992 . such as a verbal category to combine with one of its arguments to its right  or left .
E95-1034.txt,99,We assume that a category X I0 where there are no arguments left in the multiset rewrites by a cleanup rule to just X.

E95-1034.txt,105,Through the use of the composition rules_comma_ Multiset CCGs can handle the free word order of sentential adjuncts.
E95-1034.txt,106,Adjuncts are assigned a function category SI S that can combine with any function that will also result in S_comma_ a complete sentence.
E95-1034.txt,107,The same composition rules allow two verbs to compose together to handle complex sentences with embedded clauses.
E95-1034.txt,108,This will be discussed further in section 5.
E95-1034.txt,110,This captures the fact that simple NPs must be continuous and head final in Turkish.
E95-1034.txt,111,Multiset CCG is flexible enough to handle 4In my implementation of this grammar_comma_ DAGunificatiomis used in the rules.
E95-1034.txt,112,To improve the efficiency of unification and parsing_comma_ the arguments of the categories represented as DAGS are associated with feature labels that indicate their category and case.
E95-1034.txt,113,247 free word order languages that are freer than Turkish_comma_ such as Warlpiri_comma_ through the use of unrestricted composition rules_comma_ but it can also handle languages more restrictive in word order such such as Korean by restricting the categories that can take part in the composition rules.
E95-1034.txt,114,4 The Discourse Meaning of Free Word Order Word order variation in Turkish and other free word order languages is used to express the information structure of a sentence.
E95-1034.txt,115,The grammar presented in the last section determines the predicateargument structure of a sentence_comma_ regardless of word order.
E95-1034.txt,116,In this section_comma_ I add the ordering component of the grammar where the information structure of a sentence is determined.
E95-1034.txt,117,The simple compositional interface described below allows the AS and the IS of a sentence to be derived in parallel.
E95-1034.txt,118,This interface is very similar to Steedman s approach in integrating prosody and syntax in CCGs for English Steedman_comma_ 1991 .
E95-1034.txt,120,Each Multiset CCG category encoding syntactic and semantic properties in the AS is associated with an Ordering Category which encodes the ordering of IS components.
E95-1034.txt,122,Two constituents can combine if and only if i. their syntactic semantic categories can combine using the Multiset CCG application and composition rules_comma_ ii. and their Ordering Categories can combine using the rules below Simple Forward Application  X Y Y  X.
E95-1034.txt,124,Identity  X X X Every verbal category in Multiset CCG is associated with an ordering category_comma_ which serves as a template for the IS.
E95-1034.txt,125,The ordering category in 9 is a function that specifies the components which must be found to complete a possible IS.
E95-1034.txt,126,The forward and backward slashes in the category indicate the direction in which the arguments must be found_comma_ and the parentheses around arguments indicate optionality.
E95-1034.txt,127,The variables T_comma_ F_comma_ G1_comma_ G2 will be unified with the interpretations of the proper constituents in the sentence during the derivation.
E95-1034.txt,131,Using this formalism_comma_ I have implemented a database query system Hoffman_comma_ 994 which generates Turkish sentences with contextappropriate word orders_comma_ in answer to database queries.
E95-1034.txt,132,In generation_comma_ the same topic found in the database query is maintained in the answer.
E95-1034.txt,133,For wh questions_comma_ the information that is retrieved from the database to answer the question becomes the focus of the answer.
E95-1034.txt,134,I have extended the system to also handle yes no questions involving the question morpheme mi _comma_ which is placed next to whatever element is being questioned in the sentence.
E95-1034.txt,135,If the verb is being questioned_comma_ this is a cue that the assertion or negation of the verb will be the focus of the answer 12 a.
E95-1034.txt,136,Ahmet i Fatma gSrdii mii

E95-1034.txt,138,As for Ahmet did Fatma SEE him b.
E95-1034.txt,140,No_comma_ Ahmet Acc Farina see Neg Past.
E95-1034.txt,141,No_comma_ as for Ahmet Farina did NOT see him. In most Turkish sentences_comma_ the immediately preverbal position is prosodically prominent_comma_ and this corresponds with the informational focus.
E95-1034.txt,142,However_comma_ verbs can be focused in Turkish by placing the primary stress of the sentence on the verb instead of immediately preverbal position and by lexical cues such as the placement of the question morpheme.
E95-1034.txt,143,Thus_comma_ we must have more than one IS available for verbs_comma_ where verbs can be in the focus or the ground component of the IS.
E95-1034.txt,144,In addition_comma_ it is possible to focus the whole VP or the whole sentence_comma_ which can be determined by the context_comma_ in this case the database query 13 a.
E95-1034.txt,145,Bugiin Fatma ne yapacak

E95-1034.txt,149,Today Fatma book read fut.
E95-1034.txt,151,Multiset CCG can recover the appropriate predicate argument relations of the embedded clause and the matrix clause even when the arguments occur out of the domain of the subordinate verb.
E95-1034.txt,152,The composition rules allow two verb categories with multisets of arguments to combine together.
E95-1034.txt,153,As the two verbs combine_comma_ their arguments collapse into one argument set in the syntactic representation.
E95-1034.txt,154,As seen in the derivation below_comma_ we compose the verbs together to form a complex verbM function_comma_ which can then apply to the arguments of both verbs in any order.
E95-1034.txt,157,Ay e knows that Fatma left yesterday. b.
E95-1034.txt,165,The propositional interpretation of the subordinate clause is embedded into the interpretation of the matrix clause.
E95-1034.txt,166,The syntactic component of Multiset CCGs correctly rules out long distance scrambling to the immediately preverbal matrix position_comma_ because elements from the embedded clause cannot combine with the matrix verb before the matrix verb has combined with the embedded verb.
E95-1034.txt,169,SN I Ng_comma_Na Nn Ng SI Nn_comma_ SN XXXLong distance scrambling to the sentence initial position and post verbal position in the matrix clause is handled through the composition of the verbs_comma_ as seen in Figure 2.
E95-1034.txt,170,The ordering component of Multiset CCG allows individual elements from subordinate clauses to be components in the IS of the matrix clause.
E95-1034.txt,171,This is because the ordering category for a matrix verb does not specify that its components be arguments in its AS.
E95-1034.txt,172,In the sentence in Figure 2_comma_ Fatma _comma_ an argument of the embedded clause_comma_ has been scrambled into the topic position of the matrix clause.
E95-1034.txt,173,The derivation with both components of the grammar working in parallel is shown in Figure 2.
E95-1034.txt,174,The embedded verb must first complete its IS IS2 then_comma_ the two verbs compose together_comma_ and the subordinate IS is embedded into the matrix IS SI .
E95-1034.txt,175,The complex verbal constituent can then combine with the rest of the arguments of both verbs in any order.
E95-1034.txt,176,The linear order of the two NP arguments will determine which components of the matrix IS each fill.
E95-1034.txt,181,Do you know the man who came yesterday from Ankara 19 a.
E95-1034.txt,184,When Berna finishes her homework_comma_ she is going to help me. b.
E95-1034.txt,189,6 Conclusions I have presented a combinatory.categorial formalism that can account for both the syntax and interpretation of free word order in Turkish.
E95-1034.txt,190,The syntactic component of Multiset CCG is flexible enough to derive the predicate argument structure of simple and complex sentences without relying on word order_comma_ and it is expressive enough to capture syntactic restrictions on word order in different languages such as languages with NP or clausal islands or languages which allow discontinuous NPs or clauses.
E95-1034.txt,191,Word order is used in the ordering component of Multiset CCG to determine the information structure of a sentence.
E95-1034.txt,192,Every Multiset CCG category encoding syntactic and semantic properties is associated with an ordering category which encodes the ordering of information structure components such as topic and focus two syntactic semantic categories are allowed to combine to form a larger constituent only if their ordering categories can also combine.
E95-1034.txt,193,The formalism has been implemented within a database query task in Quintus Prolog_comma_ to interpret and generate simple and complex sentences with context appropriate word orders.
E95-1034.txt,194,Multiset CCG captures the context appropriate use of word order by compositionally deriving the predicate argument structure and the information structure of a sentence in parallel.
E95-1034.txt,195,It allows adjuncts and elements from embedded clauses to take part in the information structure of the matrix clause_comma_ even though they do not take part in its predicate argument structure.
E95-1034.txt,196,Thus_comma_ this formalism provides a uniform approach in capturing the syntactic and pragmatic aspects of word order variation among arguments and adjuncts_comma_ and across clause boundaries. .
E95-1018.txt,1,work within the field of Categorial Grammar has seen the development of approaches that allow different modes of logical behaviour to be displayed within a single system_comma_ something corresponding to making available differing modes of linguistic description. Earlier attempts to achieve this goal have employed modal operators called structural modalities_comma_ whose use presents a number of problems.
E95-1018.txt,2,I pro . pose an alternative approach_comma_ involving coexistence and interrelation of different sublogics_comma_ that eliminates the need for structural modalities_comma_ whilst maintaining the descriptive power they provide.
E95-1018.txt,4,Categorial Grammar formalisms consist of logics.
E95-1018.txt,5,Syntactic information e.g. subcategorisation_comma_ word order is encoded in complex formulas or types assigned to lexical items.
E95-1018.txt,6,Syntactic derivation is via deduction over lexical formulas.
E95-1018.txt,7,Alternative systems differ in the logics they use_comma_ x which may he classified by their limitations on the use of resources i.e. assumptions in deduction_comma_ and their consequent sensitivity to the specific structuring of those resources a comparison which gives rise to the substructural hierarchy of logics .
E95-1018.txt,8,In linguistic terms_comma_ such logics can be seen to implement different possible views of the nature of linguistic structure.
E95-1018.txt,9,In the past few years_comma_ categorial systems have been developed that allow access to the resource behaviour of more than one level of the substructural hierarchy.
E95-1018.txt,10,This amounts to a recognition The author also at Department of Psychology_comma_ Sheffield University.
E95-1018.txt,11,The research reported here was done largely during a year at IRCS_comma_ UPenn_comma_ with the support of an IRCS Postdoctoral Fellowship award.
E95-1018.txt,12,I would like to thank Ruth Kempson_comma_ Natasha Kurtonins_comma_ Michael Moortgat_comma_ Glyn Morrill and Yde Venema for valuable discussions of the ideas in this paper.
E95-1018.txt,13,1 For example_comma_ associative Lambek calculus Lambek 1958 _comma_ non associative Lambek calculus Lambek 1961 _comma_ a permutative variant of associative Lambek calculus known as LP van Benthem 1983 _comma_ the headed systems of Moortgat Morrill 1991 . that a full account of phenomena within a language may require use of more than one notion of linguistic structure_comma_ so that e.g. rigid treelike structures may be appropriate for one class of phenomena binding_comma_ perhaps _comma_ whereas more flexible structures may be appropriate for another coordination_comma_ perhaps .
E95-1018.txt,14,Consideration of crosslinguistic variation strengthens the case for allowing multiple notions of structure.
E95-1018.txt,15,One approach to creating systems with mixed resource behaviour employs operators called structural modalities.
E95-1018.txt,16,In such work_comma_ a specific resource logic is selected as basic for stating the grammar_comma_ thereby setting the default characteristics of resource sensitivity.
E95-1018.txt,17,Then_comma_ structural modalities are used to allow controlled access to the resource behaviour of other substructural levels.
E95-1018.txt,18,Various problems theoretical_comma_ computational and practical arise for the use of such operators.
E95-1018.txt,19,For example_comma_ where they are used extensively_comma_ unduly complicated accounts tend to result.
E95-1018.txt,20,Also_comma_ the need to have a single base logic presents problems for the development of a truly general cross linguistic framework.
E95-1018.txt,21,More recent work has seen the development of approaches that have coexistence of different sublogics within a single mixed or multimodal system.
E95-1018.txt,22,2 Moortgat Oehrle 1993 1994 and Hepple 1993 propose general approaches for combining substructural logics into multimodal systems_comma_ where movement between levels enabled by structural modalities in the earlier work is freely allowed_comma_ provided it accords with what are seen to be natural relations between the levels in terms of the relative informativeness of their descriptions.
E95-1018.txt,23,Although developed separately_comma_ these two sources propose formal systems that are in many ways similar_comma_ but_comma_ interestingly_comma_ take precisely opposing views as to what are the natural relations between levels.
E95-1018.txt,24,This difference of opinion has consequences for how the systems may be used as linguistic formalisms requiring_comma_ for ex2Some early examples of muitimodal systems are logics that have coexistence_comma_ but without interlinkage_comma_ of associative and non associative Lambek calculus Oehrle Zhang 1989 Morrill 1990 .
E95-1018.txt,25,Further examples include systems that combine associative Lambek calculus with special connectives for discontinuity e.g. Morrill Solias 1993 Hepple 1994 .
E95-1018.txt,26,127 ample_comma_ additional apparatus for handling word order in the second approach _comma_ and more crucially for the kind of linguistic accounts they allow to be formulated.
E95-1018.txt,27,In this paper_comma_ I will describe the approach taken in Hepple 1993  what I call the hybrid approach_comma_ discuss the general linguistic model that it tends to foster and provide some linguistic illustration_comma_ and discuss possibilities for parsing hybrid systems.
E95-1018.txt,28,I will begin with discussion of substructural hierarchy and structural modalities_comma_ as it is the behaviour of systems with structural modalities that inspires the hybrid view of how different levels should be related.
E95-1018.txt,29,2 The substructural hierarchy I will address only logics or levels having three connectives a product connective a form of conjunction_comma_ corresponding to matter like addition of substructures _comma_ plus two implicational connectives the left and right residuals of the product _comma_ notated as L_comma_ and o for a product o.
E95-1018.txt,33,Note that this formulation includes a system of term 3A sequent F  A indicates that the succedent formula A can be derived from the structured configuration of antecedent formulas F.
E95-1018.txt,35,Such terms play an important role in the approach to be developed.
E95-1018.txt,36,The system of term labelling has the following features.
E95-1018.txt,37,All antecedent formulas are associated with variables.
E95-1018.txt,39,For implicational connectives_comma_ Left and Right inferences are interpreted via functional application and .
E95-1026.txt,1,present the dialogue component of the speech to speech translation system VERBMOBIL. In contrast to conventional dialogue systems it mediates the dialogue while processing maximally 50 of the dialogue in depth.
E95-1026.txt,2,Special requirements robustness and efficiency lead to a 3 layered hybrid architecture for the dialogue module_comma_ using statistics_comma_ an automaton and a planner.
E95-1026.txt,3,A dialogue memory is constructed incrementally.
E95-1026.txt,5,VERBMOBIL combines the two key technologies speech processing and machine translation.
E95-1026.txt,6,The long term goal of this project is the development of a prototype for the translation of spoken dialogues between two persons who want to find a date for a business meeting for more detail on the objectives of VERBMOBIL see Wahlster_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1026.txt,7,A special characteristic of VERBMOBIL is that both participants are assumed to have at least a passive knowledge of English which is used as intermediate language.
E95-1026.txt,8,Translations are produced on demand so that only parts of the dialogue are processed.
E95-1026.txt,9,If VERBMOBIL is inactive_comma_ shallow processing by a keyword spotter takes place which allows the system to follow the dialogue at least partially.
E95-1026.txt,10,In this paper focus is on the description of the dialogue component_comma_ which processes the interaction of the two dialogue partners and builds a representation of the discourse.
E95-1026.txt,11,Dialogue processing in VERBMOBIL differs from systems_comma_like SUNDIAL Andry_comma_ 1992 in two important points 1 VERBMOBIL mediates the dialogue between two human dialogue participants the system is not a participant of its own_comma_ i.e. it does not control the dialogue as it happens in the flight scheduling scenario of SUNDIAL 2 VERBMOBIL processes maximally 50 of the dialogue contributions in depth_comma_ The research within VERBMOBIL presented here is funded by the German Ministry of Research and Technology under grant 011V101K 1.
E95-1026.txt,12,i.e. when the owner of VERBMOBIL speaks German only.
E95-1026.txt,13,The rest of the dialogue can only be followed by a keyword spotter.
E95-1026.txt,14,In the remainder of this paper first the requirements of the VERBMOBIL setting with respect to functionality and design of the dialogue component section are introduced.
E95-1026.txt,15,Then a hybrid architecture for the dialogue component and its embedding into the VERBMOBIL prototype are discussed.
E95-1026.txt,16,Finally_comma_ results from our implemented system are presented.
E95-1026.txt,17,We conclude with an outline of future extensions.
E95-1026.txt,18,2 Tasks of the Dialogue Component The dialogue component within VERBMOBIL has four mQor tasks 1 to support speech recognition and linguistic analysis when processing the speech signal.
E95-1026.txt,19,Top down predictions can be made to restrict the search space of other analysis components to get better results in shorter time Young et al._comma_ 1989 Andry_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1026.txt,20,For instance_comma_ predictions about a speech act can be used to narrow down the set of words which are likely to occur in the following utterance a fact exploited by the speech recognition component which uses adaptive language models Jellinek_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1026.txt,21,Top down predictions are also used to limit the set of applicable grammar rules to a specific subgrammar.
E95-1026.txt,22,They are of particular importance since the system has to work under real time constraints.
E95-1026.txt,23,2 to provide contextual information for other VERBMOBIL components.
E95-1026.txt,24,In order to get good translations_comma_ context plays an important role.
E95-1026.txt,25,One example is the translation of the German Geht es bei Ihnen which can be translated as Does it suit you or How about your place _comma_ depending on whether the dialogue partners discussed a time or a place before.
E95-1026.txt,26,A discourse history is constructed which can be accessed by other VP.RBMOBIL components Ripplinger and Caroli_comma_ 1994 LuperFoy and Rich_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1026.txt,27,3 to follow the dialogue when V .RBMOBIL is off line.
E95-1026.txt,28,When both dialogue participants speak 188 English and no automatic translation is necessary VERBMOBIL is passive _comma_ i.e. no syntactic or semantic analyses are performed.
E95-1026.txt,29,In such cases_comma_ the dialogue component tries to follow the dialogue by using a keyword spotter.
E95-1026.txt,30,This device scans the input for a small set of predetermined words which are characteristic for certain stages of the dialogue.
E95-1026.txt,31,The dialogue component computes the most probable speech act type of the next utterance in order to selects its typical key words.
E95-1026.txt,32,4 to control clarification dialogues between VERBMOBIL and its users.
E95-1026.txt,33,If processing breaks down VERBMOBIL has to initiate a clarification dialogue in order to recover.
E95-1026.txt,34,3 The Architecture Planner I FSM 1 Statistics Dialogue Memory Intel Refer mtlal StnJcture .
E95-1026.txt,36,i Generation I Figure 1 Architecture of the dialogue module The abovementioned requirements cannot be met when using a single method of processing if we use structural knowledge sources like plans or dialogue grammars_comma_ top down predictions are difficult make_comma_ because usually one can infer many possible follow up speech acts from such knowledge sources that are not scored Nagata and Morimoto_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1026.txt,37,Also_comma_ a planning only approach is inappropriate when the dialogue is processed only partially.
E95-1026.txt,38,Therefore we chose a hybrid 3 layered approach see fig. 1 where the layers differ with respect to the type of knowledge they use and the task they are responsible for.
E95-1026.txt,39,The components are A Statistic Module The task of the statistic module is the prediction of the following speech act_comma_ using knowledge about speech act frequencies in our training corpus.
E95-1026.txt,40,A Finite State Machine FSM The finite state machine describes the sequence of speech acts that are admissible in a standard appointment scheduling dialogue and checks the ongoing dialogue whether it follows these expectations see fig. 2 .
E95-1026.txt,41,A Planner The hierarchical planner constructs a description of the dialogue s underlying dialogue and thematic structures_comma_ making extensive use of contextual knowledge.
E95-1026.txt,42,This module is sensitive to inconsistencies and therefore robustness and backup strategies are the most important features of this component.
E95-1026.txt,43,While the statistical component completely relies on numerical information and is able to provide scored predictions in a fast and efficient way_comma_ the planner handles time intensive tasks exploiting various knowledge sources_comma_ in particular linguistic information.
E95-1026.txt,44,The FSM can be located in between these two components it works like an efficient parser for the detection of inconsistent dialogue states.
E95-1026.txt,45,The three modules interact in cases of repair_comma_ e.g. when the planner needs statistical information to resume an incongruent dialogue.
E95-1026.txt,46,On the input side the dialogue component is interfaced with the output from the semantic construction evaluation module_comma_ which is a Drts like feature value structure Bos et al._comma_ 1994 containing syntactic_comma_ semantic_comma_ and occasionally pragmatic information.
E95-1026.txt,47,The input also includes information from the generation component about the utterance produced in the target language and a word lattice from the keyword spotter.
E95-1026.txt,48,The output of the dialogue module is delivered to any module that needs information about the dialogue pursued so far_comma_ as for example the transfer module and the semantic construction evaluation module.
E95-1026.txt,49,Additionally_comma_ the keyword spotter is provided with words expected in the next utterance.
E95-1026.txt,50,4 Layered Dialogue Processing 4.1 Knowledge Based Layers 4.1.1 The Underlying Knowledge Source The Dialogue Model Like previous approaches for modeling taskoriented dialogues we base our ideas on the assumption that a dialogue can be described by means of a limited but open set of speech acts e.g. Bilange_comma_ 1991 _comma_ Mast_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1026.txt,51,As point of departure we take speech acts as proposed by Austin_comma_ 1962 and Searle_comma_ 1969 and also a number of so called illocutionary acts as employed in a model of information seeking dialogues Sitter and Stein_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1026.txt,52,We examined the VERBMOBIL corpus of appointment_comma_ scheduling dialogues for their occurrence and for the necessity to introduce new speech acts 1 .
E95-1026.txt,53,At present_comma__comma_ our model contains 17 speech acts see Maier_comma_ 1994 for more details on the characterization of the various speech acts the dialogue model describing admissible sequences of z The acts we introduce below are mostly of illocutionary nature.
E95-1026.txt,54,Nevertheless we will refer to them as speech acts throughout this paper.
E95-1026.txt,55,189 speech acts is given in fig. 2 .
E95-1026.txt,56,Among the domaindependent speech acts there are low level primitive speech acts like BEC RUESSUNG for initiating and VERABSCHIEDUNG for concluding a dialogue.
E95-1026.txt,57,Among the domain independent speech acts we use acts as e.g.
E95-1026.txt,58,AKZEPTANZ and ABLEHNUNG.
E95-1026.txt,59,Additionally_comma_ we introduced two speech acts necessary for modeling our appointment scheduling dialogues INIT_TERMINABSPRACHE and BESTAETIGUNG.
E95-1026.txt,60,While the first is used to describe utterances which state date s or places to be negotiated_comma_ the latter corresponds to contributions that contain a mutual agreement concerning a given topic.
E95-1026.txt,62,Stellung Bestaetigung Dank Vomchlag.
E95-1027.txt,1,this paper we describe an architecture and functionality of main components of a workbench for an acquisition of domain knowledge from large text corpora. The workbench supports an incremental process of corpus analysis starting from a rough automatic extraction and organization of lexico semantic regularities and ending with a computer supported analysis of extracted data and a semiautomatic refinement of obtained hypotheses.
E95-1027.txt,2,For doing this the workbench employs methods from computational linguistics_comma_ information retrieval and knowledge engineering.
E95-1027.txt,3,Although the workbench is currently under implementation some of its components are already implemented and their performance is illustrated with samples from engineering for a medical domain.
E95-1027.txt,5,One of the standard methods for the extraction of domain knowledge or domain schema in another terminology from texts is known as Distributional Analysis Hirshman 1986 .
E95-1027.txt,6,It is based on the identification of the sublanguage specific cooccurrence properties of words in the syntactic relations in which they occur in the texts.
E95-1027.txt,7,These cooccurrence properties indicate important semantic characteristics of the domain classes of objects and their hierarchical inclusion_comma_ properties of these classes_comma_ relations among them_comma_ lexicosemantic patterns for referring to certain conceptual propositions_comma_ etc. This knowledge about domain in the form it is extracted is not quite suitable to be included into the knowledge base and require a post processing of the linguistically trained knowledge engineer.
E95-1027.txt,8,This is known as a conceptual analysis of the acquired lingistic data.
E95-1027.txt,9,In general all this is a time consuming process and often requires the help of a domain expert.
E95-1027.txt,10,However_comma_ it seems to be possible to automate some tasks and facilitate human intervention in many parts using a combination of NLP and statistical techniques for data extraction_comma_ type oriented patterns for conceptual characterization of this data and an intuitive user interface.
E95-1027.txt,11,All these resources are to be put together into a Knowledge Acquisition Workbench KAWB which is under development at LTG of the University of Edinburgh.
E95-1027.txt,12,The workbench supports an incremental process of corpus analysis starting from a rough automatic extraction and organization of lexico semantic regularities and ending with a computer supported analysis of extracted data and a refinement of obtained hypotheses.
E95-1027.txt,13,2 KAW Architecture The workbench we are aiming at integrates computational tools and a user interface to support phases of data extraction_comma_ data analysis and hypotheses refinement.
E95-1027.txt,14,The target domain description consists of words grouped into domain specific semantic categories which can be further refined into a conceptual type lattice CTL and lexicosemantic patterns further refined into conceptual structures as shown elsewhere in the paper.
E95-1027.txt,15,KAW architecture is displayed in figure 1.
E95-1027.txt,16,A data extraction module provides the knowledge engineer with manageable units of lexical data words_comma_ phrases etc. grouped together according to certain semantically important properties.
E95-1027.txt,17,The data extraction phase can be subdivided into a stage of semantic category identification and a stage of lexico semantic pattern extraction.
E95-1027.txt,18,Both of these stages complement each other the discovery of semantic categories allows the system to look for patterns and discovered patterns serve as diagnostic units for further extraction of these categories.
E95-1027.txt,19,Thus both these activities can be applied iteratively until a certain level of precision and coverage is achieved.

E95-1027.txt,21,195 The word class identification component encompasses tools for the linguistic annotation of texts_comma_ word clustering tools and tools for access to external linguistic and semantic sources like thesauri_comma_ machine readable dictionaries and lexical data bases.
E95-1027.txt,22,Statistical clustering can be automatically checked and subcategorized with the help of external linguistic and semantic sources.
E95-1027.txt,23,The pattern finder component makes use of phrasal annotations of texts produced by a general robust partial parser.
E95-1027.txt,24,First_comma_ the corpus is checked for stable phrasal collocations for single words and entire semantic clusters by a special tool a collocator.
E95-1027.txt,25,After collocations are collected another tool a generalizer tries automatically deduce regularities and contract multiple patterns into their general representations.
E95-1027.txt,26,Such patterns are then presented for a conceptual characterization to the knowledge engineer and some predefined generic conceptual structures are suggested for specialization.
E95-1027.txt,27,The main aim of the analysis and refinement module is to uncover and refine structural generalities found in the previous phases.
E95-1027.txt,28,It matches in the text patterns which represent hypotheses of the knowledge engineer_comma_ groups together and generalizes the found cases and presents them to the knowledge engineer for a final decision.
E95-1027.txt,29,The matcher evaluates how good a given piece of text matches the pattern and returns matches at various levels of exactness.
E95-1027.txt,30,If modules are to communicate flexibly then an inter module information representation format needs to be specified.
E95-1027.txt,31,Standard Generalized Markup Language Goldfab 1990 is an international standard for marking up text.
E95-1027.txt,32,We use SGML as a way of exchanging information between modules in a knowledge acquisition system_comma_ and of storing that information in persistent store when it has been processed.
E95-1027.txt,33,In the rest of the paper we will embark on a more detailed characterization of tools themselves.
E95-1027.txt,34,We_comma_ however_comma_ will not present any technical details and suggestions on an actual implementation because the workbench should be able to incorporate different implementations .
E95-1027.txt,35,Some of the tools axe already implemented while others still need implementation or reimplementation in terms of the open architecture of the workbench.
E95-1027.txt,36,For an illustration we have used samples from engineering for the cardiac failure domain using OHSUMED Hersh 1994 corpus and a corpus of patient discharge summaries PDS described in Mikheev 1994.
E95-1027.txt,37,3 Linguistic Annotation The simplest form of linguistic description of the content of a machine readable document is in the form of a sequence or a set of words.
E95-1027.txt,38,More sophisticated linguistic information comes in several forms_comma_ all of which may need to be represented if performance in an automatic acquisition of lexical regularities is to be improved.
E95-1027.txt,39,The NLP module of the KAWB consists of a word tagger e.g. Kupiec 1993 _comma_ a specialized partial robust parser and a case attachment module.
E95-1027.txt,40,The tagger assigns categorial features to words.
E95-1027.txt,41,This is not a straightforward process due to the general lexical ambiguity of any natural language but state of the art taggers do this quite well more than 97 correctness using different strategies usually based on an application of Hidden Markov Models HMMs .
E95-1027.txt,42,It is well known that a general text parsing is very fragile and ambiguous by its nature.
E95-1027.txt,43,Syntactic ambiguity can lead to hundreds of parses even for fairly simple sentences.
E95-1027.txt,44,This is clearly inappropriate.
E95-1027.txt,45,However_comma_ general and full scale parsing is not required for many tasks of knowledge acquisition but rather a robust identification of certain text segments is needed.
E95-1027.txt,46,Among these segments are compound noun phrases_comma_ verb phrases etc. To increase a precision of knowledge extraction in some cases it is quite important to resolve .
E95-1002.txt,1,paper presents a constraint based semantic formalism for HPSG. The syntax semantics interface directly implements syntactic conditions on quantifier scoping and distributivity.
E95-1002.txt,2,1 The construction of semantic representations is guided by general principles governing the interaction between syntax and semantics.
E95-1002.txt,3,Each of these principles acts as a constraint to narrow down the set of possible interpretations of a sentence.
E95-1002.txt,4,Meanings of ambiguous sentences are represented by single partial representations so called U nderspecified D iscourse R epresentation S tructure s to which further constraints can be added monotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence.
E95-1002.txt,5,There is no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the sentence which are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world knowledge.
E95-1002.txt,6,The advantage of UDRSs is not only that they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation but also that they are equipped with truth conditions and a proof theory that allows for inferences to be drawn directly on structures where quantifier scope is not resolved.
E95-1002.txt,8,The semantic analysis of standard HPSG deviates from the familiar Montegovian way to construct semantic representations mainly in that it uses unification to eliminate the need for 13 reduction.
E95-1002.txt,9,Variables 1In the present paper we do only focus on simple principles restricting scope ambiguities and ambiguities resulting from plural NPs in English.
E95-1002.txt,10,For German restrictions on scope are much more complicated because they cannot be stated independently of scrambling phenomena.
E95-1002.txt,11,In l ank Reyle 1994 the present approach is worked out for a fragment of German that deals with i quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by scrambling and or movement and ii ambiguities that arise from the collective distributive distinction of plural NPs.
E95-1002.txt,12,The underlying scope theory for German was developed in Frey 1993 .
E95-1002.txt,13,The analysis in Frank Reyle 1994 departs significantly from our earlier account in Frank Reyle 1992 _comma_ where monotonicity was not ensured.
E95-1002.txt,14,9 are bound to argument positions by the close interplay between syntactic and semantic processing and the semantics of constituents is determined by the Semantics Principle_comma_ which governs the way of unifying the semantics of daughter constituents to build up the semantic value of the phrasal constituent The CONTENT value is projected from the semantic head_comma_ which is defined as the syntactic HEADDTR in head comp structures_comma_ but as the ADJ DTR in head adjunct structures.
E95-1002.txt,15,It is important to note that the semantic contribution of quantified verb arguments is not completely projected as part of the CONTENT value.
E95-1002.txt,16,The meaning of such NPs splits into the features QUANTS_comma_ a list representing the information about quantifier scope_comma_ and NUCLEUS_comma_ containing the nonquantificational core.
E95-1002.txt,17,In the general case only the NUCLEUS is projected from the semantic head according to the Semantics Principle_comma_ while the QUANTS value gets instantiated stepwisc in interaction with the quantifier storage mechanism Cooper Store .
E95-1002.txt,18,The mechanism of Cooper storage is built into HPSG by use of two further attributes_comma_ QSTORE and RETRIEVED_comma_ both represented as sets of quantifiers.
E95-1002.txt,19,All quantifiers start out in QSTORE by lexical definition.
E95-1002.txt,20,The Semantics Principle defines the inheritance of QSTORE to the phrasal constituents_comma_ where they may be taken out of store by an appropriately instantiated RETRIEVED value and then put into the QUANTS value of the CONTENT feature.
E95-1002.txt,21,The order in which the semantic value of quantified NPs is retrieved fixes their relative scope.
E95-1002.txt,22,To analyse sentences with scope ambiguities several parses are thus necessary.
E95-1002.txt,23,Besides the definition of appropriate restrictions to and configurations for applications of RETRIEVED the main problem we face with this kind of analysis is to modify the semantics of HPSG in such a way that it yields underspecificd representations and not sets of fully specified ones.
E95-1002.txt,24,Further shortcomings of HPSG semantics are the following.
E95-1002.txt,25,First_comma_ adjuncts like quantificationai adverbs_comma_ modals and also negation bear the potential to introduce scope ambiguities.
E95-1002.txt,26,In order to treat them by the same mechanism that treats the arguments of the verb their meaning representation would have to be put into store.
E95-1002.txt,27,This_comma_ however_comma_ requires further modifications of the Semantics Principle_comma_ because the treatment of head adjunct structures differs essentially from the treatment of other configurations see Pollard Sag 1994 _comma_ Ch.8 .
E95-1002.txt,28,2 Second_comma_ there is no underspecified representation of ambiguities that arise from the distributive collective distinction of plural NPs neither within the HPSG framework nor in the C ore L anguage E ngine 3 .
E95-1002.txt,29,Third_comma_ the semantic representation of indefinite NPs must be independent of the context in which they are interpreted.
E95-1002.txt,30,We do not want to switch from a universally quantified interpretation to an existentially quantified one_comma_ when we come to disambiguate the ambiguous sentence Every student who admires a philosopher reads his original writings such that a philosopher is interpreted specifically.
E95-1002.txt,31,This requirement calls for DRT as underlying semantic formalism.
E95-1002.txt,32,In the sequel of this paper we show how the extension of DRT to UDRT developed in Reyle 1993 can be combined with an HPSG style grammar.
E95-1002.txt,33,The basic idea of the combination being that syntax as well as semantics provide structures of equal right that the principles internal to the syntactic and semantic level are motivated only by the syntactic and semantic theory_comma_ respectively and that mutually constraining relations between syntax and semantics are governed by a separate set of principles that relate syntactic and semantic information appropriately.
E95-1002.txt,34,We will replace the Semantics Principle of standard HPSG versions by a principle which directly reflects the monotonicity underlying the interpretation process designed in Reyle 1993 At any stage of the derivation more details are added to the description of the semantic relations between the various components of the sentence_comma_ i.e. the partial representation of any mother node is the union of the partial representations of its daughter nodes plus further constraints derived from the syntactic_comma_ semantic and also pragmatic context.
E95-1002.txt,35,2 Quantifier Scope and Partial Orders The need for underspecified representations is by now widely accepted within computational and theoretical linguistics.
E95-1002.txt,36,4 To make the results of the ongoing research on underspecified representations available for HPSG we may pursue two strategies.
E95-1002.txt,37,According to the first strategy we take the HPSGstyle analysis essentially as it is and only ap2For general criticism of the analysis of adjuncts in standard HPSG see Abb Maienborn 1994 .
E95-1002.txt,38,Their analysis of adjuncts in HPSG fits neatly into the account of semantics projection to be presented below.
E95-1002.txt,39,3See Alshawi 1992 .
E95-1002.txt,40,In CLE the resolution of QLFs also involves disambiguation with respect to this kind of ambiguities.
E95-1002.txt,41,4See Peters vanDeemter 1995 for recent discussion. ply slight modifications to produce underspecified output.
E95-1002.txt,42,The second strategy involves a more radical change as it takes an existing theory of underspecifled representations and replaces the HPSG semantics by the construction principles of this theory.
E95-1002.txt,43,Let us start out with a sketch of the first approach.
E95-1002.txt,44,It will show us where its limitations are and allow us to compare different approaches to underspecification.
E95-1002.txt,45,The first thing to do_comma_ when un specifying HPSG semantics_comma_ is to relax the retrieval operation.
E95-1002.txt,46,This must be done in two respects.
E95-1002.txt,47,First_comma_ we must allow NP meanings not to be retrieved at all.
E95-1002.txt,48,This results in their relative scope not being determined.
E95-1002.txt,49,Second_comma_ we must accommodate syntactic and semantic restrictions on possible scope relations to be stated by the grammar.
E95-1002.txt,50,5 Restrictions specifying_comma_ for example_comma_ that the subject NP must always have wide scope over the other arguments of the verb or_comma_ that the scope of genuinely quantified NPs is clause bounded.
E95-1002.txt,51,The modifications we propose are the following.
E95-1002.txt,52,First_comma_ we incorporate the QSTORE feature into the CONTENT feature structure.
E95-1002.txt,53,This makes the NP meanings available even if they are not retrieved from QSTORE.
E95-1002.txt,54,Second_comma_ we take the value of the QUANTS feature not to be a stack i.e. by appending new retrieved quantifiers as first elements to QUANTS _comma_ but allow any NP meaning that is retrieved at a later stage to be inserted at any place in that list.
E95-1002.txt,55,This means that the order of NP meanings in QUANTS fixes the relative scope of these meanings only it does not imply that they have narrow scope with respect to the NP meaning that will be retrieved next.
E95-1002.txt,56,But this is not yet enough to implement clause boundedness.
E95-1002.txt,57,The easiest way to formulate this restriction is to prohibit projection of quantified NP meanings across bounding nodes.
E95-1002.txt,58,Thus the QSTORE and QUANTS values of a bounding node inherit the quantificational information only of indefinite NPs and not of generalized quantifiers.
E95-1002.txt,59,To be more precise_comma_ let us consider the tree 3 consisting only of the bounding nodes in the syntactic analysis of a sentence 3 .
E95-1002.txt,60,Then the semantic content of can be associated with nodes of in the following way.
E95-1002.txt,61,For each node i of fl the attributes QUANTS_comma_ QSTORE and NUCLEUS have values quantsi_comma_ qstorei and nucleusi.
E95-1002.txt,62,The relative scope between scope bearing phrases of _comma_ i.e. between the elements of Ui quantsiUqstorei can then be defined as follows. If Q1 and Q2 are in quantsi and Q1 precedes Q2_comma_ then Q1 has scope over Q2. If Qa is in quantsi and Q2 in quantsj_comma_ where i dominates j_comma_ then Q1 has scope over Q2. If Q1 is in qstorei and not in qstorej_comma_ where i dominates j_comma_ then Qa has scope over any Q2 in qstorejUquantsj that are not in qstoreiUquantsi.
E95-1002.txt,63,5This has to be done also for the standard theory.
E95-1002.txt,64,10 Tim last clause says that any NP Q1 occurring in the clause of level i and that is still in QSTORE has scope over all quantified NPs Q2 occurring in embedded clauses i.e. clauses of level j .
E95-1002.txt,65,But Q1 does not necessarily have scope over any indefinite NP introduced at level j.
E95-1002.txt,66,Those familiar with the work of Alshawi and Crouch Alshawi Crouch 1992 might have noticed the similarity of their interpretation mechanism and what we have achieved by our modifications to standard HPSG semantics.
E95-1002.txt,67,The elements of QUANTS play exactly the same role as the instantiated metavariables of Alshawi and Crouch.
E95-1002.txt,68,This means that we could adapt their interpretation mechahism to our partially scoped CONTENT structures.
E95-1002.txt,69,But note that we already have achieved more than they have as we are able to express the clause boundeness restriction for generalized quantifiers.
E95-1002.txt,70,We will not go into the details and show how the truth conditions of Alshawi and Crouch have to be modified in order to apply to partially scoped CONTENT structures.
E95-1002.txt,71,We will instead go ahead and work out the limitations of what we called the first strategy.
E95-1002.txt,72,To keep things as easy as possible we restrict ourselves to the case of simple sentences i.e. to. trivial tree structures of QSTORE and QUANTS values that consist of one single node only .
E95-1002.txt,73,In this case the QUANTS value as well as the instantiation of metavariables imposes a partial order on the relative scope of quantifiers.
E95-1002.txt,74,Assume we had a sentence with three quantifiers_comma_ Q1_comma_ Q2 and Q3.
E95-1002.txt,75,Then the possible lenghts of QUANTS values varies from 0 to 3.
E95-1002.txt,76,Lengths 0 and 1 leave the relative scope of Q1_comma_ Q2 and Q3 completely underspecified.
E95-1002.txt,77,Values of length 2 say that their first element always has wide scope over the second_comma_ leaving all possible choices for the third quantifier.
E95-1002.txt,78,And finally we have the fully specified scoping relations given by values of length 3.
E95-1002.txt,79,There are_comma_ however_comma_ some possibilities to restrict scope relationships that cannot be represented this way One cannot_comma_ for example_comma_ represent the ambiguity that remains if we or_comma_ syntax and semantics require that Q1 and Q2 must have scope over Q3_comma_ but leaves unspecified the relative scope between Q1 and Q2 nor are we able to express a restriction that says Q1 must have scope over both_comma_ Q2 and Q3_comma_ while leaving the relative scope between Q2 and Q3 unspecified.
E95-1002.txt,80,Retrieving a quantifier Qi or starting to calculate the truth value of a sentence by first considering this quantifier is an operation that takes Qi and adds it to QUANTS.
E95-1002.txt,81,As QUANTS is a list this amounts to a full specification of the relative scope of Qi with respect to all other elements already contained in QUANTS.
E95-1002.txt,82,This shows that the expressive power of the representation language is too restrictive already for simple sentences.
E95-1002.txt,83,We need to represent partial orders of quantifier scope.
E95-1002.txt,84,But we cannot do this by talking about a pair consisting of a quantifier Qi and a list of quantifiers QUANTS.
E95-1002.txt,86,This not only increases the expressive power of the representation language_comma_ it also allows for the formulation of restrictions on quantifier scope in a declarative and natural way.
E95-1002.txt,87,The formalism of UDRSs we introduce in the following section is particularly suited to talk about semantic information contributed by diffcrent components of a sentence.
E95-1002.txt,88,It therefore provides a particularly good ground to implement a principle based construction of semantic representations.
E95-1002.txt,89,3 UDRS Construction in HPSG In the following we will design a syntax semantics interface for the construction of UDRSes in HPSG_comma_ focussing on the underspecified representation of scope and plural.
E95-1002.txt,90,To overcome the problems discussed in Section 2 we chose to depart from the semantics used in standard HPSG Pollard Sag 1994 _comma_ and instead allow for the construction of U DRScs.
E95-1002.txt,91,The structure of the CONTENT attribute as well as the Semantics Principle will be changed substantially_comma_ since the construction of U DRSes allows for inherently different information structures and processing mechanisms.
E95-1002.txt,92,The former CONTENT attribute is replaced by a complex feature structure UDRS_comma_ consisting of three attributes_comma_ LS_comma_ SUBORD and CONDS.
E95-1002.txt,94,SUBORD contains information about the hierarchical structure of a DRS.
E95-1002.txt,95,It is expressed by means of a subordination relation_comma_ _comma_ between labels.
E95-1002.txt,97,The quantificational relation holding between them is stated in terms of the relation attribute_comma_ REL.
E95-1002.txt,98,In the lexical entry for every_comma_ given in 3 _comma_ a new discourse referent is introduced_comma_ in the restrictor DRS_comma_ labelled 111_comma_ which is identified with the label of the subcategorized NP.
E95-1002.txt,99,The feature SUBORD defines the labels of restrictor and scope to be subordinate to the label 11 which identifies the entire condition.
E95-1002.txt,101,Contrary to the Semantics Principle of Pollard Sag 1994 the semantic conditions are always inherited from both daughters we assume bi The reference to discourse referents of the syntactic arguments is only provisionally stated here. For the precise definition see 10 below.
E95-1002.txt,102,The use of SUBCAT SC as a head attribute is motivated in Frank 1994 . nary branching and therefore project to the uppermost sentential level.
E95-1002.txt,103,Furthermore_comma_ clause I applies to head comp and head adj structures in exactly the same way.
E95-1002.txt,104,7 Clause II of the Semantics Principle defines the inheritance of subordination restrictions The subordination restrictions of the phrase are defined by the union of the SUBORD values of the daughters.
E95-1002.txt,105,Clause Ill of the Semantics Principle states the distinguished labels LS of the phrase to be identical to the distinguished labels of the HEADdaughter.
E95-1002.txt,106,It is therefore guaranteed that in binary branching structures the minimal and maximal labels of the head category are available all along the extended head projection_comma_ s This prepares clauses IV and V of the Semantics Principle_comma_ which define the binding of discourse markers and locality of quantificational scope_comma_ respectively.
E95-1002.txt,107,We will first consider clause IV and will come back to clause V in the next Section.
E95-1002.txt,108,In a U DRS_comma_ the partial structure of the verb has to be weakly subordinate to the scope of all the partial DRSes that introduce the discourse markers corresponding to the verb s arguments.
E95-1002.txt,109,This guarantees that all occurrences of discourse markers are properly bound by some superordinated DRS.
E95-1002.txt,110,The constraint is realized by clause IV of the Semantics Principle_comma_ the Closed Formula Principle.
E95-1002.txt,111,It guarantees that the label associated with the verb_comma_ which is identified with the distinguished minimal label of the sentential projection_comma_ is subordinated to the minimal label_comma_ or lower bound of each of the verb s arguments.
E95-1002.txt,112,Note that with quantified arguments the predicate of the verb must be subordinate to the nuclear scope of the quantifier.
E95-1002.txt,113,As defined in 3 _comma_ it is in fact the nuclear scope of the quantified structure that will be accessed by the distinguished minimal label of the quantified NP.
E95-1002.txt,114,Thus the Closed Formula Principle IV in 5 states that in every non functional head comp struc a further subordination restriction is unioned to the phrase s SUBORD value_comma_ which subordinates the minimal label of the head here the minimal label associated with the verb to the minimal label of its actual complement_comma_ which in case of a quantified argument identifies the nuclear scope.
E95-1002.txt,117,SFunctional categories inherit the distinguished labels of their complement see 7 .
E95-1002.txt,118,The distinguished labels therefore project along the extended head projection.
E95-1002.txt,119,12 I Inheritance of UDRS Conditions II Inheritance of subordination restrictions l III Projection of the distinguished labels IV Closed Formula Principle Note that generalized quantifiers were marked as scope bearing by non identical values of minimal and maximal labels and singular indefinite NPs were marked as not scope bearing by identifying minimal and maximal labels.
E95-1002.txt,120,As plural NPs introduce a quantificational condition when they are interpreted distributively but behave like indefinites when interpreted collectively_comma_ in a representation of their meaning that is underspecified with respect to the distributive collective ambiguity plural NPs must be marked as potentially scope bearing.
E95-1002.txt,121,This can be achieved if in the lexicon entry of a plural determiner 6 we do not completely specify the relation between the minimal label 112 and the maximal label l _comma_ but only require that 112 is weakly subordinate to 11.
E95-1002.txt,122,This weak subordination relation will be further restricted to either identity or strict subordination when more information is available from the semantic or pragmatic context that allows the ambiguity to be resolved.
E95-1002.txt,123,By monotonically adding further constraints a collective or quantificational distributive or generic reading of the plural NP may then be specified_comma_ xl If a distributive reading is chosen_comma_ the minimal label 112 will identify the nuclear scope of the quantified structure_comma_ and in the case of a collective reading the relation of weak subordination between minimal and maximal label will be reduced to identity.
E95-1002.txt,124,We will state this in detail in Section 4.
E95-1002.txt,126,The subordination restrictions are projected from the lexicon or get introdhced monotonical9The Semantics Principle will only be given for headcomp structures.
E95-1002.txt,127,For head subj and head adj structures corresponding clauses have to be stated.
E95-1002.txt,128,For head fillerstructures we only define inheritance of CONDS_comma_ SUBORD_comma_ and LS from the HEAD DTR.
E95-1002.txt,129,lOThe dots indicate that further subordination restrictions will be unioned to the phrase s SUBORD value by clause V of the Semantics Principle_comma_ defined below.
E95-1002.txt,130,llXVe are not in the position to discuss the factors that determine these constraints here. ly_comma_ e.g. by the Closed Formula Principle to ensure the correct binding of discourse referents.
E95-1002.txt,131,Further subordination restrictions will be added monotonically by the remaining clauses of the Semantics Principle_comma_ to be introduced in the next Section.
E95-1002.txt,132,4 Quantifier Scope and Plural Disambiguation Quantificational Scope Since the conditions on quantificational scope for generalized quantifiers and distributive readings of plural NPs are dependent on syntactic structure_comma_ the Semantics Principle will be supplemented by further clauses governing the interface between syntactic constraints and semantic representation.
E95-1002.txt,133,Note that genuine quantifiers as well as distributive readings of plural NPs differ in their scope potential from indefinite NPs and collectivcly interpreted plural NPs.
E95-1002.txt,134,Whereas the latter may take arbitrarily wide scope_comma_ the scope of the former is clause bounded_comma_ i.e. they are allowed to take scope only over elements that appear in their local domain.
E95-1002.txt,135,We implement this restriction by requiring that the maximal label of a generalized quantifier be subordinate to the distinguished label that identifies the upper bound of the local domain.
E95-1002.txt,136,For plural NPs_comma_ a similar constraint must be stated in case a distributive reading is chosen which specifies the plural NP as scope bearing.
E95-1002.txt,137,The distinction between scope bearing and not scope bearing NPs was defined by strict subordination and identity of the distinguished labels_comma_ respectively.
E95-1002.txt,138,In case a distributive reading is chosen by the clauses for plural disambiguation_comma_ to be stated below_comma_ the relation of weak subordination in 6 _comma_ is strengthened to strict subordination.
E95-1002.txt,139,Yet_comma_ plural disambiguation may take place rather late in subsequent discourse_comma_ while the syntactic constraints for quantificational scope can only be determined locally.
E95-1002.txt,140,The Quantitier Scope Principle V will therefore introduce conditionalized subordination restrictions to define the clause boundedness of both generalized quantifiers and distributively quantified plural NPs.
E95-1002.txt,141,2 For finite sentences the local domain for quantified verb arguments comes down to the local IP projection Frey 1993 .
E95-1002.txt,142,In a functional HPSG grammar see Frank 1994 this local domain corresponds to the functional projection of the finite VP.
E95-1002.txt,143,The distinguished maximal label lmax which identifies the upper bound of the local domain for quantified vcrb arguments will therefore be instantiated by the complementizer heading a finite sentence_comma_ as in 7 .

E95-1002.txt,145,13 Due to the projection of the distinguished labels by clause III of the Semantics Principle and the definition of functional categories_comma_ the upper bound for the local domain of quantifier scope_comma_ lma _comma_ is available throughout the extended projection_comma_ where clause V of the Semantics Principle_comma_ the Quantifier Scope Principle_comma_ applies.

E95-1013.txt,1,movement grammars LMGs provide a general account of extraposition phenomena through an attribute mechanism allowing top down displacement of syntactical information. LMGs provide a simple and efficient treatment of complex linguistic phenomena such as cross serial dependencies in German and Dutch separating the treatment of natural language into a parsing phase closely resembling traditional contextfree treatment_comma_ and a disambiguation phase which can be carried out using matching_comma_ as opposed to full unification employed in most current grammar formalisms of linguistical relevance.

E95-1023.txt,2,A sound_comma_ complete and terminating deterministic constraint solving procedure is given.
E95-1023.txt,3,Deterministic computational model is achieved by weakening the logic such that it is sufficient for linguistic applications involving word order.

E95-1023.txt,5,Within HPSG Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1987 Pollard and Sag_comma_ 1994 the constituent ordering principle given in 1 is intended to express the relation between the value of the PHON attribute and the DTRS attribute which contains the hierarchical structure of the derivation.
E95-1023.txt,7,1.1 Reape s approach The idea taken in Reape s approach Reape_comma_ 1993 is to suggest that word order is enforced between locally definable word order domains which are ordered sequences of constituents.
E95-1023.txt,8,Word order domains in Reape s approach are totally ordered sequences.
E95-1023.txt,9,A domain union operation as given in 3 is then employed to construct word order domains locally within a HPSG derivation step.

E95-1023.txt,12,If A is the string a_comma_b and B is the string c_comma_d _comma_ their domain union C given by O A_comma_B_comma_C will produce all the sequences in which a precedes b and c precedes d i.e. the following sequences a_comma_b_comma_c_comma_d a_comma_c_comma_b_comma_d a_comma_c_comma_d_comma_b  c_comma_d_comma_a_comma_b  c_comma_d_comma_a_comma_b  c_comma_a_comma_b_comma_d However in this system to encode the property that x_comma_ y_comma_ z is a domain in which the ordering is arbitrary i.e. free then one needs the following disjunctive statements x_comma_y_comma_z U x_comma_z_comma_y H y_comma_x_comma_z U y_comma_z_comma_x H z_comma_x_comma_y U z_comma_y_comma_x It is simply not possible to be agnostic about the relative ordering of sequence elements within Reape s system.
E95-1023.txt,13,We identify two deficiencies in Reape s approach namely System is non deterministic generate and test paradigm Not possible to be agnostic about order This is so since domain union is a nondeterministic operation and secondly underspecification of ordering within elements of a domain is not permitted.
E95-1023.txt,14,In the following sections we describe a constraint language for specifying LP constraints that overcomes both these deficiencies.
E95-1023.txt,15,Additionally our constraint language provides a broad range of constraints for specifying linear precedence that go well beyond what is available within current typed feature formalisms.
E95-1023.txt,16,Our approach is in the spirit of Reape s approach but improves upon it.
E95-1023.txt,17,Furthermore_comma_ a sound_comma_ complete and terminating consistency checking procedure is described.
E95-1023.txt,18,165 Our constraint solving rules axe deterministic and incremental.
E95-1023.txt,19,Hence these do not introduce costly choice points.
E95-1023.txt,20,These constraint solving rules can be employed for building an efficient implementation.
E95-1023.txt,21,This is an important requirement for practical systems.
E95-1023.txt,22,Indeed we have successfully extended the ProFIT typed feature formalism Erbach_comma_ 1995 with the constructs described in this paper.
E95-1023.txt,23,2 Outline of an alternative approach To motivate our approach we start with an example on scrambling in German subordinate clauses.
E95-1023.txt,24,4 dab er einen Mann in der Strafle lanfen that he a man in the street walking sah. saw. that he saw a man walking in the street.
E95-1023.txt,25,5 dab er in der Strafle einen Mann laufen sah.
E95-1023.txt,26,6 daft einen Mann er in der Stral3e lanfen sah.
E95-1023.txt,30,The above data can be captured precisely if we can state that sah requires both its verbal argument laufen and its NP argument er to precede it.
E95-1023.txt,31,Similarly_comma_ laufen would require both its arguments einen Mann and in der Strafle to precede it.
E95-1023.txt,32,This is illustrated schematically in 10 below.
E95-1023.txt,33,10 er sah  einen mann_comma_ in der strasse laufen Our idea is to employ a specification such as the one given in 11 which is a partial specification of the lexical entry for the verb sah.
E95-1023.txt,34,The specification can be thought of as a formal specification of the intuitive description given in 12 .
E95-1023.txt,37,The condition part 167 G of a guarded constraint if G then S else T is known as a guard.
E95-1023.txt,38,The consequent S is executed if the current set of constraints entail the guard G.
E95-1023.txt,39,The consequent T is executed if the current set of constraints disentail the guard G.
E95-1023.txt,40,If the current set of constraints neither entail nor disentail G then the execution of the whole guarded constraint is blocked until more information is available.
E95-1023.txt,41,The application of guarded constraints within computational linguistics has not been well explored.
E95-1023.txt,42,However_comma_ the Horn extended feature structures described in Hegner_comma_ 1991 can be thought of as adding guards to feature structures.
E95-1023.txt,43,On the other hand_comma_ within logic programming guarded logic programming languages have a longer history originating with committed choice languages Ueda_comma_ 1985 and popularised by the concurrent constraint programming paradigm due to Saraswat Saraswat and Rinard_comma_ 1990 Saraswat_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1023.txt,44,For space reasons_comma_ we do not cover the logic of guarded feature constraints_comma_ guards on set membership constraints and guards o.n precedence constraints.
E95-1023.txt,45,Guarded feature constraints have been extensively studied in Ait Kaci et al._comma_ 1992 Smolka and Treinen_comma_ 1994 Ait Kaci and Podelski_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1023.txt,46,4 A feature logic with LP constraints In this section we provide formal definitions for the syntax and semantics of an extended feature logic that directly supports linear precedence constraints as logical primitives.
E95-1023.txt,47,The logic described in this paper is a further development of the one described in Manandhar_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1023.txt,48,The syntax of the constraint language is defined by the following BNF definitions.
E95-1023.txt,49,Syntax Let be the set of relation symbols and let 79 be the set of irreflexive relation symbols.
E95-1023.txt,51,The constraint x 3f y states that y is one of the f values of x.
E95-1023.txt,52,The constraint x 3p  y just says that x is related to y via the transitive closure of p.
E95-1023.txt,53,The precedence constraint such as Sign1 precedes Sign is intended to be captured by the constraint Sign1 3p Sign where p denotes the user chosen immediate precedence relation.
E95-1023.txt,54,Similarly_comma_ x 31o y states that x is related to y via the transitive_comma_ reflexive closure of p.
E95-1023.txt,55,This constraint is similar to the constraint x 3p  y except that it permits x and y to be equal.
E95-1023.txt,56,The constraints f x p g y and f x p g y are intended to enforce precedence between two word ordering domains.
E95-1023.txt,57,The constraint f x p g y states that every f value of x precedes i.e. is in the p relation with every g value of y.
E95-1023.txt,58,The constraint f x p g y is analogous.
E95-1023.txt,60,Since our language supports both feature constraints and set membership constraints the conventional semantics for feature logic Smolka_comma_ 1992 needs to be extended.
E95-1023.txt,61,The essential difference being that we interpret every feature relation as a binary relation on the domain of interpretation.
E95-1023.txt,62,Feature constraints then require that they behave functionally on the variable upon which the constraint is expressed.
E95-1023.txt,63,A precise semantics of our constraint language is given next.
E95-1023.txt,64,Semantics An interpretation structure 27  z_comma_ .I is a structure such that  is an arbitrary non empty set .i is an interpretation function which maps every relation f E to a binary relation I _c x U I every relation p E 79 to a binary relation pi C i X I with the added condition that pZ is irreflexive A variable assignment is a function c 12 J.
E95-1023.txt,68,4.1 Two Restrictions The logic we have described comes with 2 limitations which at first glance appears to be somewhat severe_comma_ namely NO atomic values NO precedence as a feature This is so because it turns out that adding both functionM precedence and atoms in general leads to a non deterministic constraint solving procedure.
E95-1023.txt,69,To illustrate this_comma_ consider the following constraints x f yAy aAx 3f z where a is assumed to be an atom.
E95-1023.txt,70,The above constraints state that y is the f value of x and y is the atom a and z is related to x by the reflexive transitive closure of f.
E95-1023.txt,71,Determining consistency of such constraints in general involves solving for the following disjunctive choices of constraints.
E95-1023.txt,73,Rule FeatEx169 TransConj x 3p yAx 3p yACs x 3p yACs TransClos x SR1 yAy 3R zAC8 X 3 R1 X R2 zA x 3RI yAy R2 zACs if x Sp z C A x 3 R R z C where R x R is computed from x p p p p p p p p Cycle x 3p y X f x R g y A x 3f xlA y  3g yl AC8 DomPrec xl 3R y A f x R g y A x 3f xl Ay 3g yl ACs ifx 3p yl C A x 3R y _ Cs where R ranges over p _comma_ p Figure 2 Constraint Solving II ists deals with the interaction of feature and set membership constraint.
E95-1023.txt,74,Rule Subset deals with subset constraints and adds a new constraint x 5f y in the presence of the subset constraint x f D g y and the constraint y G z where G ranges over g_comma_ 3g .
E95-1023.txt,75,The constraint solving rules given in figure 2 deal with constraints involving the precedes and the precedes or equal to relations and domain precedence.
E95-1023.txt,76,Rule TransConj eliminates the weaker constraint x 3p y when both x 2p y Ax 3p y hold.
E95-1023.txt,77,Rule TransClos effectively computes the transitive closure of the precedence relation one step at a time.
E95-1023.txt,78,Rule Cycle detects cyclic relations that are consistent_comma_ namely_comma_ when x precedes or equals y and vice versa then x y is asserted.
E95-1023.txt,79,Finally rule DomPrec propagates constraints involving domain precedence.
E95-1023.txt,80,We say that a set of constraints are in normal form if no constraint solving rules are applicable to it.
E95-1023.txt,81,We say that a set of constraints in normal form contains a clash if it contains constraints of the form x Bp x In the following sections we show that our constraint solving rules are sound and every clashfree constraint system in normal form is consistent.
E95-1023.txt,82,5.1 Soundness_comma_ Completeness and Termination Theorem 1 Soundness Let Z_comma_o be any interpretation_comma_ assignment pair and let Cs be any set of constraints.
E95-1023.txt,83,If a constraint solving rule transforms Cs to Crs then z_comma_a C_comma_ iffz_comma_ a C _comma_ Proof Sketch The soundness claim can be verified by checking that every rule indeed preserves the interpretation of every variable and every relation symbol.

E95-1023.txt,85,Proof Sketch For the first part_comma_ let Cs be a constraint system containing a clash then it is clear from the definition of clash that there is no interpretation E and variable assignment a which satisfies Cs.
E95-1023.txt,86,Let Cs be a clash free constraint system in normal form.
E95-1023.txt,87,We shall construct an interpretation 7  L n_comma_ .n and a variable assignment a such that TO_comma_ a Cs.
E95-1023.txt,88,Let L R Y.
E95-1023.txt,89,The assignment function a is defined as follows if x does not occur in Cs then a x x if x is such that x occurs exactly once in x y 6 C then a x x if x y 6 Cs then a y a x Note that for constraints in normal form if x y 6 C8 then either x is identical to y or x occurs just once in C in the constraint x y .
E95-1023.txt,90,Otherwise Rule Equals is applicable.
E95-1023.txt,91,The interpretation function .R is defined as follows fa x x  succ a x _comma_ f p x  succ x _comma_p It can be shown by a case by case analysis that for every constraint K in C_comma_ _comma_a K.
E95-1023.txt,92,Hence we have the theorem.
E95-1023.txt,93,170 Initial Description Figure 3 Linearisation of precedence ordered DAGs Theorem 3 Termination The consistency checking procedure terminates in a finite number of steps.
E95-1023.txt,94,Proof Sketch The termination claim can be easily verified if we first exclude rules Subset _comma_ TransClos and DomPrec from consideration.
E95-1023.txt,95,Then for the remainder of the rules termination is obvious since these rules only simplify existing constraints.
E95-1023.txt,96,For these rules 1.
E95-1023.txt,97,Rule Subset increases the size of succ x_comma_ f but since none of our rules introduces new variables this is terminating.
E95-1023.txt,99,Rules TransClos and DomPrec asserts a relation R between pairs of variables x_comma_ y.
E95-1023.txt,100,However_comma_ none of these rules apply once x 3p  y is known.
E95-1023.txt,101,Furthermore_comma_ if x 3p  y is known it is never simplified to the weaker x 3p y.
E95-1023.txt,102,This means that these rules converge.
E95-1023.txt,103,6 Linearisation of precedence ordered DAGs The models generated by the completeness theorem interpret the map of every precedence relation p as a directed acyclic graph DAG as depicted in figure 3.
E95-1023.txt,104,However sentences in natural languages are always totally ordered i.e. they are strings of words .
E95-1023.txt,105,This then raises the question Is it possible to generate linearised models
E95-1023.txt,106,For the logic that we have described this is always possible.
E95-1023.txt,107,We only provide a graphical argument given in figure 3 to illustrate that this is indeed possible.
E95-1023.txt,108,The question that arises is then What happens when we add immediate precedence
E95-1023.txt,109,I A I B o I o I Inco ect Model Model IA CIB DI Correct Model Figure 4 Difficulty in guaranteeing linearisable models with immediate precedence 6.1 Problem with immediate precedence However if we add immediate precedence to our logic then it is not clear whether we can guarantee linearisable models.
E95-1023.txt,110,This is highlighted in figure 4.
E95-1023.txt,111,As illustrated in this figure consistency checking of constraints involving both linear precedence and immediate precedence with a semantics that requires linearised models is not trivial.
E95-1023.txt,112,So we do not explore this scenario in this paper.
E95-1023.txt,113,However_comma_ it is possible to add immediate precedence and extend the constraint solving rules described in this paper in such a way that it is sound and complete with respect to the current semantics described in this paper which does not insist on linearised models .
E95-1023.txt,114,7 Handling immediate precedence In this section_comma_ we provide additional constraint solving rules for handling immediate precedence.
E95-1023.txt,115,The basic idea is to treat immediate precedence as a functional relation whose inverse too is functional.
E95-1023.txt,116,In effect what we add to our logic is both precedence as a feature and a new constraint for representing the inverse functional precedence.
E95-1023.txt,117,This is summarised by Represent x immediately precedes y by x p yAy p 1 x Semantics Z_comma_ a y p 1 x  1 y  x The additional rules given in figure below are all that is needed to handle immediate precedence.

E95-1023.txt,120,Although_comma_ theoretically speaking_comma_ our logic comes with some restrictions these have no practical consequences whatsoever.
E95-1023.txt,121,Our implementation of the logic as an extension to the ProFIT typed feature formalism shows that a reasonably efficient implementation is feasible.
E95-1023.txt,122,Some further work is necessary to determine the computational complexity of our constraint solving procedure.
E95-1023.txt,123,However_comma_ we believe that it is polynomial.
E95-1023.txt,124,The logic presented in this paper generalises the approach taken in Reape_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1023.txt,125,Our approach demonstrates that it is not necessary to employ a non deterministic operation such as domain union to manipulate domains.
E95-1023.txt,126,Instead precedence constraints are directly embedded in feature logic and a deterministic constraint solving procedure is provided.
E95-1023.txt,127,A wide range of constraints involving precedence is provided directly in feature logic ranging from constraints expressing precedence between variables_comma_ precedence between domains to guards on precedence constraints.

E95-1020.txt,1,paper presents an algorithm for tagging words whose part of speech properties are unknown. Unlike previous work_comma_ the algorithm categorizes word tokens in con ezt instead of word ypes.
E95-1020.txt,2,The algorithm is evaluated on the Brown Corpus.
E95-1020.txt,4,Since online text becomes available in ever increasing volumes and an ever increasing number of languages_comma_ there is a growing need for robust processing techniques that can analyze text without expensive and time consuming adaptation to new domains and genres.
E95-1020.txt,5,This need motivates research on fully automatic text processing that may rely on general principles of linguistics and computation_comma_ but does not depend on knowledge about individual words.
E95-1020.txt,6,In this paper_comma_ we describe an experiment on fully automatic derivation of the knowledge necessary for part of speech tagging.
E95-1020.txt,7,Part of speech tagging is of interest for a number of applications_comma_ for example access to text data bases Kupiec_comma_ 1993 _comma_ robust parsing Abney_comma_ 1991 _comma_ and general parsing deMarcken_comma_ 1990 Charniak et al._comma_ 1994 .
E95-1020.txt,8,The goal is to find an unsupervised method for tagging that relies on general distributional properties of text_comma_ properties that are invariant across languages and sublanguages.
E95-1020.txt,9,While the proposed algorithm is not successful for all grammatical categories_comma_ it does show that fully automatic tagging is possible when demands on accuracy are modest.
E95-1020.txt,10,The following sections discuss related work_comma_ describe the learning procedure and evaluate it on the Brown Corpus Francis and Ku era_comma_ 1982 .
E95-1020.txt,11,2 Related Work The simplest part of speech taggers are bigram or trigram models Church_comma_ 1989 Charniak et al._comma_ 1993 .
E95-1020.txt,12,They require a relatively large tagged training text.
E95-1020.txt,13,Transformation based tagging as introduced by Brill 1993 also requires a handtagged text for training.
E95-1020.txt,14,No pretagged text is necessary for Hidden Markov Models Jelinek_comma_ 1985 Cutting et al._comma_ 1991 Kupiec_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1020.txt,15,Still_comma_ a lexicon is needed that specifies the possible parts of speech for every word.
E95-1020.txt,16,Brill and Marcus 1992a have shown that the effort necessary to construct the part of speech lexicon can be considerably reduced by combining learning procedures and a partial part of speech categorization elicited from an informant.
E95-1020.txt,17,The present paper is concerned with tagging languages and sublanguages for which no a priori knowledge about grammatical categories is available_comma_ a situation that occurs often in practice Brill and Marcus_comma_ 1992a .
E95-1020.txt,18,Several researchers have worked on learning grammatical properties of words.
E95-1020.txt,19,Elman 1990 trains a connectionist net to predict words_comma_ a process that generates internal representations that reflect grammatical category.
E95-1020.txt,20,Brill et al. 1990 try to infer grammatical category from bigram statistics.
E95-1020.txt,21,Finch and Chater 1992 and Finch 1993 use vector models in which words are clustered according to the similarity of their close neighbors in a corpus.
E95-1020.txt,22,Kneser and Ney 1993 present a probabilistic model for entropy maximization that also relies on the immediate neighbors of words in a corpus.
E95-1020.txt,23,Biber 1993 applies factor analysis to collocations of two target words certain and right with their immediate neighbors.
E95-1020.txt,24,What these approaches have in common is that they classify words instead of individual occurrences.
E95-1020.txt,25,Given the widespread part of speech ambiguity of words this is problematicJ How should a word like plant be categorized if it has uses both as a verb and as a noun
E95-1020.txt,26,How can a categorization be considered meaningful if the infinitive marker to is not distinguished from the homophonous preposition
E95-1020.txt,27,In a previous paper Schfitze_comma_ 1993 _comma_ we trained a neural network to disambiguate part of speech Although Biber 1993 classifies collocations_comma_ these can also be ambiguous.
E95-1020.txt,28,For example_comma_ for certain has both senses of certain particular and sure .
E95-1020.txt,29,141 word side nearest neighbors onto left onto right seemed left seemed right into toward away off together against beside around down reduce among regarding against towards plus toward using unlike appeared might would remained had became could must should seem seems wanted want going meant tried expect likely Table h Words with most similar left and right neighbors for onto and seemed . using context however_comma_ no information about the word that is to be categorized was used.
E95-1020.txt,30,This scheme fails for cases like The soldiers rarely come home. vs. The soldiers will come home. where the context is identical and information about the lexical item in question rarely vs. will is needed in combination with context for correct classification.
E95-1020.txt,31,In this paper_comma_ we will compare two tagging algorithms_comma_ one based on classifying word types_comma_ and one based on classifying words plus context.
E95-1020.txt,32,3 Tag induction We start by constructing representations of the syntactic behavior of a word with respect to its left and right context.
E95-1020.txt,33,Our working hypothesis is that syntactic behavior is reflected in cooccurrence patterns.
E95-1020.txt,34,Therefore_comma_ we will measure the similarity between two words with respect to their syntactic behavior to_comma_ say_comma_ their left side by the degree to which they share the same neighbors on the left.
E95-1020.txt,35,If the counts of neighbors are assembled into a vector with one dimension for each neighbor _comma_ the cosine can be employed to measure similarity.
E95-1020.txt,36,It will assign a value close to 1.0 if two words share many neighbors_comma_ and 0.0 if they share none.
E95-1020.txt,37,We refer to the vector of left neighbors of a word as its left contezt vector_comma_ and to the vector of right neighbors as its right contezt vector.
E95-1020.txt,38,The unreduced context vectors in the experiment described here have 250 entries_comma_ corresponding to the 250 most frequent words in the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,39,This basic idea of measuring distributional similarity in terms of shared neighbors must be modified because of the sparseness of the data.
E95-1020.txt,40,Consider two infrequent adjectives that happen to modify different nouns in the corpus.
E95-1020.txt,41,Their right similarity according to the cosine measure would be zero.
E95-1020.txt,42,This is clearly undesirable.
E95-1020.txt,43,But even with high frequency words_comma_ the simple vector model can yield misleading similarity measurements.
E95-1020.txt,44,A case in point is a vs. an .
E95-1020.txt,45,These two articles do not share any right neighbors since the former is only used before consonants and the latter only before vowels.
E95-1020.txt,46,Yet intuitively_comma_ they are similar with respect to their right syntactic context despite the lack of common right neighbors.
E95-1020.txt,47,Our solution to these problems is the application of a singular value decomposition.
E95-1020.txt,48,We can represent the left vectors of all words in the corpus as a matrix C with n rows_comma_ one for each word whose left neighbors are to be represented_comma_ and k columns_comma_ one for each of the possible neighbors.
E95-1020.txt,49,SVD can be used to approximate the row and column vectors of C in a low dimensional space.
E95-1020.txt,50,In more detail_comma_ SVD decomposes a matrix C_comma_ the matrix of left vectors in our case_comma_ into three matrices To_comma_ So_comma_ and Do such that C ToSoD o So is a diagonal k by k matrix that contains the singular values of C in descending order.
E95-1020.txt,51,The ith singular value can be interpreted as indicating the strength of the ith principal component of C.
E95-1020.txt,52,To and Do are orthonormal matrices that approximate the rows and columns of C_comma_ respectively.
E95-1020.txt,53,By restricting the matrices To_comma_ So_comma_ and Do to their first m k columns principal components one obtains the matrices T_comma_ S_comma_ and D.
E95-1020.txt,54,Their product C is the best least square approximation of C by a matrix of rank m C TSD .
E95-1020.txt,55,We chose m 50 reduction to a 50 dimensional space for the SVD s described in this paper.
E95-1020.txt,56,SVD addresses the problems of generalization and sparseness because broad and stable generalizations are represented on dimensions with large values which will be retained in the dimensionality reduction.
E95-1020.txt,57,In contrast_comma_ dimensions corresponding to small singular values represent idiosyncrasies_comma_ like the phonological constraint on the usage of an vs. a _comma_ and will be dropped.
E95-1020.txt,58,We also gain efficiency since we can manipulate smaller vectors_comma_ reduced to 50 dimensions.
E95-1020.txt,59,We used SVDPACK to compute the singular value decompositions described in this paper Berry_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1020.txt,60,Table 1 shows the nearest neighbors of two words ordered according to closeness to the head word after the dimensionality reduction.
E95-1020.txt,61,Neighbors with highest similarity according to both left and right context are listed.
E95-1020.txt,62,One can see clear differences between the nearest neighbors in the two spaces.
E95-1020.txt,63,The right context neighbors of onto contain verbs because both prepositions and verbs govern noun phrases to their right.
E95-1020.txt,64,The left context neighborhood of onto reflects the fact that prepositional phrases are used in the same position as adverbs like away and together _comma_ thus making their left context similar.
E95-1020.txt,65,For seemed _comma_ left context neighbors are words that have similar types of noun phrases in subject position mainly auxiliaries .
E95-1020.txt,66,The rightcontext neighbors all take to infinitives as complements.
E95-1020.txt,67,An adjective like likely is very sim142 ilar to seemed in this respect although its left context is quite different from that of seemed .
E95-1020.txt,68,Similarly_comma_ the generalization that prepositions and transitive verbs are very similar if not identical in the way they govern noun phrases would be lost if left and right properties of words were lumped together in one representation.
E95-1020.txt,69,These examples demonstrate the importance of representing generalizations about left and right context separately.
E95-1020.txt,70,The left and right context vectors are the basis for four different tag induction experiments_comma_ which are described in detail below induction based on word type only induction based on word type and context induction based on word type and context_comma_ restricted to natural contexts induction based on word type and context_comma_ using generalized left and right context vectors 3.1 Induction based on word type only The two context vectors of a word characterize the distribution of neighboring words to its left an.d right.
E95-1020.txt,71,The concatenation of left and right context vector can therefore serve as a representation of a word s distributional behavior Finch and Chater_comma_ 1992 Sch itze_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1020.txt,72,We formed such concatenated vectors for all 47_comma_025 words surface forms in the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,73,Here_comma_ we use the raw 250dimensional context vectors and apply the SVD to the 47_comma_025 by 500 matrix 47_comma_025 words with two 250 dimensional context vectors each .
E95-1020.txt,74,We obtained 47_comma_025 50 dimensional reduced vectors from the SVD and clustered them into 200 classes using the fast clustering algorithm Buckshot Cutting et al._comma_ 1992 group average agglomeration applied to a sample .
E95-1020.txt,75,This classification constitutes the baseline performance for distributional partof speech tagging.
E95-1020.txt,76,All occurrences of a word are assigned to one class.
E95-1020.txt,77,As pointed out above_comma_ such a procedure is problematic for ambiguous words.
E95-1020.txt,78,3.2 Induction based on word type and context In order to exploit contextual information in the classification of a token_comma_ we simply use context vectors of the two words occurring next to the token.
E95-1020.txt,79,An occurrence of word w is represented by a concatenation of four context vectors The right context vector of the preceding word. The left context vector of w. The right context vector of w. The left context vector of the following word.
E95-1020.txt,80,The motivation is that a word s syntactic role depends both on the syntactic properties of its neighbors and on its own potential for entering into syntactic relationships with these neighbors.
E95-1020.txt,81,The only properties of context that we consider are the right context vector of the preceding word and the left context vector of the following word because they seem to represent the contextual information most important for the categorization of w.
E95-1020.txt,82,For example_comma_ for the disambiguation of work in her work seemed to be important _comma_ only the fact that seemed expects noun phrases to its left is important_comma_ the right context vector of seemed does not contribute to disambiguation.
E95-1020.txt,83,That only the immediate neighbors are crucial for categorization is clearly a simplification_comma_ but as the results presented below show it seems to work surprisingly well.
E95-1020.txt,84,Again_comma_ an SVD is applied to address the problems of sparseness and generalization.
E95-1020.txt,85,We randomly selected 20_comma_000 word triplets from the corpus and formed concatenations of four context vectors as described above.
E95-1020.txt,86,The singular value decomposition of the resulting 20_comma_000 by l_comma_000 matrix defines a mapping from the 1_comma_000 dimensional space of concatenated context vectors to a 50dimensional reduced space.
E95-1020.txt,87,Our tag set was then induced by clustering the reduced vectors of the 20_comma_000 selected occurrences into 200 classes.
E95-1020.txt,88,Each of the 200 tags is defined by the centroid of the corresponding class the sum of its members .
E95-1020.txt,89,Distributional tagging of an occurrence of a word w proceeds then by retrieving the four relevant context vectors right context vector of previous word_comma_ left context vector of following word_comma_ both context vectors of w concatenating them to one 1000 component vector_comma_ mapping this vector to 50 dimensions_comma_ computing the correlations with the 200 cluster centroids and_comma_ finally_comma_ assigning the occurrence to the closest cluster.
E95-1020.txt,90,This procedure was applied to all tokens of the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,91,We will see below that this method of distributional tagging_comma_ although partially successful_comma_ fails for many tokens whose neighbors are punctuation marks.
E95-1020.txt,92,The context vectors of punctuation marks contribute little information about syntactic categorization since there are no grammatical dependencies between words and punctuation marks_comma_ in contrast to strong dependencies between neighboring words.
E95-1020.txt,93,For this reason_comma_ a second induction on the basis of word type and context was performed_comma_ but only for those tokens with informative contexts.
E95-1020.txt,94,Tokens next to punctuation marks and tokens with rare words as neighbors were not included.
E95-1020.txt,95,Contexts with rare words less than ten occurrences were also excluded for similar reasons If a word only occurs nine or fewer times its left and right context vectors capture little information for syntactic categorization.
E95-1020.txt,96,In the experiment_comma_ 20_comma_000 natural contexts were randomly selected_comma_ processed by the SVD and clustered into 143 tag ADN CC CD DT IN ING MD N description adnominal modifier conjunction cardinal determiner preposition ing forms modal nominal Table 2 Evaluation tag Penn Treebank tags ADN CC CD DT PDT PRP IN VBG MD NNP S NN S tag POS PRP RB TO VB VBD VBN WDT description Penn Treebank tags possessive marker POS pronoun PRP adverbial RB RP RBR RBS infinitive marker TO infinitive VB inflected verb form VBD VBZ VBP predicative VBN PRD wh word WP WRB WDT set.
E95-1020.txt,97,Structural tags derived from parse trees are marked with ..
E95-1020.txt,99,The classification was then applied to all natural contexts of the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,100,3.3 Generalized context vectors The context vectors used so far only capture information about distributional interactions with the 250 most frequent words.
E95-1020.txt,101,Intuitively_comma_ it should be possible to gain accuracy in tag induction by using information from more words.
E95-1020.txt,102,One way to do this is to let the right context vector record which classes of left conte t vectors occur to the right of a word.
E95-1020.txt,103,The rationale is that words with similar left context characterize words to their right in a similar way.
E95-1020.txt,104,For example_comma_ seemed and would have similar left contexts_comma_ and they characterize the right contexts of he and the firefighter as potentially containing an inflected verb form.
E95-1020.txt,105,Rather than having separate entries in its right context vector for seemed _comma_ would _comma_ and likes _comma_ a word like he can now be characterized by a generalized entry for inflected verb form occurs frequently to my right .
E95-1020.txt,106,This proposal was implemented by applying a singular value decomposition to the 47025 by 250 matrix of left context vectors and clustering the resulting context vectors into 250 classes.
E95-1020.txt,107,A generalized right context vector v for word w was then formed by counting how often words from these 250 classes occurred to the right of w.
E95-1020.txt,108,Entry vi counts the number of times that a word from class i occurs to the right of w in the corpus as opposed to the number of times that the word with frequency rank i occurs to the right of w .
E95-1020.txt,109,Generalized left context vectors were derived by an analogous procedure using word based right context vectors.
E95-1020.txt,110,Note that the information about left and right is kept separate in this computation.
E95-1020.txt,111,This differs from previous approaches Finch and Chater_comma_ 1992 Schfitze_comma_ 1993 in which left and right context vectors of a word are always used in one concatenated vector.
E95-1020.txt,112,There are arguably fewer different types of right syntactic contexts than types of syntactic categories.
E95-1020.txt,113,For example_comma_ transitive verbs and prepositions belong to different syntactic categories_comma_ but their right contexts are virtually identical in that they require a noun phrase.
E95-1020.txt,114,This generalization could not be exploited if left and right context were not treated separately.
E95-1020.txt,115,Another argument for the two step derivation is that many words don t have any of the 250 most frequent words as their left or right neighbor.
E95-1020.txt,116,Hence_comma_ their vector would be zero in the wordbased scheme.
E95-1020.txt,117,The class based scheme makes it more likely that meaningful representations are formed for all words in the vocabulary.
E95-1020.txt,118,The generalized context vectors were input to the tag induction procedure described above for word based context vectors 20_comma_000 word triplets were selected from the corpus_comma_ encoded as 1_comma_000dimensional vectors consisting of four generalized context vectors _comma_ decomposed by a singular value decomposition and clustered into 200 classes.
E95-1020.txt,119,The resulting classification was applied to all tokens in the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,120,4 Results The results of the four experiments were evaluated by forming 16 classes of tags from the Penn Treebank as shown in Table 2.
E95-1020.txt,121,Preliminary experiments showed that distributional methods distinguish adnominal and predicative uses of adjectives e.g. the black cat vs. the cat is black .
E95-1020.txt,122,Therefore the tag ADN was introduced for uses of adjectives_comma_ nouns_comma_ and participles as adnominal modifiers.
E95-1020.txt,123,The tag PRD stands for predicative uses of adjectives.
E95-1020.txt,124,The Penn Treebank parses of the Brown corpus were used to determine whether a token functions as an adnominal modifier.
E95-1020.txt,125,Punctuation marks_comma_ special symbols_comma_ interjections_comma_ foreign words and tags with fewer than 100 instances were excluded from the evaluation.
E95-1020.txt,126,Tables 3 and 4 present results for word typebased induction and induction based on word type and context.
E95-1020.txt,127,For each tag t_comma_ the table lists the frequency of t in the corpus frequency 2_comma_ the number of induced tags i0_comma_ il_comma_ ._comma_ iz_comma_ that were assigned to it  classes the number of times an occurrence of t was correctly labeled as belonging to one of i0_comma_ Q_comma_..._comma_iz correct the number of times that a token of a different tag t was 2The small difference in overall frequency in the tables is due to the fact that some word based context vectors consist entirely of zeros.
E95-1020.txt,128,There were about a hundred word triplets whose four context vectors did not have non zero entries and could not be assigned a cluster.
E95-1020.txt,130,F 0.83 0.93 0.38 0.95 0.94 0.25 0.94 0.89 0.91 0.90 0.66 0.99 0.88 0.88 0.74 0.58 0.79 146 finitives were classified as adverbs since this is too rare a phenomenon to provide strong distributional evidence we do not DARE speak of _comma_ legislation could HELP remove .
E95-1020.txt,131,The case of the tags VBN and PRD past participles and predicative adjectives demonstrates the difficulties of word classes with indistinguishable distributions.
E95-1020.txt,132,There are hardly any distributional clues for distinguishing VBN and PRD since both are mainly used as complements of to be .s A common tag class was created for VBN and PRD to show that they are reasonably well distinguished from other parts of speech_comma_ even if not from each other.
E95-1020.txt,133,Semantic understanding is necessary to distinguish between the states described by phrases of the form to be adjective and the processes described by phrases of the form to be past participle .
E95-1020.txt,134,Finally_comma_ the method fails if there are no local dependencies that could be used for categorization and only non local dependencies are informative.
E95-1020.txt,135,For example_comma_ the adverb in Mc N.
E95-1020.txt,136,Hester_comma_ CURRENTLY Dean of... and the conjunction in to add that_comma_ IF United States policies ... have similar immediate neighbors comma_comma_ NP .
E95-1020.txt,137,The decision to consider only immediate neighbors is responsible for this type of error since taking a wider context into account would disambiguate the parts of speech in question.
E95-1020.txt,138,5 Future Work There are three avenues of future research we are interested in pursuing.
E95-1020.txt,139,First_comma_ we are planning to apply the algorithm to an as yet untagged language.
E95-1020.txt,140,Languages with a rich morphology may be more difficult than English since with fewer tokens per type_comma_ there is less data on which to base a categorization decision.
E95-1020.txt,141,Secondly_comma_ the error analysis suggests that considering non local dependencies would improve results.
E95-1020.txt,142,Categories that can be induced well those characterized by local dependencies could be input into procedures that learn phrase structure e.g. Brill and Marcus_comma_ 19925 Finch_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1020.txt,143,These phrase constraints could then be incorporated into the distributional tagger to characterize non local dependencies.
E95-1020.txt,144,Finally_comma_ our procedure induces a hard part ofspeech classification of occurrences in context_comma_ i.e._comma_ each occurrence is assigned to only one category.
E95-1020.txt,145,It is by no means generally accepted that such a classification is linguistically adequate.
E95-1020.txt,146,There is both synchronic Ross_comma_ 1972 and diachronic Tabor_comma_ 1994 evidence suggesting that words and their uses can inherit properties from several prototypical syntactic categories.
E95-1020.txt,147,For example_comma_ fun SBecause of phrases like I had sweet potatoes _comma_ forms of have cannot serve as a reliable discriminator either. in It s a fun thing to do. has properties of both a noun and an adjective superlative funnest possible .
E95-1020.txt,148,We are planning to explore soft classification algorithms that can account for these phenomena.
E95-1020.txt,149,6 Conclusion In this paper_comma_ we have attempted to construct an algorithm for fully automatic distributional tagging_comma_ using unannotated corpora as the sole source of information.
E95-1020.txt,150,The main innovation is that the algorithm is able to deal with part of speech ambiguity_comma_ a pervasive phenomenon in natural language that was unaccounted for in previous work on learning categories from corpora.
E95-1020.txt,151,The method was systematically evaluated on the Brown corpus.
E95-1020.txt,152,Even if no automatic procedure can rival the accuracy of human tagging_comma_ we hope that the algorithm will facilitate the initial tagging of texts in new languages and sublanguages.
E95-1020.txt,153,7 Acknowledgments I am grateful for helpful comments to Steve Finch_comma_ Jan Pedersen and two anonymous reviewers from ACL and EACL .
E95-1020.txt,154,I m also indebted to Michael Berry for SVDPACK and to the Penn Treebank Project for the parsed Brown corpus. .
E95-1038.txt,1,paper presents a grammar formalism designed for use in data oriented approaches to language processing. It goes on to investigate ways in which a corpus pre parsed with this formalism may be processed to provide a probabilistic language model for use in the parsing of fresh texts. .
E95-1038.txt,2,Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in probabilistic techniques for automatic language analysis.
E95-1038.txt,3,In particular_comma_ there has arisen a distinct paradigm of processing on the basis of preanalyzed data which has taken the name DataOriented Parsing.
E95-1038.txt,4,Data Oriented Parsing DOP is a model where no .
E95-1029.txt,1,it possible to specify a grammatical representation descriptors and their application guidelines to such a degree that it can be consistently applied by different grammarians e.g. for producing a benchmark corpus for p.arser evaluation Arguments for and against have been given_comma_ but very little empirical evidence.
E95-1029.txt,2,In this article we report on a double blind experiment with a surfaceoriented morphosyntactic grammatical representation used in a large scale English parser.
E95-1029.txt,3,We argue that a consistently applicable representation for morphology and also shallow syntax can be specified.
E95-1029.txt,4,A grammatical representation with a near 100 coverage of running text can be specified with a reasonable effort_comma_ especially if the representation is based on structural distinctions i.e. it is structurally resolvable .
E95-1029.txt,6,The central task of a parser is to assign grammatical descriptions onto input sentences.
E95-1029.txt,7,Evaluating a parser s output as well as designing a computational lexicon and grammar presupposes a predefined_comma_ parser independent specification of the grammatical representation.
E95-1029.txt,8,Perhaps surprisingly_comma_ the possibility of specifying a workable grammatical representation is a matter of controversy_comma_ even at lower levels of analysis_comma_ e.g. morphology incl. parts of speech .
E95-1029.txt,9,Consider the following setting the double blind experiment .
E95-1029.txt,10,Two linguists trained to apply a tag set to running text according to application guidelines a style sheet are to analyse a given data individually.
E95-1029.txt,11,The results are then automatically compared_comma_ and the differences are jointly examined by these linguists to see whether the differences are due to inattention_comma_ or whether they are intentional i.e. there is a genuine difference in analysis . How many percentage points of all words in running text are retain a different analysis after the differences due to inattention have been omitted
E95-1029.txt,12,The higher this percentage_comma_ the more susceptible seems the possibility of specifying a workable grammatical representation.
E95-1029.txt,13,According to a pessimistic view e.g. Church 1992 _comma_ the part of speech of several percentage points of words in running text is impossible to agree on by different judges_comma_ even after negotiations.
E95-1029.txt,14,A more optimistic view can be found in Leech and Eyes 1993_comma_ p. 39 Marcus et al. 1993_comma_ p. 328 they argue that a near 100 interjudge agreement is possible_comma_ provided the part of speech annotation is done carefully by experts.
E95-1029.txt,15,Unfortunately_comma_ they give very little empirical evidence for their position e.g. in terms of double blind experiments.
E95-1029.txt,16,Supposing defining these lower levels of grammatical representation is so problematic_comma_ the more distinctive levels should be even more difficult.
E95-1029.txt,17,If specifying the task of the parser what the parser is supposed to do turns out to be so problematic_comma_ one could even question the rationality of natural language parser design as a whole.
E95-1029.txt,18,In other words_comma_ the controversy regarding the specifiability of a grammatical representation is a fundamental issue.
E95-1029.txt,19,In this article we report on a double blind experiment with a surface oriented morphosyntactic grammatical representation used by a large scale English parser.
E95-1029.txt,20,We show that defining a grammatical representation is possible_comma_ even relatively straightforward.
E95-1029.txt,21,We present results from part ofspeech annotation and shallow syntactic analysis.
E95-1029.txt,22,Our three main findings are 1.
E95-1029.txt,23,A practically 100 interjudge agreement can be reached at the level of morphological incl. part of speech analysis provided that i the grammatical representation is based on structural distinctions and ii the individual descriptive practices of the most frequent problem cases are properly documented.
E95-1029.txt,25,A shallow dependency oriented functional syntax can be defined_comma_ very much like a morphological representation.
E95-1029.txt,26,The only substan210 tial difference seems to be that somewhat more effort for documenting the individual solution is needed at the level of syntax.
E95-1029.txt,28,A grammatical representation morphosyntactic descriptors and their application guidelines can be specified with a reasonable effort.
E95-1029.txt,29,In addition to general descriptive principles_comma_ only a few dozen construction specific entries seem necessary for reaching a high coverage of running text.
E95-1029.txt,30,In short In this paper we give empirical evidence for the possibility of specifying a grammatical representation in enough detail to make it almost consistently applicable.
E95-1029.txt,31,What we are less specific about here is the exact formal properties that make a representation easy to specify this topic remains open for future investigation.
E95-1029.txt,32,2 Grammatical representation in English Constraint Grammar In the experiment to be reported in Section 3_comma_ we employed the grammatical representation that defines the descriptive task of the English Constraint Grammar Parser ENGCG Karlsson et al. eds. 1995 .
E95-1029.txt,33,1 2.1 Morphology The morpholexical component in ENGCG employs 139 morphological tags for part of speech_comma_ inflection_comma_ derivation and certain syntactic properties e.g. verb classification .
E95-1029.txt,34,Each morphological analysis usually consists of several tags_comma_ and many words get several analyses as alternatives.

E95-1029.txt,37,To compare the ENGCG morphological description with another well known tag set_comma_ the Brown Corpus tag set ENGCG is more distinctive in that the part of speech distinction is spelled out in the description of determiner pronoun_comma_ preposition conjunction_comma_ and determiner adverb pronoun homographs_comma_ as well as uninflected verb forms_comma_ which are represented as ambiguous due to the subjunctive_comma_ imperative_comma_ infinitive and present tense readings.
E95-1029.txt,38,On the other hand_comma_ ENGCG does not spell out partof speech ambiguity in the description of ing and nonfinite ed forms_comma_ noun adjective homographs when the core meanings of the adjective and noun readings are similar_comma_ nor abbreviations vs. proper vs. common nouns.

E95-1003.txt,1,paper qualifies what a true termrecognition systems would have to recognize. The exact bracketing of the maximal termform is then proposed as an achieveable goal upon which current system performance should be measured.
E95-1003.txt,2,How recall and precision metrics are best adapted for measuring term recognition is suggested.
E95-1003.txt,4,In recent years_comma_ the automatic extraction of terms from running text has become a subject of growing interest.
E95-1003.txt,5,Practical applications such as dictionary_comma_ lexicon and thesaurus construction and maintenance_comma_ automatic indexing and machine translation have fuelled this interest.
E95-1003.txt,6,Given that concerns in automatic term recognition are practical_comma_ rather than theoretical_comma_ the lack of serious performance measurements in the published literature is surprising.
E95-1003.txt,7,Accounts of term recognition systems sometimes consist of a purely descriptive statement of the advantages of a particular approach and make no attempt to measure the pay off the proposed approach yields David_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1003.txt,8,Others produce partial figures without any clear statement of how they are derived Otman_comma_ 1991 .
E95-1003.txt,9,One of the best efforts to quantify the performance of a term recognition system Smadja_comma_ 1993 does so only for one processing stage_comma_ leaving unassessed the text to output performance of the system.
E95-1003.txt,10,While most automatic term recognition systems developed to date have been experimental or inhouse ones_comma_ a few systems like TermCruncher Normand_comma_ 1993 are now being marketed.
E95-1003.txt,11,Both the developers and users of such systems would benefit greatly by clearly qualifying what each system aims to achieve_comma_ and precisely quantifying how closely the system comes to achieving its stated aim.
E95-1003.txt,12,Before discussing what a term recognition system should be expected to recognize and how performance in recognition should be measured_comma_ two underlying premises should be made clear.
E95-1003.txt,13,Firstly_comma_ the automatic system is designed to recognize segments of text that_comma_ conventionally_comma_ have been manually identified by a terminologist_comma_ indexer_comma_ lexicographer or other trained individual.
E95-1003.txt,14,Secondly_comma_ the performance of automatic term recognition systems is best measured against human performance for the same task.
E95-1003.txt,15,These premises mean that for any given application terminological standardization and vocabulary compilation being the focus here it is possible to measure the performance of an automatic term recognition system_comma_ and the best yardstick for doing so is human performance.
E95-1003.txt,16,Section 2 below draws on the theory of terminology in order to qualify what a true term recognition system must achieve and what_comma_ in the short term_comma_ such systems can be expected to achieve.
E95-1003.txt,17,Section 3 specifies how the established ratios used in information retrieval recall and precision can best be adapted for measuring the recognition of single and multi word noun terms.
E95-1003.txt,18,2 What is to be Recognized
E95-1003.txt,19,Depending upon the meaning given to the expression term recognition _comma_ it can be viewed as either a rather trivial_comma_ low level processing task or one that is impossible to automate.
E95-1003.txt,20,A limited form of term recognition has been achieved using current techniques Pcrron_comma_ 1991 Bourigault_comma_ 1994 Normand_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1003.txt,21,To appreciate what current limitations are and what would be required to achieve full term recognition_comma_ it is useful to draw the distinction between term and termform on the one hand_comma_ and term recognition and term interpretation on the other.
E95-1003.txt,22,2.1 Term vs Termform Particularly in the computing community_comma_ there is a tendency to consider terms as strictly formal entities.
E95-1003.txt,23,Although usage among terminologists varies_comma_ a term is generally accepted as being the designation of a defined concept in a special language by a linguistic expression ISO_comma_ 1988 .
E95-1003.txt,24,A term is hence 17 II Concept II II II II I TERM I II I Termform I f I Figure 1 Term vs Termform the intersection between a conceptual realm a defined semantic content and a linguistic realm an expression or termform as illustrated in Figure 1.
E95-1003.txt,25,A term_comma_ thus conceived_comma_ cannot be polysemous although termforms can_comma_ and often d have several meanings.
E95-1003.txt,26,As terms precisely defined in information processing_comma_ virus and Trojan Horse are unambiguous as termforms they have other meanings in medicine and Greek mythology respectively.
E95-1003.txt,27,This view of a term has one very important consequence when discussing term recognition.
E95-1003.txt,28,Firstly_comma_ term recognition cannot be carried out on purely formal grounds.
E95-1003.txt,29,It requires some level of linguistic anMysis.
E95-1003.txt,30,Indeed_comma_ two term formation processes do not result in new termforms conversion and semantic drift 1.
E95-1003.txt,31,A third term formation process_comma_ compression_comma_ can also result in a new meaning being associated with an existing termform 2.
E95-1003.txt,32,Proper attention to capitalization can generally result in the correct recognition of compressed forms.
E95-1003.txt,33,Part of speech tagging is required to detect new terms formed through conversion.
E95-1003.txt,34,This is quite feasible using statistical taggers like those of Garside 1987 _comma_ Church 1988 or Foster 1991 which achieve performance upwards of 97 on unrestricted text.
E95-1003.txt,35,Terms formed through semantic drift are the wolves in sheep s clothing stealing through terminological pastures.
E95-1003.txt,36,They are well enough conceMcd to allude at times even the human reader and no automatic term recognition system has attempted to distinguish such terms_comma_ despite the prevalence ofpolysemy in such fields as the social sciences R.iggs_comma_ 1993 and the importance for purposes of terminological standardization that deviant usage be tracked.
E95-1003.txt,37,Implementing a system to distinguish new 1Conversion occurs when a term is formed by a change in grammatical category.
E95-1003.txt,38,Verb to noun conversion commonly occurs for commands in programming or word processing e.g. Undelete works if you catch your mistake quickly .
E95-1003.txt,39,Semantic drift involves a sometimes subtle change in meaning without any change in grammatical category viz. term as understood in this paper vs the loose Jsage of etm to mc n termform .
E95-1003.txt,40,2Compression is the shortening of usually complex termforms to form acronyms or other initialisms.
E95-1003.txt,41,Thus PAD can either designate a resistive loss in an electrical circuit or a packet assembler disassembler . meanings of established termforms would require analyzing discourse level clues that an author is assigning a new meaning_comma_ and possibly require the application of pragmatic knowledge.
E95-1003.txt,42,Until such advanced levels of analysis can be practically implemented_comma_ term recognition will largely remain termform recognition and the failure to detect new terms in old termforms will remain a qualitative shortcoming of all term recognition systems.
E95-1003.txt,43,2.2 Term Recognition vs Term Interpretation The vast majority of terms in published technical dictionaries and terminology standards are nouns.
E95-1003.txt,44,Furthermore_comma_ most terms have a complex termform_comma_ i.e. they are comprise t of more than one word.
E95-1003.txt,46,In special language_comma_ complex termforms containing nested termforms_comma_ or significant subexpressions Baudot_comma_ 1984 _comma_ have hundreds of possible syntagmatic structures Portelance_comma_ 1989 Lauriston_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1003.txt,47,The challenge facing developers of term recognition systems consists in determining the syntactic and conceptual unity that complex nominals must possess in order to achieve termhood 3 Another_comma_ and it will be argued far more ambitious_comma_ undertaking is term interpretation.
E95-1003.txt,48,Leonard 1984 _comma_ Finen 1985 and others have attempted to devise systems that can produce a gloss explicating the semantic relationship that holds between the constituents of complex nominals e.g. family estate estate owned by a family .
E95-1003.txt,49,Such attempts at achieving even limited interpretation result in large sets of possible relationships but fail to account for all compounds.
E95-1003.txt,50,Furthermore_comma_ they have generally been restricted to termforms with two constituents.
E95-1003.txt,51,For complex termforms with three or more constituents_comma_ merely identifying how constituents are nested_comma_ i.e._comma_ between which constituents there exists a semantic relationship_comma_ can be difficult to automate Sparck lones_comma_ 1985 .
E95-1003.txt,52,In most cases_comma_ however_comma_ term recognition can be achieved without interpreting the meaning of the term and without analyzing the internal structure of complex termforms.
E95-1003.txt,53,Many term recognition systems like TERMINO David_comma_ 1990 _comma_ the noun phrase detector of LOGOS Logos_comma_ 1987 _comma_ LEXTER Bourigault_comma_ 1994 _comma_ etc._comma_ nevertheless attempt to recognize nested termforms.
E95-1003.txt,54,Encountering automatic protection switching equipment _comma_ systems adopting this Sin this respect_comma_ complex termforms_comma_ unlike collocations_comma_ must designate definable nodes of the conceptual system of an area of specialized human activity.
E95-1003.txt,55,Hence general trend may be as strong a collocation as general election_comma_ and yet only the latter be considered a term.
E95-1003.txt,56,18 approach would produce as output several nested termforms switching equipment_comma_ protection switching_comma_ protection switching equipment_comma_ automatic protection_comma_ automatic protection switching as well as the maximal termform automatic protection switching equipment.
E95-1003.txt,57,Because such systems list nested termforms in the absence of higher level analysis_comma_ many erroneous terms are generated.
E95-1003.txt,58,It has been argued previously on pragmatic grounds Lauriston_comma_ 1994 that a safer approach is to detect only the maximal termform.
E95-1003.txt,59,It could further be said that doing so is theoretically sound.
E95-1003.txt,60,Nesting termforms is a means by which an author achieves transparency.
E95-1003.txt,61,Once nested_comma_ however_comma_ a termform no longer fulfills the naming function.
E95-1003.txt,62,It serves as a mnemonic device.
E95-1003.txt,63,In different languages_comma_ different nested termforms are sometimes selected to perform this mnemonic function e.g. on line credit card checking_comma_ for which a documented French equivalent is vdrification de crddit au point de vente_comma_ literally point of sale credit verification .
E95-1003.txt,64,Only the maximal termform refers to the designated concept and thus only recognition of the maximal termform constitutes term recognition 4.
E95-1003.txt,65,Term interpretation may be required_comma_ however to correctly delimit complex termforms combined by means of conjunctions.
E95-1003.txt,66,Consider the following three conjunctive expressions taken from telecommunication texts 1 buffer content and packet delay distributions 2 mean misframe and frame detection times 3 generalized intersymbol interference and jitterfree modulated signals Even the uninitiated reader would probably be inclined to interpret_comma_ correctly_comma_ that expression 1 is a combination of two complex termforms buffer content distribution and packet delay distribution.
E95-1003.txt,67,Syntax or coarse semantics do nothing_comma_ however_comma_ to prevent an incorrect reading buffer content delay distribution and buffer packet delay distribution.
E95-1003.txt,68,Expression 2 consists of words having the same sequence of grammatical categories as expression 1 _comma_ but in which this second reading is_comma_ in fact_comma_ correct mean misframe detection time and mean frame detection time.
E95-1003.txt,69,Although rather similar to the first two_comma_ conjunctive expression 3 is a single term_comma_ sometimes designated by the initialism GIJF.
E95-1003.txt,70,Complex termforms appearing in conjunctive expressions may thus require term interpretation for proper term recognition_comma_ i.e. reconstructing the conjuncts.
E95-1003.txt,71,If term recognition is to be carried out independently of and prior to term interpretation_comma_ as is This does not imply that analyzing the internal structure of complex termforms is valueless.
E95-1003.txt,72,It has the very important_comma_ but distinct_comma_ value of prodding clues to paradigmatic relationships between terms. presently feasible_comma_ then it can only be properly seen as maximal termform recognition with the meaning of maximal termform extended to include the outermost bracketing of structurally ambiguous conjunctive expressions like the three examples above.
E95-1003.txt,73,This extension in meaning is not a matter of theoretical soundness but simply of practical necessity.
E95-1003.txt,74,In summary_comma_ current systems recognize termforms but lack mechanisms to detect new terms resulting from several term formation processes_comma_ particularly semantic drift.
E95-1003.txt,75,Under these circumstances_comma_ it is best to admit that termform recognition is the currently feasible objective and to measure performance in achieving it.
E95-1003.txt,76,Furthermore_comma_ since the nested structures of complex termforms perform a mnemonic rather than a naming function_comma_ it is theoretically unsound for an automatic term recognition system to present them as terms.
E95-1003.txt,77,For purposes of measurement and comparison_comma_ term recognition should thus be regarded as maximal termform recognition .
E95-1003.txt,78,Once this goal has been reliably achieved_comma_ the output of a term recognition system could feed a future term interpreter _comma_ that would also be required to recognize terms in ambiguous conjunctive expressions.
E95-1003.txt,79,3 How Can Recognition be Measured
E95-1003.txt,80,Once a consensus has been reached about what is to be recognized_comma_ there must be some agreement concerning the way in which performance is to be measured.
E95-1003.txt,81,Fortunately_comma_ established performance measurements used in information retrieval recall and precision can be adapted quite readily for measuring the term recognition task.
E95-1003.txt,82,These measures have_comma_ in fact_comma_ been used previously in measuring term recognition Smadja_comma_ 1993 Bourigault_comma_ 1994 Lauriston_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1003.txt,83,No study_comma_ however_comma_ adequately discusses how these measurements are applied to term recognition.
E95-1003.txt,84,3.1 Recall and Precision Traditionally_comma_ performance in document retrieval is measured by means of a few simple ratios Salton_comma_ 1989 .
E95-1003.txt,85,These are based on the premise that any given document in a collection is either pertinent or non pertinent to a particular user s needs.
E95-1003.txt,86,There is no scale of relative pertinence.
E95-1003.txt,87,For a given user query_comma_ retrieving a pertinent document constitutes a hit_comma_ failing to retrieve a pertinent document constitutes a miss_comma_ and retrieving a non pertinent document constitutes a false hit.
E95-1003.txt,88,Recall_comma_ the ratio of the number of hits to the number of pertinent documents in the collection_comma_ measures the effectiveness of retrieval.
E95-1003.txt,89,Precision_comma_ the ratio of the number of hits to the number of retrieved documents_comma_ measures the e iciency of retrieval.
E95-1003.txt,90,The complement of recall is omission misses total pertinent .
E95-1003.txt,91,The complement of precision is noise false hits total retrieved .
E95-1003.txt,92,19 Ideally_comma_ recall and precision would equal 1.0_comma_ omission and noise 0.0.
E95-1003.txt,93,Practical document retrieval involves a trade off between recall and precision.
E95-1003.txt,94,The performance measurements in document retrieval are quite apparently applicable to term recognition.
E95-1003.txt,95,The basic premise of a pertinent nonpertinent dichotomy_comma_ which prevails in document retrieval_comma_ is probably even better justified for terms than for documents.
E95-1003.txt,96,Unlike an evaluation of the pertinence of the content of a document_comma_ the term nonterm distinction is based on a relatively simple and cohesive semantic contentS.User judgements of document pertinence would appear to be much more subjective and difficult to quantify.
E95-1003.txt,97,If all termforms were simple_comma_ i.e. single words_comma_ and only simple termforms were recognized_comma_ then using document retrieval measurements would be perfectly .straightforward.
E95-1003.txt,98,A manually bracketed term would give rise to a hit or a miss and an automatically recognized word would be a hit or a false hit.
E95-1003.txt,99,Since complex termforms are prevalent in sublanguage texts_comma_ however_comma_ further clarification is necessary.
E95-1003.txt,100,In particular_comma_ hit has to be defined more precisely.
E95-1003.txt,101,Consider the following sentence The latest committee draft reports progress toward constitutional reform.
E95-1003.txt,102,A terminologist would probably recognize two terms in this sentence commiLtee draft and constitutional reform.
E95-1003.txt,103,The termform of each is complex.
E95-1003.txt,104,Regardless of whether symbolic or statistical techniques are used_comma_ hits of debatable usefulness are apt to be produced by automatic term recognition systems.
E95-1003.txt,105,A syntactically based system might have particular difficulty with the three consecutive cases of noun verb ambiguity draft_comma_ reports_comma_ progress.
E95-1003.txt,106,A statistically based system might detect draft reports_comma_ since this cooccurrence might well be frequent as a termform elsewhere in the text.
E95-1003.txt,107,Consequently_comma_ the definition of hit needs further qualification.
E95-1003.txt,108,3.2 Perfect and Imperfect Recognition Two types of hits must be distinguished.
E95-1003.txt,110,An imperfect hit occurs when the boundaries assigned do not coincide with those of a term s maximal termform but contain at least one wordform belonging to a term s maximal termform.
E95-1003.txt,112,TARGET TERMFORMS misses RECOGNIZED TEKMFOKMS false perfect Jl hits hits II limperfect hitst
E95-1003.txt,115,The problematic case is clearly that of an imperfect hit.
E95-1003.txt,116,In calculating recall and precision_comma_ should imperfect hits be grouped with perfect hits_comma_ counted as misses_comma_ or somehow accounted for separately Figure 2
E95-1003.txt,117,How do the perfect recall and precision ratios compare with imperfect recall and precision including imperfect hits in the numerator when these performance measurements are applied to real texts
E95-1003.txt,118,Counting imperfectly recognized termforms as hits will obviously lead to higher ratios for recall and precision_comma_ but how much higher
E95-1003.txt,119,To answer these questions_comma_ a complex termform recognition algorithm based on weighted syntactic term formation rules_comma_ the details of which are given in Lauriston 1993 _comma_ was applied to a tagged 2_comma_861 word text.
E95-1003.txt,120,The weightings were based on the analysis of a 117_comma_000 word corpus containing 11_comma_614 complex termforms as determined by manual bracketing.
E95-1003.txt,121,The recognition algorithm includes the possibility of weighting of the terminological strength of particular adjectives.
E95-1003.txt,122,This was carried out to produce the results shown in Figure 3.
E95-1003.txt,123,Recall and precision_comma_ both perfect and imperfect_comma_ were plotted as the algorithm s term recognition threshold was varied.
E95-1003.txt,124,By choosing a higher threshold_comma_ only syntactically stronger links between adjacent words are considered terminological links .
E95-1003.txt,125,Thus the higher the threshold_comma_ the shorter the average complex termform_comma_ as weaker modifiers are 20 1.0 0.9 08 O7 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 r r r r r r r r r r p r r r p r p r r r p r p r r r p r p Rr Rr p r p r p Rr p Rr p r p r p Rr p Rr p r p r p Rr p Rr p r p r p Rr p Rr p r p r p Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp r p Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp r p Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp r p Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp Rr Pp   0.05 0.40 0.75 0.95 term recognition threshold KEY R perfect recall perfect hits only r imperfect recall imperfect also P perfect precision perfect hits only p imperfect precision imperfect also Figure 3 Effect of Imperfect Hits of Performance Ratios stripped from the nucleus.
E95-1003.txt,126,Lower recall and higher precision can be expected as the threshold rises since only constituents that are surer bets are included in the maximal termform.
E95-1003.txt,127,This Figure 3 shows that both recall and precision scores are considerably higher when imperfect hits are included in calculating the ratios.
E95-1003.txt,128,As expected_comma_ raising the threshold results in lower recall regardless of whether the ratios are calculated for perfect or imperfect recognition.
E95-1003.txt,129,There is a marked reduction in perfect recall_comma_ however_comma_ and only a marginal reduction in imperfect recall.
E95-1003.txt,130,The precision ratios provide the most interesting point of comparison.
E95-1003.txt,131,As the threshold is raised_comma_ imperfect precision increases just as the principle of recall precision tradeoff in document retrieval would lead one to expect.
E95-1003.txt,132,Perfect precision_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ actually declines slightly.
E95-1003.txt,133,The difference between perfect and imperfect precision between the P bar and p bar in each group increases appreciably as the threshold is raised.
E95-1003.txt,134,This difference is due to the greater number of recognized complex termforms either containing spurious words or only part of the maximal termform.
E95-1003.txt,135,Two conclusions can be drawn from Figure 3.
E95-1003.txt,136,Firstly_comma_ the recognition algorithm implemented is poor at perfect recognition perfect recall _comma_ 0.70 perfect precision _comma_ 0.40 and only becomes poorer as more stringent rule weighting is applied.
E95-1003.txt,137,Secondly_comma_ and more importantly for the purpose of this paper_comma_ Figure 3 shows that allowing for imperfect bracketing in term recognition makes it possible to obtain artificially high performance ratios for both recall and precision.
E95-1003.txt,138,Output that recognizes almost all terms but includes spurious words in complex termforms or fails short of recognizing the entire termform leaves a burdensome filtering task for the human user and is next to useless if the user is another level of automatic text processing.
E95-1003.txt,139,Only the exact bracketing of the maximal termform provides a useful standard for measuring and comparing the performance of term recognition systems.
E95-1003.txt,140,4 Conclusion The term recognition criteria proposed above measuring recall and precision for the exact bracketing of maximal termforms provide a basic minimum of information needed to assess system performance.
E95-1003.txt,141,For some applications_comma_ it is useful to further specify how these performance ratios differ for the recognition of simple and complex termforms_comma_ how they vary for terms resulting from different term formation processes_comma_ what the ratios are for termform types as opposed to tokens_comma_ or how well the system recognizes novel termforms not already in a system lexicon or previously encountered in a training corpus.
E95-1003.txt,142,Precision measurements might usefully state to what extent errors are due to syntactic noise bracketing crossing syntactic constituents as distinguished from terminological noise bracketing including nonclassificatory modifiers or omitting classificatory ones .
E95-1003.txt,143,Publishing such performance results for termrecognition systems would not only display their strengths but also expose their weaknesses.
E95-1003.txt,144,Doing so would ultimately benefit researchers_comma_ developers and users of term recognltion systems. .
E95-1031.txt,1,extragrammatical sentence is what a normal parser fails to analyze. It is important to recover it using only syntactic information although results of recovery are better if semantic factors are considered.
E95-1031.txt,2,A general algorithm .for least errors recognition_comma_ which is based only on syntactic information_comma_ was proposed by G.
E95-1031.txt,3,Lyon to deal with the extragrammaticality.
E95-1031.txt,4,We extended this algorithm to recover extragrammatical sentence into grammatical one in running text.
E95-1031.txt,5,Our robust parser with recovery mechanism extended general algorithm for least errors recognition can be easily scaled up and modified because it utilize only syntactic information.
E95-1031.txt,6,To upgrade this robust parser we proposed heuristics through the analysis on the Penn treebank corpus.
E95-1031.txt,7,The experimental result shows 68 _comma_ 77 accuracy in error recovery.
E95-1031.txt,9,ExtragrammaticM sentences include patently ungrammatical constructions as well as utterances that may be grammaticMly acceptable but are beyond the syntactic coverage of a parser_comma_ and any other difficult ones that are encountered in parsing Carbonell and Hayes_comma_ 1983 .
E95-1031.txt,10,I am sure this is what he means.
E95-1031.txt,11,This is_comma_ I am sure_comma_ what he means.
E95-1031.txt,12,The progress of machine does not stop even a day.
E95-1031.txt,13,Not even a day does the progress of machine stop.
E95-1031.txt,14,Above examples show that people are used to write same meaningful sentences differently.
E95-1031.txt,15,In addition_comma_ people are prone to mistakes in writing sentences.
E95-1031.txt,16,So_comma_ the bulk of written sentences are open to the extragrammaticality.
E95-1031.txt,17,In the Penn treebank tree tagged corpus Marcus_comma_ 1991 _comma_ for instance_comma_ about 80 percents of the rules are concerned with peculiar sentences which include inversive_comma_ elliptic_comma_ parenthetic_comma_ or emphatic phrases.
E95-1031.txt,18,For example_comma_ we can drive a rule VP _comma_ vb NP comma rb comma PP from the following sentence. S The same jealousy can breed confusion_comma_ however_comma_ in the absence of any authorization bill this year. NP The dr ADJP ea e jj jealousy nn can md VP breed vb NP confusion nn _comma_ _comma_ however rb _comma_ _comma_ PP in in NP NP the dr absence nn PP orlon NP anyldt auZhorization nnbi11 nn NP this dt yearlnn  . . A robust parser is one that can analyze these extragrammaticalsentences without failure.
E95-1031.txt,19,However_comma_ if we try to preserve robustness by adding such rules whenever we encounter an extragrammatical sentence_comma_ the rulebase will grow up rapidly_comma_ and thus processing and maintaining the excessive number of rules will become inefficient and impractical.
E95-1031.txt,20,Therefore_comma_ extragrammatical sentences should be handled by some recovery mechanism s rather than by a set of additional rules.
E95-1031.txt,21,Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network ATN Kwasny and Sondheimer_comma_ 1981 _comma_ network based semantic grammar Hendrix_comma_ 1977 _comma_ partial pattern matching Hayes and Mouradian_comma_ 1981 _comma_ conceptual case frame Schank et al._comma_ 1980 _comma_ and multiple cooperating methods Hayes and Carbonell_comma_ 1981 .
E95-1031.txt,22,Above mentioned techniques take into account various semantic factors depending on specific domains on question in recovering extragrammatical sentences.
E95-1031.txt,24,Therefore_comma_ it is 223 important to recover extragrammatical sentences using syntactic factors only_comma_ which are independent of any particular system and any particular domain.
E95-1031.txt,25,Mellish Mellish_comma_ 1989 introduced some chartbased techniques using only syntactic information for extragrammatical sentences.
E95-1031.txt,26,This technique has an advantage that there is no repeating work for the chart to prevent the parser from generating the same edge as the previously existed edge.
E95-1031.txt,27,Also_comma_ because the recovery process runs when a normal parser terminates unsuccessfully_comma_ the performance of the normal parser does not decrease in case of handling grammatical sentences.
E95-1031.txt,28,However_comma_ his experiment was not based on the errors in running texts but on artificial ones which were randomly generated by human.
E95-1031.txt,29,Moreover_comma_ only one word error was considered though several word errors can occur simultaneously in the running text.
E95-1031.txt,30,A general algorithm for least errors recognition Lyon_comma_ 1974 _comma_ proposed by G.
E95-1031.txt,31,Lyon_comma_ is to find out the least number of errors necessary to successful parsing and recover them.
E95-1031.txt,32,Because this algorithm is also syntactically oriented and baaed on a chart_comma_ it has the same advantzrge as that of Mellish s parser.
E95-1031.txt,33,When the original parsing algorithm terminates unsuccessfully_comma_ the algorithm begins to assume errors of insertion_comma_ deletion and mutation of a word.
E95-1031.txt,34,For any input_comma_ including grammatical and extragrammatical sentences_comma_ this algorithm can generate the resultant parse tree.
E95-1031.txt,35,At the cost of the complete robustness_comma_ however_comma_ this algorithm degrades the efficiency of parsing_comma_ and generates many intermediate edges.
E95-1031.txt,36,In this paper_comma_ we present a robust parser with a recovery mechanism.
E95-1031.txt,37,We extend the general algorithm for least errors recognition to adopt it as the recovery mechanism in our robust parser.
E95-1031.txt,38,Because our robust parser handle extragrammatical sentences with this syntactic information oriented recovery mechanism_comma_ it can be independent of a particular system or particular domain.
E95-1031.txt,39,Also_comma_ we present the heuristics to reduce the number of edges so that we can upgrade the performance of our parser.
E95-1031.txt,40,This paper is organized as follows We first review a general algorithm for least errors recognition.
E95-1031.txt,41,Then we present the extension of this algorithm_comma_ and the heuristics adopted by the robust parser.
E95-1031.txt,42,Next_comma_ we describe the implementation of the system and the result of the experiment of parsing real sentences.
E95-1031.txt,43,Finally_comma_ we make conclusion with future direction.
E95-1031.txt,44,2 Algorithm and Heuristics 2.1 General algorithm for least errors recognition The general algorithm for least errors recognition Lyon_comma_ 1974 _comma_ which is based on Earley s algorithm_comma_ assumes that sentences may have insertion_comma_ RULE T a INPUT t i lnutation error _comma_ ............. ._comma_  ................ . hypothesis . . perfec match deletion error  _comma_ T  u .

E95-1031.txt,46,The objective of this algorithm is to parse input string with the least number of errors.
E95-1031.txt,47,A state used in this algorithm is quadruple p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma_ e J_comma_ where p is a production number in grammar_comma_ j marks a position in RHS p _comma_ fis a start position of the state in input string_comma_ and e is an error value.
E95-1031.txt,48,1 A final state p_comma_ p_ I 1_comma_ f_comma_ e denotes recognition of a phrase RHS p with e errors where _p is a number of components in rule p.
E95-1031.txt,49,A stateset S i _comma_ where i is the position of the input_comma_ is an ordered set of states.
E95-1031.txt,50,States within a stateset are ordered by ascending value of 3 _comma_ within a p within a f f takes descending value.
E95-1031.txt,51,When adding to statesets_comma_ ff state p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma_ e is a candidate for admission to a stateset which already has a similar member p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma__comma_ e and e _ e_comma_ then p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma_ e is rejected.
E95-1031.txt,52,However_comma_ if e e_comma_ then p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma_ e is replaced by p_comma_ j_comma_ f_comma_ e .
E95-1031.txt,53,The algorithm works as follows A procedure SCAN is carried out for each state in S i .
E95-1031.txt,54,SCAN checks various correspondences of input token t i against terminal symbols in RHS of rules.
E95-1031.txt,55,Once SCAN is done_comma_ COMPLETER substitutes all final states of S i into all other analyses which can use them as components.
E95-1031.txt,56,SCAN SCAN handles states of S i _comma_ checking each input terminal against requirements of states in S i and various error hypotheses.
E95-1031.txt,57,Figure 1 shows how SCAN processes.
E95-1031.txt,60,In other words_comma_ it means the recognition of a noun phrase.
E95-1031.txt,61,extended COMPLETER If there is a final state s  p _comma_p 1_comma_ k_comma_ e in S i _comma_ phrase perfect match If there exists a state s  p_comma_ j_comma_ x_comma_ e in S k _comma_ t i and j L S f then add s p_comma_ j 1_comma_ z_comma_ e e into S i . phrase insertion error hypothesis a If there exists a state s  p_comma_ j_comma_ z_comma_ e in S k then add s p_comma_j_comma_z_comma_e _comma__comma__comma_r_comma_o_comma_ into S i if possible.
E95-1031.txt,62,Yinaertion is the cost of a insertion error for a nonterminal symbol.
E95-1031.txt,64,In phrase insertion error hypothesis of figure 2_comma_ the original sentence is Other countries_comma_ including West Germany_comma_ m y hgve ... _comma_ where the inserted phrase VP is surrounded by commas.
E95-1031.txt,65,So_comma_ the substring comma V comma should be dealt with as a constituent in extended COMPLETER.
E95-1031.txt,66,In fact_comma_ we implemented the algorithm to allow substring insertions _comma_ well as insertions of nontermlnal nodes.
E95-1031.txt,67,S IS NP.
E95-1031.txt,69,The extended least errors recognition algorithm can handle not only terminal errors but also nonterminal errors.
E95-1031.txt,70,2.3 Heuristics The robust pa ser using the extended least errors recognition algorithm overgenerates many errorhypothesis edges during parsing process.
E95-1031.txt,71,To cope with this problem_comma_ we adjust error values according to the following heuristics.
E95-1031.txt,72,Edges with more error values are regarded as less important ones_comma_ so that those edges are processed later than those of less error values.
E95-1031.txt,73,tWe know that the phrase mutation error hypothesis is not meaningful in the red text because we cannot find out any example of phrase mutation error in the corpus.
E95-1031.txt,74,So we didn t implement the phrase mutationerror hypothesis.
E95-1031.txt,75,225 Heuristics 1 error types The analysis on 3_comma_538 sentences of the Penn treebank corpus WS I shows that there are 498 sentences with phrase deletions and 224 sentences with phrase insertions.
E95-1031.txt,76,So_comma_ we assign less error value to the deletion error hypothesis edge than to the insertion and mutation errors. a  deletion Oeinsertion mutation deletion insergiort where is the error cost of a terminal symbol_comma_ is the error cost of a nonterminal symbol. Heuristics 2 fiducial nonterminal People often make mistakes in writing English.
E95-1031.txt,77,These mistakes usually take place rather between small constituents such as a verbal phrase_comma_ an adverbial phrase and noun phrase than within small constituents themselves.
E95-1031.txt,78,The possibility of error occurrence within noun phrases are lower than between a noun phrase and a verbal phrase_comma_ a preposition phrase_comma_ an adverbial phrase.
E95-1031.txt,79,So_comma_ we assume some phrases_comma_ for example noun phrases_comma_ as fiducial nonterminals_comma_ which means error free nonterminals.
E95-1031.txt,80,When handling sentences_comma_ the robust parser assings more error values 61 to the error hypothesis edge occurring within a fiducial nonterminal. Heuristics 3 kinds of terminal symbols Some terminal symbols like punctuation symbols_comma_ conjunctions and particles are often misused.
E95-1031.txt,81,So_comma_ the robust parser assigns less error values 52 to the error hypothesis edges with these symbols than to the other terminal symbols. Heuristics 4 inserted phrases between commas or parentheses Most of inserted phrases are surrounded by commas or parentheses.
E95-1031.txt,82,For example_comma_ a.
E95-1031.txt,83,They re active _comma_ generally _comma_ at night or on damp_comma_ cloudy days. b.
E95-1031.txt,84,All refrigerators _comma_ whether they are defrosted manually or not_comma_ need to be cleaned.
E95-1031.txt,86,I was a last minute read intedopin9 attendee at a French journalism convention . .
E95-1031.txt,87,We will assign less error values 6a to the insertion error hypothesis edges of nonterminals which are embraced by comma or parenthesis.
E95-1031.txt,88,61 and 62 are weights for the error of terminal nodes_comma_ and 68 is a weight for the error of nonterminal nodes.
E95-1031.txt,89,The error value e of an edge is calculated as follows.
E95-1031.txt,90,All error values are additive.
E95-1031.txt,91,The error value e for a rule X alAla2.._comma_ a Aj_comma_ where a is a terminal node and A is a nonterminal node_comma_ is 1. e eT e 61 62 if terminal error 2.

E95-1031.txt,94,By these heuristics_comma_ our robust parser can process only plausible edges first_comma_ inste i of processing all generated edges at the same time_comma_ so that we can enhance the performance of the robust parser and result in the great reduction in the number of resultant trees.
E95-1031.txt,95,3 Implementation and Evaluation 3.1 The robust parser Our robust parsing system is composed of two modules.
E95-1031.txt,96,One module is a normal parser which is the bottom up chart parser.
E95-1031.txt,97,The other is a robust parser with the error recovery mechanism proposed herein.
E95-1031.txt,98,At first_comma_ an input sentence is processed by the normal parser.
E95-1031.txt,99,If the sentence is within the grammatical coverage of the system_comma_ the normal parser succeed to analyze it.
E95-1031.txt,100,Otherwise_comma_ the normal parser fails_comma_ and then the robust parser starts to execute with edges generated by the normal parser.
E95-1031.txt,101,The result of the robust parser is the parse trees which are within the grammatical coverage of the system.
E95-1031.txt,102,The overview of the system is shown in figure 3. ._comma_ t _comma__comma_..o_comma__comma_ Figure 3 The overview of the system 3.2 Experimental result To show usefulness of the robust parser proposed in this paper_comma_ we made some experiments. Rule We can derive 4_comma_958 rules and their frequencies out of 14_comma_137 sentences in the Penn 226 Table 1 The results of the robust parser on WSJ Experiment 1 WSJ 410 sentences with Heuristics without Heuristics Average sentence length Average processing time Average number of edges Accuracy  no crossing sentences of 1 crossing sentences of 2 crossing sentences 16.27 words 2 25 words 6.52 sec 7726.03 77.1 23.28 40.52 55.17 16.27 words 2 25 words 22.47 sec 10346.6 72.8 20.28 37.14 48.57 treebank tree tagged corpus_comma_ the Wall Street Journal.
E95-1031.txt,103,The average frequency of each rule is 48 times in the corpus.
E95-1031.txt,104,Of these rules_comma_ we remove rules which occurs fewer times than the average frequency in the corpus_comma_ and then only 192 rules are left.
E95-1031.txt,105,These removed rules are almost for peculiar sentences and the left rules are very general rules.
E95-1031.txt,106,We can show that our robust parser can compensate for lack of rules using only 192 rules with the recovery mechanism and heuristics. Test set First_comma_ 1_comma_000 sentences are selected randomly from the WSJ corpus_comma_ which we have referred to in proposing the robust parser.
E95-1031.txt,107,Of these sentences_comma_ 410 are failed in normal parsing_comma_ and are processed again by the robust parser.
E95-1031.txt,108,To show the validity of these heuristics_comma_ we compare the result of the robust parser using heuristics with one not using heuristics.
E95-1031.txt,109,Second_comma_ to show the adaptability of our robust parser_comma_ same experiments are carried out on 1_comma_000 sentences from the ATIS corpus in Penn treebank_comma_ which we haven t referred to when we propose the robust parser.
E95-1031.txt,110,Among 1_comma_000 sentences from the ATIS_comma_ 465 sentences are processed by the robust parser after the failure of the normal parsing. Parameter adjustment We chose the best parameters of heuristics by executing several experiments.

E95-1031.txt,112,Table 1 shows the results of the robust parser on WSJ.
E95-1031.txt,113,In table 1_comma_ 5th_comma_ 6th and 7th raw mean that the percentage of sentences which have no crossing constituents_comma_ less than one crossing and less than two crossing respectively.
E95-1031.txt,114,With heuristics_comma_ our robust parser can enhance the processing time and reduce the number of edges.
E95-1031.txt,115,Also_comma_ the accuracy is improved from 72.8 to 77.1 even if the heuristics differentiate edges and prefer some edges.
E95-1031.txt,116,It shows that the proposed heuristics is valid in parsing the real sentences.
E95-1031.txt,117,The experiment says that our robust parser with heuristics can recover perfectly about 23 sentences out of 100 sentences which axe just failed in normal parsing_comma_ as the percentage of no crossing sentences is about 23.28 .
E95-1031.txt,118,Table 2 is the results of the robust parser on ATIS which we did not refer to before.
E95-1031.txt,119,The accuracy of the result on ATIS is lower than WSJ because the parameters of the heuristics are a justed not by ATIS itself but by WSJ.
E95-1031.txt,120,However_comma_ the percentage of sentences with constituents crossing less than 2 is higher than the WSJ_comma_ as sentences of ATIS are more or less simple.
E95-1031.txt,121,The experimental results of our robust parser show high accuracy in recovery even though 96 of total rules are removed.
E95-1031.txt,122,It is impossible to construct complete grammar rules in the real parsing system to succeed in analyzing every real sentence.
E95-1031.txt,123,So_comma_ parsing systems are likely to have extragrammatical sentences which cannot be analyzed by the systems.
E95-1031.txt,124,Our robust parser can recover these extragrammatical sentences with 68 77 accuracy.
E95-1031.txt,125,It is very interesting that parameters of heuristics reflect the characteristics of the test corpus.
E95-1031.txt,126,For example_comma_ if people tend to write sentences with inserted phrases_comma_ then the parameter fli_comma_ sert on must increase.
E95-1031.txt,127,Therefore we can get better results if the parameter are fitted to the characteristics of the corpus.
E95-1031.txt,128,4 Conclusion In this paper_comma_ we have presented the robust parser with the extended least errors recognition algorithm as the recovery mechanism.
E95-1031.txt,129,This robust parser can easily be scaled up and applied to various domains because this parser depends only on syntactic factors.
E95-1031.txt,130,To enhance the performance of the robust parser for extragrainmatical sentences_comma_ 227 Table 2 The results of the robust parser on ATIS Experiment 2 ATIS 465 sentences Average sentence length Average processing time Average number of edges Accuracy  no crossing sentences of _ 1 crossing sentences of _ 2 crossing sentences with Heuristics without Heuristics 10.55 words 2 25 words 8.68 sec 12974.2 68.5 26.02 47.10 66.24 10.55 words 2 25 words 71.98 sec 25652.5 59.4 13.28 36.06 52.46 we proposed several heuristics.
E95-1031.txt,131,The heuristics assign the error values to each error hypothesis edge_comma_ and edges which has less error values axe processed first.
E95-1031.txt,132,So_comma_ not all the generated edges are processed by the robust parser_comma_ but the most plausible parse trees can be generated first.
E95-1031.txt,133,The accuracy of the recovery in our robust parser is about 68 _comma__comma_ 77 .
E95-1031.txt,134,Hence_comma_ this parser is suitable for systems in real application areas.
E95-1031.txt,135,Our short term goal is to propose an automatic method that can learn parameter values of heuristics by analyzing the corpus.
E95-1031.txt,136,We expect that automatically leaxned values of parameters can upgrade the performance of the parser.

E95-1033.txt,1,provide a unified account of sentence level and text level anaphora within the framework of a dependency based grammar model. Criteria for anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries rephrase major concepts from GB s binding theory_comma_ while those for text level anaphora incorporate an adapted version of a Grosz Sidner style focus model.
E95-1033.txt,3,This paper treats the resolution of anaphora within the framework of Parse Talk_comma_ a dependencyoriented grammar model that incorporates strict lexicalization_comma_ head orientation based on valency specifications _comma_ feature unification_comma_ and inheritance among lexicalized grammar specifications Br6ker et al._comma_ 1994 Hahn et al._comma_ 1994 .
E95-1033.txt,4,The results we present rest upon two major assumptions 1.
E95-1033.txt,5,As many forms of anaphors e.g._comma_ nominal and pronominal anaphors occur within sentence boundaries so called intra sentential or sentence anaphora and beyond intersentential or text anaphora _comma_ adequate theories of anaphora should allow the formulation of grammatical regularities for both types using a common set of grammatical primitives.
E95-1033.txt,7,Anaphora are only one_comma_ yet very prominent phenomenon that yields textual cohesion in discourse.
E95-1033.txt,8,Adequate grammars should therefore also be easily extensible to cover nonanaphoric text phenomena e.g._comma_ coherence relations_comma_ rhetorical predicates _comma_ which provide for additional levels of text macro structure_comma_ with descriptions stated at the same level of theoretical sophistication as for anaphora.
E95-1033.txt,9,First_comma_ we will briefly compare our approach with work done in the context of government binding GB grammar and discourse representation the ory DRT .
E95-1033.txt,10,As we conceive it_comma_ binding theory as developed within the GB framework Chomsky_comma_ 1981 Kuno_comma_ 1987 offers one of the most sophisticated approaches for treating anaphora at the sentence level of description.
E95-1033.txt,11,This has also been recognized by advocates of competing grammar formalisms_comma_ who have elaborated on GB s binding principles cf._comma_ e.g._comma_ Pollard and Sag 1992 within the context of HPSG_comma_ whose treatment is nevertheless restricted to reflexive pronouns .
E95-1033.txt,12,Interestingly enough_comma_ when faced with some crucial linguistic phenomena_comma_ such as topicalization_comma_ GB must assume rather complex movement operations in order to cope with the data in a satisfactory manner.
E95-1033.txt,13,Things get even more complicated when languages with relatively free word order_comma_ such as German_comma_ are taken into account.
E95-1033.txt,14,Finally_comma_ considering the case of text anaphora_comma_ binding theory has nothing to offer at all.
E95-1033.txt,15,Another strong alternative for considering anaphora constitutes the framework of DRT Kamp and Reyle_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1033.txt,16,Its development can be considered a landmark in the model theoretic semantic analysis of various forms of quantified sentences_comma_ conditionals_comma_ and anaphorically linked multi sentential discourse.
E95-1033.txt,17,At this level of description_comma_ DRT is clearly superior to GB.
E95-1033.txt,18,On the other hand_comma_ its lack of an equally thorough treatment of complex syntactic constructions makes it inferior to GB.
E95-1033.txt,19,These deficits are no wonder_comma_ since DRT is not committed to any particular syntactic theory_comma_ and thus cannot place strict enough syntactic constraints on the admissible constituent structures.
E95-1033.txt,20,Focusing on the text analysis potential of DRT_comma_ its complex machinery might work in a satisfactory way for several well studied forms of anaphora_comma_ but it necessarily fails if various non anaphoric text phenomena need to be interpreted.
E95-1033.txt,21,This is particularly true of conceptually rooted and pragmatically driven inferences necessary to build up textual macro structures in terms of coherence relations Hobbs_comma_ 1982 or rhetorical structures Mann and Thompson_comma_ 1988 .
E95-1033.txt,22,This shortcoming is simply due to the fact that DRT is basically a semantic theory_comma_ not a comprehensive model for text understanding it lacks any systematic connec237 tion to comprehensive reasoning systems covering the conceptual knowledge and specific problemsolving models underlying the chosen domain.
E95-1033.txt,23,Summing up_comma_ DRT is fairly restricted both with respect to the incorporation of powerful syntactic constraints at the sentence level and its extension to the level of non anaphoric text macro structures.
E95-1033.txt,24,GB_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ is strong with respect to the specification of binding conditions at the sentence level_comma_ but offers no opportunity at all to extend its analytic scope beyond that sentential level.
E95-1033.txt,25,We claim_comma_ however_comma_ that the dependencybased grammar model underlying ParseTalk 1. covers intra sentential anaphora at the same level of descriptive adequacy as current GB_comma_ although it provides less complex representation structures than GB analyses these structures are nevertheless expressive enough to capture the relevant distinctions_comma_ 2. does not exhibit an increasing level of structural complexity when faced with crucial linguistic phenomena which cause considerable problems for current GB theory_comma_ 3. goes beyond GB in that it allows the treatment of anaphora at the text level of description within the same grammar formalism as is used for sentence level anaphora_comma_ and_comma_ 4. goes beyond the anaphora centered treatment of text structure characteristic of the DRT approach in that it already accounts for the resolution of text level ellipsis sometimes also referred to as functional anaphora_comma_ cf. Hahn and Strube 1995 and the interpretation of text macro structures a preliminary study is presented in Hahn 1992 .
E95-1033.txt,26,2 DG Constraints on Anaphora In this section_comma_ we present_comma_ quite informally_comma_ some constraints on intra sentential anaphora in terms of dependency grammar DG .
E95-1033.txt,27,We will reconsider these constraints in Section 3_comma_ where our grammar model is dealt with in more depth.
E95-1033.txt,28,We provide here a definition of d binding and two constraints which describe the use of reflexive pronouns and anaphors personal pronouns and definite noun phrases .
E95-1033.txt,29,These constraints cover approximately the same phenomena as the binding theory of GB Chomsky 1981 for a computational treatment_comma_ cf.
E95-1033.txt,30,Correa 1988 .
E95-1033.txt,31,Dependency structures_comma_ by definition_comma_ refer to the sentence level of linguistic description only.
E95-1033.txt,32,The relation of dependency holds between a lexical head and one or several modifiers of that head_comma_ such that the occurrence of a head allows for the occurrence of one or several modifiers in some pre specified linear ordering _comma_ but not vice versa.
E95-1033.txt,33,Speaking in terms of dependency structure representations_comma_ the head always precedes and_comma_ thus_comma_ transitively governs its associated modifiers in the dependency tree.
E95-1033.txt,34,This basic notion of government must be further refined for the description of anaphoric relations in dependency trees we do not claim a universal status for the following constraints_comma_ but restrict their validity to the description of the German language D bindlng A modifier M is d bound by some head H_comma_ if no node N intervenes between M and H for which one of the following conditions holds i node N represents a finite verb_comma_ or ii node N represents a noun with a possessive modifier_comma_ i.e._comma_ possessive determiners_comma_ Saxon genitive_comma_ genitival and prepositional attributes.
E95-1033.txt,35,Based on the definition of d binding_comma_ we are able to specify several constraints on reflexive pronouns and anaphors in DG terms Reflexive pronoun The reflexive pronoun and the antecedent to which the reflexive pronoun refers are d bound by the same head.
E95-1033.txt,36,Pronominal and nominal anaphors i The antecedent c to which an anaphor r refers must not be governed by the same head which d binds 7r_comma_ unless ii applies.
E95-1033.txt,37,ii The antecedent to which an anaphor r refers may only be governed by the same head H1 which d binds 7r_comma_ if is a modifier of a head Hg_comma_ H2 is governed by H1_comma_ and a precedes 7r in the linear sequence of text items. Hence_comma_ a is not d bound by the head H1 which d binds 7r. I We will now illustrate the working of these constraints_comma_ starting with the consideration of reflexives. Usually_comma_ the antecedent of a reflexive pronoun is the subject of the clause to which the reflexive belongs. In 1 _comma_ the subject Maria is dbound by the same head as the reflexive sich.
E95-1033.txt,38,1 Mariai w scht sichi.
E95-1033.txt,40,For instance_comma_ a preposition may occur between reflexive and verb_comma_ since the notion of dbinding does not discriminate between NPs and PPs of. 2 .
E95-1033.txt,41,If the finite verb is a modal or auxiliary verb_comma_ one or more non finite verbs may occur between the reflexive and the finite verb cf. 3 .
E95-1033.txt,42,1 The definition of d binding roughly corresponds to the governing categoryin GB terminology_comma_ which relies upon the notion of c command_comma_ while the latter two grammar constraints correspond to the three major binding principles of GB.
E95-1033.txt,43,238 2 Mariai lacht fiber sichi.
E95-1033.txt,46,Though Maria is the subject of 4 _comma_ only Peter can be considered the antecedent of the reflexive_comma_ since it is d bound by the head which d binds Peter_comma_ viz.
E95-1033.txt,47,Geschichte cf. Fig. 1 .
E95-1033.txt,48,If the intermediate noun has no possessive modifiers_comma_ the subject of the entire clause is the antecedent of the reflexive_comma_ since the reflexive is d bound by the finite verb irrespective of the occurrence of the object NP cf. 6 . erz a.l.t Maz 1 Gemo..h c te pObj Figure 1 Dependency Tree for Examples 4 and 5 4 Maria erz .hlt Peters Geschichte fiber sich .
E95-1033.txt,51,As a general rule_comma_ the anaphor must not occupy the position of the reflexive pronoun.
E95-1033.txt,52,Hence_comma_ for all the examples given above_comma_ any of those sentences becomes ungrammatical if the reflexives are replaced by non reflexive anaphoric expressions of. 7 vs. 2 .
E95-1033.txt,54,On the other hand_comma_ if the anaphor belongs to the matrix clause and the antecedent to the subordinate clause_comma_ coreference is excluded cf. 9 .
E95-1033.txt,55,But one can easily think of cases where this rule is overridden.
E95-1033.txt,56,Consider_comma_ e.g._comma_ a subordinate clause preceding its matrix_comma_ as is always true for topicalizations.
E95-1033.txt,57,The claim that a pronoun in the superordinate clause must not be coreferent to an antecedent in a subordinate clause is then obviously false cf. 10 and 11 .
E95-1033.txt,58,In 10 _comma_ the antecedent Peteris not d bound by the head which d binds the anaphor er_comma_ and Peter precedes er.
E95-1033.txt,59,Therefore_comma_ coreference is possible.
E95-1033.txt,60,2 8 Peter erwartet_comma_ daft eri einen Brief bekommt.
E95-1033.txt,64,In this case the antecedent of a pronoun may be governed by the head which d binds the pronoun.
E95-1033.txt,65,In 12 the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause_comma_ but in 13 the antecedent of the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause_comma_ and the example seems to be acceptable.
E95-1033.txt,66,In 14 _comma_ where the subject Valet is modified by the genitive attribute des Gewinners_comma_ the antecedent is governed by the head which also d binds the pronoun.
E95-1033.txt,67,Both the relative clause and the genitive attribute are modifiers of the subject_comma_ which usually occurs at the first position in the German main clause.
E95-1033.txt,68,In this case_comma_ the antecedent precedes the anaphor.

E95-1033.txt,74,In 15 _comma_ the subordinate clause immediately follows its head word_comma_ while in 16 the subordinate clause is extraposed.
E95-1033.txt,75,In 16 the anaphor precedes its antecedent_comma_ which is governed by the head that dbinds the anaphor.
E95-1033.txt,76,This violates the given constraints_comma_ hence coreference is excluded.
E95-1033.txt,77,2GB explains topicalizatiou with a move of the topicalized CP into the SpecComp phrase of the highest CP_comma_ so that the pronoun does not c commandits antecedent in these cases movements into an A position are assumed for which the binding principles of GB do not apply .
E95-1033.txt,78,3GB explains this phenomenon by linking the modifiers to the subject as adjuncts.
E95-1033.txt,79,In this position_comma_ the pronoun does not c command the antecedent_comma_ and the adjunct of the subject is also in an A position.
E95-1033.txt,80,239 15 Die Frage_comma_ ob Peteri nach Dublin fahren sollte_comma_ konnte eri noch nicht beantworten.
E95-1033.txt,82,Morphosyntactic conditions require that a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender_comma_ number and person_comma_ while a definite NP must agree with its antecedent in number only.
E95-1033.txt,83,Moreover_comma_ conceptual criteria have to be met as in the case of nominal anaphors which must subsume their antecedents at the conceptual level.
E95-1033.txt,84,Similarly_comma_ for pronominal anaphors the selected antecedent must be permitted in those conceptual roles connecting the pronominal anaphors and its grammatical head.
E95-1033.txt,85,The DG constraints for the use of reflexives and intra sentential anaphora cover approximately the same phenomena as GB_comma_ but the structures used by DG analysis are less complex than those of GB and do not require the formal machinery of empty categories_comma_ binding chains and complex movements cf. Lappin and McCord 1990_comma_ p.205 for a similar argument .

E95-1039.txt,1,paper describes the use of statistical analyses of untagged corpora to detect similarities and differences in the meaning of words in text. This work is motivated by psychological as well as by computational issues.
E95-1039.txt,2,The limitations of the method of cluster analysis in assessing the success of such analyses are discussed_comma_ and ongoing research using an alternative unsupervised neural network approach is described. .
E95-1039.txt,3,There has been considerable recent interest in the use of statistical methods for grouping words in large on line corpora into categories which capture some of our intuitions about the reference of the words we use and the relationships between them e.g. Brown et al._comma_ 1992 Schiitze_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1039.txt,4,Although they have received most attention from within computational linguistics_comma_ such approaches are also of interest from the point of view of psychology.
E95-1039.txt,5,The huge task of developing concepts of word meanings is one that human beings readily achieve we are all generally aware of the similarities and differences between the meanings of words_comma_ despite the fact that in many cases these meanings are not amenable to rigourous definition.
E95-1039.txt,6,Whilst supervision may enable children to learn the meanings of a limited number of common words_comma_ it seems extremely unlikely that the greater part of our understanding of word meanings is achieved in this way.
E95-1039.txt,7,Experimental evidence shows Harris_comma_ 1992 that the occurrence of words in young children s language is strongly influenced by the appearance of those words in the speech they hear around them_comma_ and it may be that this process continues indefinitely.
E95-1039.txt,8,Such a process would seem to be particularly important when accounting for our understanding of .
E95-1032.txt,1,paper describes a substitutional approach to ellipsis resolution giving comparable results to Dalrymple et al._comma_ 1991 _comma_ but without the need for order sensitive interleaving of quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution. It is argued that the orderindependence results from viewing semantic interpretation as building a description of a semantic composition_comma_ instead of the more common view of interpretation as actually performing the composition.
E95-1032.txt,3,Dalrymple_comma_ Shieber and Pereira 1991 henceforth_comma_ DSP give an equational treatment of ellipsis via higher order unification which_comma_ amongst other things_comma_ provides an insightful analysis of the interactions between ellipsis and quantification.
E95-1032.txt,4,But it suffers a number of drawbacks_comma_ especially when viewed from a computational perspective.
E95-1032.txt,5,First_comma_ the precise order in which quantifiers are scoped and ellipses resolved determines the final interpretation of elliptical sentences.
E95-1032.txt,6,It is hard to see how DSP s analysis could be implemented within a system employing a pipelined architecture that_comma_ say_comma_ separates quantifier scoping out from other reference resolution operations this would seem to preclude the generation of some legitimate readings.
E95-1032.txt,7,Yet many systems_comma_ for good practical reasons_comma_ employ this kind of architecture.
E95-1032.txt,8,Second_comma_ without additional constraints_comma_ DSP slightly overgenerate readings for sentences like 1 3ohn revised his paper before the teacher did_comma_ and so did Bill.
E95-1032.txt,9,Kehler 1993a has convincingly argued that this problem arises because DSP do not distinguish between merely co referential and co indexed in his terminology_comma_ role linked expressions.
E95-1032.txt,10,Third_comma_ though perhaps less importantly_comma_ higherorder unification going beyond second order matching is required for resolving ellipses involving quarttification.
E95-1032.txt,11,This increases the computational complexity of the ellipsis resolution task.
E95-1032.txt,12,This paper presents a treatment of ellipsis which avoids these difficulties_comma_ while having essentially the same coverage as DSP.
E95-1032.txt,13,The treatment is easily implementable_comma_ and forms the basis of the ellipsis resolution component currently used within the Core Language Engine Alshawi et al._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1032.txt,14,Ellipsis interpretations are represented as simple sets of substitutions on semantic representations of the antecedent.
E95-1032.txt,15,The substitutions can be built up in an order independent way i.e. before_comma_ after or during scoping _comma_ and without recourse to higherorder unification.
E95-1032.txt,16,The treatment is similar to the discourse copying analysis of Kehler_comma_ 1993a _comma_ and to the substitutional treatment suggested by Kamp within Discourse Representation Theory_comma_ described in Gawron and Peters_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1032.txt,17,However_comma_ we extend the notion of strict and sloppy identity to deal with more than just pronouns.
E95-1032.txt,18,In doing so_comma_ we readily deal with phenomena like scope parallelism.
E95-1032.txt,19,While the treatment of ellipsis is hopefully of some value in its own right_comma_ a more general conclusion can be drawn concerning the requirements for a computational theory of semantics.
E95-1032.txt,20,Briefly_comma_ the standard view within formal semantics_comma_ which DSP inherit_comma_ identifies semantic interpretation with composition interpretation is the process of taking the meanings of various constituents and composing them together to form the meaning of the whole.
E95-1032.txt,21,This makes semantic interpretation a highly orderdependent affair e.g. the order in which a functor is composed with its arguments can substantially affect the resulting meaning.
E95-1032.txt,22,This is reflected in the order sensitive interleaving of scope and ellipsis resolution in DSP s account.
E95-1032.txt,23,In addition_comma_ composition is only sensitive to the meanings of its components.
E95-1032.txt,24,Typically there is a many one mapping from compositions onto meanings.
E95-1032.txt,25,So_comma_ for example_comma_ whether two terms with identical meanings are merely coreferential or are co indexed is the kind of information that may get lost the difference amounts to two ways of composing the same meaning.
E95-1032.txt,26,The alternative proposed here is to view seman229 tic interpretation as a process of building a possibly partial description of the intended semantic composition i.e. partial descriptions of what the meanings of various constituents are_comma_ and how they should be composed together While the order in which composition operations are performed can radically affect the outcome_comma_ the order in which descriptions are built up is unimportant.
E95-1032.txt,27,In the case of ellipsis_comma_ this extra layer of descriptive indirection permits an equational treatment of ellipsis that i is order independent_comma_ ii can take account compositional distinctions that do not result in meaning differences_comma_ and also iii does not require the use of higher order unification for dealing with quantitiers.
E95-1032.txt,28,The paper is organised as follows.
E95-1032.txt,29,Section 2 describes the substitutional treatment of ellipsis by way of a few examples presented in a simplified version of Quasi Logical Form QLF Alshawi and Crouch_comma_ 1992 Alshawi et el._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1032.txt,30,Section 3 gives the semantics for the notation_comma_ and argues that QLF is best understood as providing descriptions of semantic compositions.
E95-1032.txt,31,Section 4 raises some open questions concerning the determination of parallelism between ellipsis and antecedent_comma_ and other issues.
E95-1032.txt,32,Section 5 concludes.
E95-1032.txt,33,2 Ellipsis Substitutions This section illustrates the substitutional treatment of ellipsis through a small number of examples.
E95-1032.txt,34,For presentation purposes we only sketch the intended semantics of the simplified QLF notation used_comma_ and a more detailed discussion is deferred until section 3.

E95-1032.txt,37,The texan expression has four arguments an index_comma_ a determiner quantifier_comma_ an explicit restriction_comma_ and an additional contextually derived restriction.

E95-1032.txt,41,Again_comma_ prior to resolution this scope node would be an uniustantiated mete variable.

E95-1008.txt,1,language models are useful because they can provide probabilistic information upon uncertain decision making. The most common statistic is n grams measuring word cooccurrences in texts.
E95-1008.txt,2,The method suffers from data shortage problem_comma_ however.
E95-1008.txt,3,In this paper_comma_ we suggest Bayesian networks be used in approximating the statistics of insufficient occurrences and of those that do not occur in the sample texts with graceful degradation.
E95-1008.txt,4,Collocation map is a sigmoid belief network that can be constructed from bigrams.
E95-1008.txt,5,We compared the conditional probabilities and mutual information computed from bigrams and Collocation map.
E95-1008.txt,6,The results show that the variance of the values from Collocation map is smaller than that from frequency measure for the infrequent pairs by 48 .
E95-1008.txt,7,The predictive power of Collocation map for arbitrary associations not observed from sample texts is also demonstrated.
E95-1008.txt,9,In statistical language processing_comma_ n grams are bar sic to many probabilistic models including Hidden Markov models that work on the limited dependency of linguistic events.
E95-1008.txt,10,In this regard_comma_ Bayesian models Bayesian network_comma_ Belief network_comma_ Inference diagram to name a few are not very different from ItMMs.
E95-1008.txt,11,Bayesian models capture the conditional independence among probabilistic variables_comma_ and can compute the conditional distribution of the variables_comma_ which is known as a probabilistic inferencing.
E95-1008.txt,12,The pure n gram statistic_comma_ however_comma_ is somewhat crude in that it cannot do anything about unobserved events and its approximation on infrequent events can be unreliable.
E95-1008.txt,13,In this paper we show by way of extensive experiments that the Bayesian method that also can be composed from bigrams can overcome the data sparseness problem that is inherent in frequency counting methods.
E95-1008.txt,14,According to the empirical results_comma_ Collocation map that is a Bayesian model for lexical variables induced graceful approximation over unobserved and infrequent events.
E95-1008.txt,15,There are two known methods to deal with the data sparseness problem.
E95-1008.txt,16,They are smoothing and class based methods Dagan 1992 .
E95-1008.txt,17,Smoothing methods Church and Gale 1991 readjust the distribution of frequencies of word occurrences obtained from sample texts_comma_ and verify the distribution through held out texts.
E95-1008.txt,18,As Dagan 1992 pointed out_comma_ however_comma_ the values from the smoothing methods closely agree with the probability of a bigram consisting of two independent words.
E95-1008.txt,19,Class based methods Pereira et al. 1993 approximate the likelihood of unobserved words based on similar words.
E95-1008.txt,20,Dagan and et al. 1992 proposed a non hierarchical class based method.
E95-1008.txt,21,The two approaches report limited successes of purely experimental nature.
E95-1008.txt,22,This is so because they are based on strong assumptions.
E95-1008.txt,23,In the case of smoothing methods_comma_ frequency readjustment is somewhat arbitrary and will not be good for heavily dependent bigrams.
E95-1008.txt,24,As to the class based methods_comma_ the notion of similar words differs across different methods_comma_ and the association of probabilistic dependency with the similarity class of words is too strong to assume in generM.
E95-1008.txt,25,Collocation map that is first suggested in Itan 1993 is a sigmoid belief network with words as probabilistic variables.
E95-1008.txt,26,Sigmoid belief network is extensively studied by Neal 1992 _comma_ and has an efficient inferencing algorithm.
E95-1008.txt,27,Unlike other Bayesian models_comma_ the inferencing on sigmoid belief network is not NP hard_comma_ and inference methods by reducing the network and sampling are discussed in Han 1995 .
E95-1008.txt,28,Bayesian models constructed from local dependencies provide formal approximation among the variables_comma_ thus using Collocation map does not require strong assumption or intuition to justify the associations among words produced by the map.
E95-1008.txt,29,The results of inferencing on Collocation map are probabilities among any combinations of words represented in the map_comma_ which is not found 53 in other models.
E95-1008.txt,30,One significant shortcoming of Bayesian models lies in the heavy cost of inferencing.
E95-1008.txt,31,Our implementation of Collocation map includes 988 nodes_comma_ and takes 2 to 3 minutes to compute an association between words.
E95-1008.txt,32,The purpose of experiments is to find out how gracefully Collocation map deals with the unobserved cooccurrences in comparison with a naive bigram statistic.
E95-1008.txt,33,In the next section_comma_ Collocation map is reviewed following the definition in Flail 1993 .
E95-1008.txt,34,In section 3_comma_ mutual information and conditional probabilities computed using bigrams and Collocation map are compared.
E95-1008.txt,35,Section 4 concludes the paper by summarizing the good and bad points of the Collocation map and other methods.
E95-1008.txt,36,2 Collocation Map In this section_comma_ we make a brief .
E95-1004.txt,1,paper shows first the problems raised by proper names in natural language processing. Second_comma_ it introduces the knowledge representation structure we use based on conceptual graphs.
E95-1004.txt,2,Then it explains the techniques which are used to process known and unknown proper names.
E95-1004.txt,3,At last_comma_ it gives the performance of the system and the further works we intend to deal with. or unknown.
E95-1004.txt,4,Some of these techniques are taken out of existing systems but they have been unified and completed in constructing this single operational module.
E95-1004.txt,5,Besides some innovative techniques for desambiguating known proper names using the context have been implemented.
E95-1004.txt,6,2 Problems raised by proper names in NLP 1 .
E95-1004.txt,8,AFP_comma_ which covers the current economic life of the major industrialised countries_comma_ transmits on average 400 dispatches per day on this flow.
E95-1004.txt,9,Their content is drafted in French in a journalistic style.
E95-1004.txt,10,Using this flow_comma_ Exoseme feeds various users concerning precise and varied subjects_comma_ for example_comma_ rating announcements_comma_ company results_comma_ acquisitions_comma_ sectors of activity_comma_ observation of competition_comma_ partners or clients_comma_ etc. 50 such themes have currently been developed.
E95-1004.txt,11,They rely on precise filtering of dispatches with highlighting of sentences for fast reading.
E95-1004.txt,12,Exoseme is composed of several modules a morphological analyser_comma_ a proper name module_comma_ a syntactical analyser_comma_ a semantic analyser and a filtering module.
E95-1004.txt,13,The proper name module has two goals segmenting and categorising proper names.
E95-1004.txt,14,During the whole processing of a dispatch_comma_ the proper name module is involved in three different steps.
E95-1004.txt,15,First_comma_ it segments proper names during the morphological analysis.
E95-1004.txt,16,Second_comma_ it categorises proper names during the semantic analysis.
E95-1004.txt,17,Third_comma_ it is invoked by the filtering module to supply some more information needed for routing the dispatch.
E95-1004.txt,18,The proper name module is based on different techniques which are used to detect and categorise proper names depending on whether they are known In the AFP flow_comma_ proper names constitute a significant part of the text.
E95-1004.txt,19,They account for approximately one third of noun groups and half the words used in proper names do not belong to the French vocabulary e.g. family names_comma_ names of locations_comma_ foreign words .
E95-1004.txt,20,In addition_comma_ the number of words used in constructing proper names is potentially infinite.
E95-1004.txt,21,The first step of the processing is segmentation_comma_ i.e. accurate cutting up of proper names in the text the second step is categorisation_comma_ i.e. the attribution to each proper name of a conceptual category individual_comma_ company_comma_ location_comma_ etc. .
E95-1004.txt,22,It should be noted that segmentation and categorisation are processed differently depending on whether the proper name is known or unknown.
E95-1004.txt,23,2.1 Segmentation of proper names The segmentation of proper names enables the synctactical analyser to be relieved_comma_ particularly in the case of long proper names which contain grammatical markers e.g. prepositions_comma_ conjunctions_comma_ commas_comma_ full stops .
E95-1004.txt,25,For example_comma_ for Caisse de r6dit hgricole du Morbihan the analyser will provide two interpretations depending on whether Morbiha.n is attached to Cr6dit hgricole or to Caisse.
E95-1004.txt,26,Moreover_comma_ proper names often constitute agrammatical segments that sometimes confuse the synctactical analyser.
E95-1004.txt,27,For exam23 ple_comma_ in the sentence The director of Dollfus_comma_ Mieg and Cie has announced positive results_comma_ the analyser has difficulties in finding that The director is the subject of announce if it does not know the company Dollfus_comma_ Mieg and Cie.
E95-1004.txt,30,2.2 Categorisation of proper names Once the segmentation has been achieved_comma_ categorisation of proper names is necessary for the semantic analyse Categorisation maps proper names into a set of concepts e.g. human being_comma_ company_comma_ location .
E95-1004.txt,31,The very nature of proper names contributes widely to the understandin.g of texts.
E95-1004.txt,32,The semantic analyser must be able to use the various categories of proper names as semantic constraints which are complementary for the understanding of texts.
E95-1004.txt,33,For example_comma_ in the filtering theme of acquisitions_comma_ the sentence Express group intends to sell Le Point for 700 MF indicates a sale of interests in the newspaper Le Point.
E95-1004.txt,34,Whereas the following sentence_comma_ which is grammatically identical to the preceding one_comma_ Compagnie des Signaux intends to sell TVM430 for 700 MF indicates only a price for an industrial product.
E95-1004.txt,35,Categorisation of unknown proper names has already been studied as well.
E95-1004.txt,37,In our system_comma_ these ontological categories are extended to attributes needed by the semantic analyser or the filtering module.
E95-1004.txt,38,For instance_comma_ proper names may have different attributes such as city_comma_ rating agencies_comma_ sector of activity_comma_ market_comma_ financial indexes_comma_ etc. 3 Representation of proper names We will see that the proper name module requires a large amount of information concerning proper names_comma_ their forms_comma_ their categories_comma_ their attributes_comma_ the words of which they are composed_comma_ etc. This information must be able to be enriched in order to include additional processes_comma_ and accessible in order to be shared by several processes.
E95-1004.txt,40,It enables indispensable and heterogeneous data to be memorised and used in order to process proper names.
E95-1004.txt,41,For a given proper name_comma_ its category and its various attributes are directly represented in the form of a conceptual graph.
E95-1004.txt,42,For example_comma_ our knowledge base contains the graphs of Figure 1.
E95-1004.txt,43,This simple representation will be completed in the subsequent sections.
E95-1004.txt,44,We are going to show how each encountered problem uses the information of tile knowledge base and may add its own information to it.
E95-1004.txt,45,The final result is a large knowledge base including 8_comma_000 proper names sharing 10_comma_000 fornas_comma_ based on 11_comma_000 words.
E95-1004.txt,46,There are also 90 attributes of proper names or words.
E95-1004.txt,47,Each new filtering theme may be a special case and its implementation may lead to introduce additional attributes into the knowledge base.
E95-1004.txt,48,The adopted representational formalism enables these additions to be made without leading to substantial modifications of its structure.
E95-1004.txt,49,4 Processing known proper names Firstly_comma_ we recognise the proper names in which we are directly interested in order to allocate to them attributes which are required for subsequent processes.
E95-1004.txt,50,We also seek to recognise the most frequent proper names e.g. country_comma_ cities_comma_ regions_comma_ statesmen in order to segment them and categorise them correctly.
E95-1004.txt,51,4.1 Immediate recognition The first idea which comes to mind is to memorise the proper names as they are encountered in the dispatches and to allocate to them the attributes.
E95-1004.txt,52,All this information is stored in the knowledge base which contains_comma_ for example  New   York  PN location  Soci4t4  G4n4rale  PN bank  Standard  and  Poor s   PN rating agency The knowledge base is thus structured on the model showed in Figure 2.
E95-1004.txt,53,And subsequently_comma_ recognition of the proper name in the text occurs through simple pattern matching.
E95-1004.txt,55,Equivalent words are expressed in the knowledge base through a relationship.
E95-1004.txt,56,For example_comma_ our base contains the graph of Figure 3.
E95-1004.txt,57,4.3 Synonymous proper names However_comma_ one can use very different proper names to designate a given reality.
E95-1004.txt,58,For example_comma_ we can find simple synonyms such as Hexagone for France or Rue d Antin for Paribas.
E95-1004.txt,60,Dispatches also contain more or less complex transformations_comma_ that it can be difficult to derive from the standard form_comma_ such as NewYork and NY for New York_comma_ or indeed SetP and S Poors for Standard and Poor s.
E95-1004.txt,61,Once again_comma_ in order to avoid listing pointlessly the attributes for all the necessary proper names_comma_ the forms of synonymous proper names are grouped around a single reference to which the various attributes are allocated.
E95-1004.txt,62,This grouping enables the various .
E95-1005.txt,1,argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in semantic accounts of coordination is instead appropriately handled in terms of structure sharing in LFG f structures. We provide an extension to the previous account of LFG semantics Dalrymple et al._comma_ 1993a according to which dependencies between f structures are viewed as resources as a result a one to one correspondence between uses of f structures and meanings is maintained.
E95-1005.txt,2,The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate the very property of resourcesensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation.
E95-1005.txt,4,The resource based approach to semantic composition in Lexical Functional Grammar LFG obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction_comma_ beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises Dalrymple et al._comma_ 1993a .
E95-1005.txt,5,The resource sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f structures.
E95-1005.txt,6,The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once_comma_ allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f structures Kaplan and Bresnan_comma_ 1982_comma_ pages 211 212 to be maintained.
E95-1005.txt,7,However. there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance.
E95-1005.txt,8,This is most kehl er das_comma_ harvard_comma_ edu t dalrymple_comma_ i amping_comma_ saraswat parc. xerox_comma_ tom obvious in_comma_ but is not limited to_comma_ sentences involving coordination.

E95-1005.txt,10,NAFTA is the object of two different verbs 1 Bill supported_comma_ and Hillary opposed_comma_ NAFTA.
E95-1005.txt,11,Since the hallmark of the linear logic approach is to ensure that f structure contributions are ulilized exactly once in a derivation_comma_ such constructions would at first glance appear to be problematic for the approach.
E95-1005.txt,12,We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in the treatment of coordination in other approaches is appropriately handled by exploiting the structure sharing in LF _comma_ f structures. We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f structure. Dalrymple et al. 199aa provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas.
E95-1005.txt,13,These formulas manipulate basic assertions of the form f _comma_r . M_comma_ for f structures f and meaning logzc terms M.
E95-1005.txt,14,Here r is a mapping_comma_ the semantic projectign_comma_ that relates f structures to semantic structures. To distinguish between multiple paths entering an f structure_comma_ we now take cr to map from sets of paths in f structures to semantic structures. Further_comma_ the paths between f structures are made available in the semantic space as resources. This makes it possible for the semantic formulas to exploit information about the multiple paths into an f structure in order to account for the multiple uses of the f structure s semantic contribution. The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate the very property of resource sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation. In Section 2_comma_ we review previous approaches to the semantics of coordination and argument shar31 ing. and make note of some of their drawbacks. We describe the revised sere.antic framework in Section 3. and work through several examples of non constituent coordination specifically_comma_ rightnode raising in Section 4.
E95-1005.txt,15,We discnss examples involving intensioual verbs in Section 5_comma_ 2 Previous Work 2.1 Combinatory Categorial Grammar Steedman 198.5 1989 1990 _comma_ working in the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar CCG _comma_ presents what is probably the most adequate analysis of non constituent coordination to date.
E95-1005.txt,16,As noted by Steedman and discussed by Oehrle 1990 _comma_ the addition of the rule of function composition to the inventory of syntactic rules in Categorial Grammar enables the formation of constituents with right peripheral gaps_comma_ providing a basis for a clean treatment of cases of right node raising as exemplified by sentence 1 .
E95-1005.txt,17,Such examples are handled by a coordination schema which allows like categories to be conjoined_comma_ shown in 2 .
E95-1005.txt,18,2 Coordination X CONJ X . X This schema gives rise to various actual rules whose semantics depends on the number of arguments that the shared material takes.
E95-1005.txt,19,For the cases of RNR considered here_comma_ the rule has the form shown in 3 .
E95-1005.txt,20,3 coordination X Y F CON J X Y G X Y Ax. Fx Gx The contraction from x.Fx and Ax.Gx to x. Fx Gx in this rule allows for the single argument to be utilized twice.
E95-1005.txt,21,As noted by Hudson 1976 _comma_ however_comma_ not all examples of RNR involve coordinate structures 4 Citizens who support_comma_ paraded against politicians who oppose_comma_ two trade bills.
E95-1005.txt,22,Obviously_comma_ such cases fall outside of the purview of the coordination schema.
E95-1005.txt,23,An analysis for this sentence is avi ilable in the CCG framework by the addition of the xsubstitute combinator Steedman_comma_ p.c. _comma_ as defined in Steedman 1987 .
E95-1005.txt,25,While this approach has some drawbacks_comma_ 1 we do not offer a competing analysis of the syntax of sentences like 4 here.
E95-1005.txt,26,Rather_comma_ we seek an analysis of RNR and of resource sharing in general that is uniform in the semantics such a treatment isn t available in CCG because of its tight integration between syntax and semantics.
E95-1005.txt,27,2.2 Partee and Rooth Perhaps the most influential and widely adopted semantic treatment of coordination is the approach of Partee and Rooth 1983 .
E95-1005.txt,28,They propose a generalized conjunction scheme in which conjuncts of the same type can be combined...ks is the case with Steedman s operators_comma_ contraction inherent in the schema allows for a single shared argument to be distributed as an argument of each conjunct.
E95-1005.txt,29,Type lifting is allowed to produce like types when necessary the combination of the coordination scheme and type lifting can have the effect of copying an argument of higher type_comma_ such as a quantifier in the case of coordinated intensional verbs.
E95-1005.txt,30,They propose a processing strategy requiring that expressions are interpreted a the lowest possible type_comma_ with type raising taking place only where necessary.
E95-1005.txt,32,Partee and Rooth assume that extensional verbs such as find are entered in the lexicon with basic type e_comma_ e_comma_ t _comma_ whereas intensional verbs like want_comma_ which require a quantifier as an argument_comma_ have type e_comma_ t _comma_ t _comma_ e_comma_ t ignoring intensionality .
E95-1005.txt,34,When an intensional and an extensional verb are coordinated_comma_ the extensional verb must be 1We find two problems with the approach as it stands.
E95-1005.txt,35,First_comma_ the intuition that one gap is parasitic upon the other in cases like 4 is not strong_comma_ whereas the CCG analysis suggests an asymmetry between the two gaps.
E95-1005.txt,36,Second_comma_ the combinator appears to cause overgeneration.
E95-1005.txt,37,While it allows sentence 4 _comma_ it also allows sentence b _comma_ where two trade bills is analyzed as the object of both verbs b Politicians who oppose_comma_ paraded against_comma_ two trade bills.
E95-1005.txt,39,However_comma_ an unwelcome consequence of this approach_comma_ which appears to have gone unnoticed in the literature_comma_ arises in cases in which more than two verbs are conjoined.
E95-1005.txt,40,If an intensional verb is coordinated with more than one extensional verb_comma_ a copy of the quantifier will be distributed to each verb in the coordinate structure.
E95-1005.txt,41,For instance_comma_ in 9 _comma_ two extensional verbs and an intensional verb are coordinated.
E95-1005.txt,43,This is the wrong result in a sentence such as Hillary wanted_comma_ found_comma_ and supported two candidates_comma_ the desired result is where one quantifier scopes over both extensional verbs that is_comma_ Hillary found and supported the same two candidates _comma_ just as in the case where all the verbs are extensional.
E95-1005.txt,44,Further_comma_ there does not seem to be an obvious way to modify the Partee and Rooth proposal so as to produce the correct result_comma_ the problem being that the ability to copy quantifiers inherent in their schema is too unrestricted.
E95-1005.txt,45,A second problem with the account is that_comma_ as with Steedman s coordination schema_comma_ Partee and Rooth s type raising strategy only applies to coordinate structures.
E95-1005.txt,46,However_comma_ the need to type raise extends to cases not involving coordination_comma_ as in sentence 10 .
E95-1005.txt,47,10 Citizens who seek_comma_ paraded against politicians who have_comma_ a decent health insurance policy.
E95-1005.txt,48,We will present an analysis that preserves the intuition underlying Partee and Rooth s processing strategy_comma_ but that predicts and generates the correct reading for cases such as 9 .
E95-1005.txt,49,Furthermore_comma_ the account applies equally to examples not involving coordination_comma_ as is the case in sentence 10 .
E95-1005.txt,50,3 LFG and Linear Logic LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation constituent structure c structure 2 encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations_comma_ and functional structure f structure encodes syntactic predicate argument structure.
E95-1005.txt,51,The f structure for sentence 11 is given in 12 11 Bill supported NAFTA.
E95-1005.txt,53,fOBJ  ro f supported Bill_comma_ Y Similarly_comma_ using the meaning of NAFTA_comma_ Rrelation ii _comma_ and Axiom I_comma_ we can derive the meaning shown in 17 17 f OBJ o .. NAFTA and combine it with 16 to derive 18 18 fo  supported Bill_comma_ NAFTA At each step_comma_ universal instantiation and modus ponens are used.
E95-1005.txt,54,A second derivation is also possible_comma_ in which supported and NAFTA are combined first and the result is then combined with Bill.
E95-1005.txt,55,The use of linear logic provides a flexible mechanism for deducing meanings of sentences based on their f structure representations.
E95-1005.txt,56,Accounts of 34 various linguistic phenomena have been developed within the framework on which our extension is based_comma_ including quantifiers and anaphora Dalrymple et al._comma_ 1994a _comma_ intensional verbs Dalrympie et al._comma_ 1994b _comma_ and complex predicates Dalrymple et al._comma_ 993b .
E95-1005.txt,57,The logic fits well with the resource sensitivity of natural language semantics there is a one to one correspondence between f structure relationships and meanings the multiple use of resources arises from multiple paths to them in the f structure.
E95-1005.txt,58,In the next section_comma_ we show how this system applies to several cases of right node raising.
E95-1005.txt,59,4 Examples 4.1 RNR with Coordination First we consider the derivation of the basic case of right node raising RN R illustrated in sentence i _comma_ repeated in 19 .
E95-1005.txt,60,19 Bill supported_comma_ and Hillary opposed_comma_ NAFTA.

E95-1005.txt,67,This requires that the quantified NP meaning be duplicated_comma_ since otherwise no readings result.
E95-1005.txt,70,This strategy predicts the readings generated for the examples in Section 4.
E95-1005.txt,71,It also predicts the desired reading for sentence 23 _comma_ since that reading requires two quantifiers.
E95-1005.txt,72,While the reading generated by Partee and Rooth is derivable_comma_ it requires three quantifiers and thus uses QNP duplication twice_comma_ which is less preferred than the reading requiring two quantifiers which uses QNP duplication once.
E95-1005.txt,73,Also_comma_ it allows some flexibility in cases where pragmatics strongly suggests that quantitiers are copied and distributed for multiple extensional verbs unlike the Partee and Rooth account_comma_ this would apply equally to the case where there are also intensional verbs and the case where there are not.
E95-1005.txt,74,Finally_comma_ our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example 10 _comma_ since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing.
E95-1005.txt,75,37 6 Conclusions and Future Work We have given an account of resource sharing in the syntax semantics interface of LFG.
E95-1005.txt,76,The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f structures as resources in this way the one to one correspondence between f structure relations and meanings is maintained.
E95-1005.txt,77,The resulting account does not suffer from overgeneration inherent in other approaches_comma_ and applies equally to cases of resource sharing that do not involve coordination.
E95-1005.txt,78,Furthermore_comma_ it lends itself readily to an extension for the intensional verb case that has advantages over the widely assumed account of Partee and Rooth 1983 .
E95-1005.txt,79,Here we have separated the issue of arriving at the appropriate f structure in the syntax from the issue of deriving the correct semantics from the f structure.
E95-1005.txt,80,We have argued that this is the correct distinction to make_comma_ and have given a treatment of the second issue.
E95-1005.txt,81,A treatment of the first issue will be articulated in a future forum.

E95-1011.txt,1,Shanker and Weir 1993 show that Linear Indexed Grammars I_IG can be processed in polynomial time by exploiting constraints which make possible the extensive use of structure sharing. This paper describes a formalism that is more powerful than I_IG_comma_ but which can also be processed in polynomial time using similar techniques.
E95-1011.txt,2,The formalism_comma_ which we refer to as Partially Linear PATR PI_PATR manipulates feature structures rather than stacks.
E95-1011.txt,4,Unification based grammar formalisms can be viewed as generalizations of Context Free Grammars CFG where the nonterminal symbols are replaced by an infinite domain of feature structures.
E95-1011.txt,5,Much of their popularity stems from the way in which syntactic generalization may be elegantly stated by means of constraints amongst features and their values.
E95-1011.txt,6,Unfortunately_comma_ the expressivity of these formalisms can have undesirable consequences for their processing.
E95-1011.txt,7,In naive implementations of unification grammar parsers_comma_ feature structures play the same role as nonterminals in standard context free grammar parsers.
E95-1011.txt,8,Potentially large feature structures are stored at intermediate steps in the computation_comma_ so that the space requirements of the algorithm are expensive.
E95-1011.txt,9,Furthermore_comma_ the need to perform nondestructive unification means that a large proportion of the processing time is spent copying feature structures.
E95-1011.txt,10,One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions_comma_ structure sharing_comma_ and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures Shieber_comma_ 1985 Pereira_comma_ 1985 Karttunen and Kay_comma_ 1985 Wroblewski_comma_ 1987 Gerdemann_comma_ 1989 Godden_comma_ 1990 Kogure_comma_ 1990 Emele_comma_ 1991 Tomabechi_comma_ 1991 Harrison and Ellison_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1011.txt,11,While these techniques can yield significant improvements in performance_comma_ the generality of unification based grammar formalisms means that there are still cases where expensive processing is unavoidable.
E95-1011.txt,12,This approach does not address the fundamental issue of the tradeoff between the descriptive capacity of a formalism and its computational power.
E95-1011.txt,13,In this paper we identify a set of constraints that can be placed on unification based grammar formalisms in order to guarantee the existence of polynomial time parsing algorithms.
E95-1011.txt,14,Our choice of constraints is motivated by showing how they generalize constraints inherent in Linear Indexed Grammar l_lG .
E95-1011.txt,15,We begin by describing how constraints inherent in I.IG admit tractable processing algorithms and then consider how these constraints can be generalized to a formalism that manipulates trees rather than stacks.
E95-1011.txt,16,The constraints that we identify for the tree based system can be regarded equally well as constraints on unification based grammar formalisms such as PArR Shieber_comma_ 1984 .
E95-1011.txt,17,2 From Stacks to Trees An Indexed Grammar IG can be viewed as a CFG in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack of indices.
E95-1011.txt,18,Productions specify not only how nonterminals can be rewritten but also how their associated stacks are modified.
E95-1011.txt,19,1_16_comma_ which were first described by Gazdar 1988 _comma_ are constrained such that stacks are passed from the mother to at most a single daughter.
E95-1011.txt,20,For I_IG_comma_ the size of the domain of nonterminals and associated stacks the analogue of the nonterminals in CFG is not bound by the grammar.
E95-1011.txt,21,However_comma_ Vijay Shanker and Weir 1993 demonstrate that polynomial time performance 75 can be achieved through the use of structuresharing made possible by constraints in the way that LI6 use stacks.
E95-1011.txt,22,Although stacks of unbounded size can arise during a derivation_comma_ it is not possible for a LIG to specify that two dependent_comma_ unbounded stacks must appear at distinct places in the derivation tree.
E95-1011.txt,23,Structure sharing can therefore be used effectively because checking the applicability of rules at each step in the derivation involves the comparison of structures of limited size.
E95-1011.txt,24,Our goal is to generalize the constraints inherent in LIG to a formalism that manipulates feature structures rather than stacks.
E95-1011.txt,25,As a guidl ing heuristic we will avoid formalisms that generate tree sets with an unbounded number of unbounded_comma_ dependent branches.
E95-1011.txt,26,It appears that the structure sharing techniques used with LIG cannot be generalized in a straightforward way to such formalisms.
E95-1011.txt,27,Suppose that we generalize LIG to allow the stack to be passed from the mother to two daughters.
E95-1011.txt,28,If this is done recursion can be used to produce an unbounded number of unbounded_comma_ dependent branches.
E95-1011.txt,29,An alternative is to allow an unbounded stack to be shared between two or more daughters but not with the mother.
E95-1011.txt,30,Thus_comma_ rules may mention more than one unbounded stack_comma_ but the stack associated with the mother is still associated with at most one daughter.
E95-1011.txt,31,We refer to this extension as Partially Linear Indexed Grammars PLIG .
E95-1011.txt,32,Example 1 The PLIG with the following productions generates the language anbmcnd m In_comma_ m 1 and the tree set shown in Figure 1.
E95-1011.txt,33,Because a single PUG production may mention more than one unbounded stack_comma_ variables x_comma_ y are introduced to distinguish between them.
E95-1011.txt,38,Example 3 PLIG can count to any fixed k_comma_ i.e._comma_ a PLIG with the following productions generates the language a ...a n In O where k 1.
E95-1011.txt,40,In PLIG_comma_ stacks shared amongst siblings cannot be passed to the mother.
E95-1011.txt,41,As a consequence_comma_ there is no possibility that recursion can be used to increase the number of dependent branches.
E95-1011.txt,42,In fact_comma_ the number of dependent branches is bounded by the length of the right hand side of productions.
E95-1011.txt,44,Note that the tree shown in Figure 2 is unobtainable because the branch rooted at 7 1 is dependent on more than one of the branches originating at its sibling r 2.
E95-1011.txt,45,This limitation can be overcome by moving to a formalism that manipulates trees rather than stacks.
E95-1011.txt,46,We consider an extension of CFG in which each nonterminal A is associated with a tree r.
E95-1011.txt,47,Productions now specify how the tree associated with the mother is related to the trees associated with the daughters.
E95-1011.txt,48,We denote trees with first order terms.
E95-1011.txt,49,For example_comma_ the following production requires that the x and y subtrees of the mother s tree are shared with the B and C daughters_comma_ respectively.
E95-1011.txt,50,In addition_comma_ the daughters have in common the subtree z.
E95-1011.txt,53,However_comma_ we do not impose this restriction because it still leaves open the possibility of generating trees in which every branch has the same length_comma_ thus violating the condition that trees have at most a bounded number of unbounded_comma_ dependent branches.
E95-1011.txt,54,Figure 4 shows how a set of such trees can be generated by illustrating the effect of the following production.
E95-1011.txt,56,Passing the right subtrees x_comma_ y_comma_ z and I to the mother as shown allows the construction of a full binary tree with height i 1 ri l .
E95-1011.txt,57,This can be repeated an 1There will be a set of such productions for each tape symbol W.
E95-1011.txt,58,77 A f Ti l 0.
E95-1011.txt,62,V V V V A 0.
E95-1011.txt,66,To overcome both of these problems we impose the following additional constraint on the productions of a grammar.
E95-1011.txt,67,We require that subtrees of the mother that are passed to daughters that share subtrees with one another must appear as siblings in the mother s tree.
E95-1011.txt,68,Note that this condition rules out the production responsible for building full binary trees since the x_comma_ y_comma_ x and y subtrees are not siblings in the mother s tree despite the fact that all of the daughters share a common subtree z.
E95-1011.txt,69,Moreover_comma_ since a daughter shares subtrees with itself_comma_ a special case of the condition is that subtrees occurring within some daughter can only appear as siblings in the mother.
E95-1011.txt,70,This condition also rules out the Turing Machine simulation.
E95-1011.txt,71,We refer to this formalism as Partially Linear Tree Grammars PLTG .
E95-1011.txt,72,As a further illustration of the constraints places on shared subtrees_comma_ Figure 5 shows a local tree that could appear in a derivation tree.
E95-1011.txt,73,This local tree is licensed by the following production which respects all of the constraints on PLT6 productions.
E95-1011.txt,75,Example 4 The PLTG with the following productions generates the language a b c In _ 1 and the tree set shown in Figure 2.
E95-1011.txt,78,3 Trees to Feature Structures Finally_comma_ we note that acyclic feature structures without re entrancy can be viewed as trees with branches labelled by feature names and atomic values only found at leaf nodes interior nodes 78 being unlabelled .
E95-1011.txt,79,Based on this observation_comma_ we can consider the constraints we have formulated for the tree system PI_TG as constraints on a unification based grammar formalism such as PARR.
E95-1011.txt,80,We will call this system Partially Linear PATR PI_PATR .
E95-1011.txt,81,Having made the move from trees to feature structures_comma_ we consider the possibility of re entrancy in PI_PATR.
E95-1011.txt,82,Note that the feature structure at the root of a PI_PATR derivation tree will not involve reentrancy.
E95-1011.txt,83,However_comma_ for the following reasons we believe that this does not constitute as great a limitation as it might appear.
E95-1011.txt,84,In unification based grammar_comma_ the feature structure associated with the root of the tree is often regarded as the structure that has been derived from the input i.e._comma_ the output of a parser .
E95-1011.txt,85,As a consequence there is a tendency to use the grammar rules to accumulate a single_comma_ large feature structure giving a complete encoding of the analysis.
E95-1011.txt,86,To do this_comma_ unbounded feature information is passed up the tree in a way that violates the constraints developed in this paper.
E95-1011.txt,87,Rather than giving such prominenc.e to the root feature structure_comma_ we suggest that the entire derivation tree should be seen as the object that is derived from the input_comma_ i.e._comma_ this is what the parser returns.
E95-1011.txt,88,Because feature structures associated with all nodes in the tree are available_comma_ feature information need only be passed up the tree when it is required in order to establish dependencies within the derivation tree.
E95-1011.txt,89,When this approach is taken_comma_ there may be less need for reentrancy in the root feature structure.
E95-1011.txt,90,Furthermore_comma_ re entrancy in the form of shared feature structures within and across nodes will be found in PI_PATR see for example Figure 5 .
E95-1011.txt,91,4 Generative Capacity HG are more powerful than CI G and are known to be weakly equivalent to Tree Adjoining Grammar_comma_ Combinatory Categorial Grammar_comma_ and Head Grammar Vijay Shanker and Weir_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1011.txt,92,PI_IG are more powerful than I_IG since they can generate the k copy language for any fixed k see Example 2 .
E95-1011.txt,94,We believe that the language involving copies of strings of matching brackets described in Example 5 cannot be generated by PI_IG but_comma_ as shown in Exampie 5_comma_ it can be generated by P T and therefore PLPATR. Slightly more generally_comma_ PLTG can generate the language w k Iw L for any k 1 and context free language L. It appears that the class of languages generated by PI_TG is included in those languages generated by Linear Context Free Rewriting Systems VijayShanker et al._comma_ 1987 since the construction involved in a proof of this underlies the recognition algorithm discussed in the next section.
E95-1011.txt,95,As is the case for the tree sets of 16_comma_ 1_16 and Tree Adjoining Grammar_comma_ the tree sets generated by PI_TG have path sets that. are context free languages.
E95-1011.txt,96,In other words_comma_ the set of all strings labelling root to frontier paths of derivation trees is a context free language.
E95-1011.txt,97,While the tree sets of lAG and Tree Adjoining Grammars have independent branches_comma_ PI_T6 tree sets exhibit dependent branches_comma_ where the number of dependent branches in any tree is bounded by the grammar.
E95-1011.txt,98,Note that the number of dependent branches in the tree sets of 16 is not bounded by the grammar e.g._comma_ they generate sets of all full binary trees .
E95-1011.txt,99,5 Tractable Recognition In this section we outline the main ideas underlying a polynomial time recognition algorithm for PlPATR that generalizes the CKY algorithm Kasami_comma_ 1965 Younger_comma_ 1967 .
E95-1011.txt,100,The key to this algorithm is the use of structure sharing techniques similar to those used to process I_lG efficiently Vijay Shanker and Weir_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1011.txt,101,To understand how these techniques are applied in the case of PLPATR_comma_ it is therefore helpful to consider first the somewhat simpler case of I_lG.
E95-1011.txt,102,The CKY algorithm is a bottom up recognition algorithm for CI G.
E95-1011.txt,104,A naive adaptation of this algorithm for I_lG recognition would involve storing a set of nonterminals and their associated stacks.
E95-1011.txt,105,But since stack length is at least proportional to the length of the input string_comma_ the resultant algorithm would exhibit exponential space and time complexity in the worst case.
E95-1011.txt,106,Vijay Shanker and Weir 1993 showed that the behaviour of the naive algorithm can be improved upon.
E95-1011.txt,107,In I_lG derivations the application of a rule cannot depend on more than a bounded portion of the top of the stack.
E95-1011.txt,109,Consider Figure 6.
E95-1011.txt,113,It is not difficult to show that only that portion of the derivation below the terminator node is dependent on more than the top of the stack ha.
E95-1011.txt,115,This captures the sense in which I_IG derivations exhibit context freeness .
E95-1011.txt,117,2The stack aa associated with B is inherited from the stack associated with A at the root of the tree.
E95-1011.txt,118,Before describing how we adapt this technique to the case of PLPATR we discuss the sense in which PLPATR derivations exhibit a contextfreeness property.
E95-1011.txt,119,The constraints on PLPATR which we have identified in this paper ensure that these feature values can be manipulated independently of one another and that they behave in a stack like way.
E95-1011.txt,120,As a consequence_comma_ the storage technique used effectively for LIG recognition may be generalized to the case of PLPATR.
E95-1011.txt,121,Suppose that we have the derived tree shown in Figure 7 where the nodes at the root of the subtrees T1 and 7 2 are the so called f terminator and g terminator of the tree s root_comma_ respectively.
E95-1011.txt,125,The context freeness of PI_PATR means that given the three trees shown in Figures 7 and 8 the tree shown in Figure 9 will also be generated by the grammar.
E95-1011.txt,126,This gives us a means of efficiently storing the potentially unbounded feature structures associated with nodes in a derivation tree derived feature structures .
E95-1011.txt,128,For each feature_comma_ we store in the recognition array a bounded amount of information about its value locally_comma_ together with a pointer to a further array element.
E95-1011.txt,129,Entries in this element of the recognition array that are compatible i.e. unifiable with the bounded_comma_ local information correspond to different possible values for the feature.
E95-1011.txt,130,For example_comma_ we can use a single entry in the recognition array to store the fact that all of the feature structures that can appear at the root of the trees in Figure 9 derive the substring ai...aj.
E95-1009.txt,1,groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a linguistic atlas. The first step in the analysis_comma_ the computation of linguistic distance.between each pair of sites_comma_ can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings.
E95-1009.txt,2,This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses_comma_ and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match.
E95-1009.txt,3,In the actual clustering step_comma_ traditional agglomerative clustering works better thaxl the top down technique of partitioning around medoids.
E95-1009.txt,4,When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic_comma_ reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained_comma_ corresponding to national and within Ireland provincial boundaries.
E95-1009.txt,6,Defining dialects is one of the first tasks that linguists need to pursue when approaching a language.
E95-1009.txt,7,Knowing the dialect areas helps one allocate resources in language research and has implications for language learners_comma_ publishers_comma_ broadcasters_comma_ educators_comma_ and language planners.
E95-1009.txt,8,Unfortunately_comma_ dialect definition can be a timeconsuming and ill defined process.
E95-1009.txt,9,The traditional approach has been to plot isoglosses_comma_ delineating regions where the same word is used for the same concept_comma_ or perhaps the same pronunciation for the same phoneme.
E95-1009.txt,10,But isoglosses are frustrating.
E95-1009.txt,11,The first problem_comma_ as Gaston Paris noted apud Durand_comma_ 1889 49 _comma_ is that isoglosses rarely coincide.
E95-1009.txt,12,At best_comma_ isoglosses for different features approach each other_comma_ forming vague bundles at I thank Martin Kay_comma_ Paul Kiparsky_comma_ Tom Wasow_comma_ and a reviewer for helpful comments. worst_comma_ isoglosses may cut across each other_comma_ describing completely contradictory binary divisions of the dialect area.
E95-1009.txt,13,That is_comma_ language may vary geographically in many dimensions_comma_ but the requirements we usually impose require that a specific site be placed in a unique dialect.
E95-1009.txt,14,Traditional dialectological methodology gives little guidance as to how to perform such reduction to one dimension.
E95-1009.txt,15,A second problem is that many isoglosses do not neatly bisect the language area.
E95-1009.txt,16,Often variants do not neatly line up on two sides of a line_comma_ but are intermixed haphazardly.
E95-1009.txt,17,More importantly_comma_ for some sites information may be lacking_comma_ or the question is simply not applicable.
E95-1009.txt,18,When comparing how various sites pronounce the first consonant of a particular word_comma_ it is meaningless to ask that question if the site does not use that word.
E95-1009.txt,19,So the isogloss is incomplete and cannot be meaningfully compared with isoglosses based on different sets of sites.
E95-1009.txt,20,The third problem is that most languages have dialect continua_comma_ such that the speech of one community differs little from the speech of its neighbouts.
E95-1009.txt,21,Even though the cumulative effects of such differences may be great when one considers the ends of the continua such as southern Italian versus northern French _comma_ still it seems arbitrary to draw major dialect boundaries between two villages with very similar speech patterns.
E95-1009.txt,22,Such conundrums led Paris and others to conclude that the dialect boundary_comma_ and therefore the very notion of dialect_comma_ is an ill defined concept.
E95-1009.txt,23,More recently_comma_ the field of dialectometry_comma_ as introduced by S guy 1971_comma_ 1973 _comma_ has addressed these issues by developing several techniques for summarizing and presenting variation along multiple dimensions.
E95-1009.txt,24,They replace isoglosses with a distance matrix_comma_ which compares each site directly with all other sites_comma_ ultimately yielding a single figure that measures the linguistic distances between each pair of sites.
E95-1009.txt,25,There is however no firm agreement on just how to compute the distance matrices.
E95-1009.txt,26,Sfiguy s earliest work 1971 was based on lexical correspondences sites differed in the extent to which they used different words for the 60 same concept.
E95-1009.txt,27,S guy 1973 _comma_ Philps 1987 _comma_ and Durand 1989 use some combination of lexical_comma_ phonological_comma_ and morphological data.
E95-1009.txt,28,Babitch 1988 described the dialectal distances in Acadian villages by the degree to which their fishing terminology varied.
E95-1009.txt,29,Babitch and Lebrun 1989 did a similar analysis based on the varying pronunciation of r .
E95-1009.txt,30,Elsie 1986 grouped the Gaelic dialects on the basis of whether the vocabulary matched.
E95-1009.txt,31,Ebobisse 1989 grouped the Sawabantu languages of Cameroon by whether phonological correspondences in matching vocabulary items were complete_comma_ partial_comma_ or lacking.
E95-1009.txt,32,There seems to be a certain bias in favour of working with lexical correspondences_comma_ which is understandable_comma_ since deciding whether two sites use the same word for the same concept is perhaps one of the easiest linguistic judgements to make.
E95-1009.txt,33,The need to figure out such systems as the comparative phonology of various linguistic sites can be very time consuming and fraught with arbitrary choices.
E95-1009.txt,34,Not all dialectometrists agree on the wisdom of delineating dialect areas.
E95-1009.txt,35,Sdguy 1973 18 insisted that the concept of dialect boundaries was meaningless_comma_ and his emphasis on the gradience of language similarity has been widely maintained.
E95-1009.txt,36,Bu t those who do look for firna dialect affiliations such as Babitch and Ebobisse use bottom up agglomerative techniques.
E95-1009.txt,37,The two linguistically closest sites are grouped into one dialect_comma_ and thenceforth treated as a unit.
E95-1009.txt,38,The process continues recursively until all sites are grouped into one superdialect embracing the entire language area under consideration.
E95-1009.txt,39,This yields a binary tree.
E95-1009.txt,40,But Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990 44 suggest that when the emphasis in a clustering problem is on the top level clusters here_comma_ finding the two main dialects then such bottom up methods_comma_ which can potentially introduce error at each of several steps_comma_ are less reliable than top down partitioning methods.
E95-1009.txt,41,Perhaps past researchers have used inferior bottom up techniques simply because the necessary algorithms are computationally more tractable.
E95-1009.txt,42,Comparing all possible pairs of sites is a O N 2 problem_comma_ 1 whereas considering all possible two way partitions of tile dialect area is 0 2 N .
E95-1009.txt,43,The current state of dialectometry thus presents two main questions which constitute the methodological focus of this paper.
E95-1009.txt,44,The first deals with distance matrices.
E95-1009.txt,45,Is there a way to build accurate distance matrices that minimize editorial decisions without discarding relevant data
E95-1009.txt,46,My research suggests that this may be done by using string distances computed directly on phonetic transcriptions_comma_ and that this is better than restricting the study to lexical comparisons.
E95-1009.txt,47,The second deals with clustering.
E95-1009.txt,48,Do bottom up or 1The overall algorithm is O N 3 since for each ue v group one must compute the distances between it and each of the other sites or groups. top down techniques work best
E95-1009.txt,49,My conclusion is that the traditional bottom up technique works better than a typical top down method.
E95-1009.txt,50,These conclusions are based partly on an analysis of the mathematical properties of the clusters themselves_comma_ partly on how well they correlate with analyses based on more traditional isogloss techniques_comma_ and partly on how well they compare with previously published descriptions of dialects in a specific language_comma_ Irish Gaelic.
E95-1009.txt,51,At one time the Gaelic languag group was spoken throughout Ireland_comma_ from where it spread to the Isle of Man and to much of Scotland.
E95-1009.txt,52,Currently fully native use of Gaelic is limited to a few discontiguous areas in the westernmost reaches of Ireland and Scotland.
E95-1009.txt,53,In the case of Ireland_comma_ everyone agrees that Gaelic is nowadays found in three main dialects that of Ulster_comma_ that of Connacht_comma_ and that of Munster 0 Siadhail_comma_ 1989 .
E95-1009.txt,54,But several questions are raised that are less easily answered.
E95-1009.txt,55,Do the three provinces separate out so neatly for intrinsic linguistic reasons_comma_ or simply because their speakers have become so widely separated from each other geographically as speakers in intervening areas have adopted English
E95-1009.txt,56,Does the language of Connacht naturally group with that of Ulster or with that of Munster
E95-1009.txt,57,And looking beyond Ireland_comma_ many have commented that the language of Ulster in general is similar to that of Scotland.
E95-1009.txt,58,Are Irish_comma_ Manx_comma_ and Scottish Gaelic considered three separate languages for intrinsic linguistic reasons_comma_ or because they are spoken in different countries
E95-1009.txt,59,To a large extent_comma_ dialectologists have found these questions difficult to answer because they accepted Paris s conundrum.
E95-1009.txt,60,For 6 Siadhail_comma_ the ultimate scientific justification ill adopting the three dialect account is the fact that the Gaeltacht Irish speaking territory is so fragmented nowadays that it no longer forms a continuum.
E95-1009.txt,61,O Cuiv 1951 4 49 felt that there can be no dialect boundaries because transitions are gradual.
E95-1009.txt,62,Elsie 1986 240 considers a dialect to be an area where all communities are linguistically more similar to each other than any community is to any site outside the dialect.
E95-1009.txt,63,Such notions provide a very firm_comma_ absolute notion of dialecthood a set of communities either constitutes a dialect area_comma_ or it does not.
E95-1009.txt,64,But as the dialectometrists have shown_comma_ other notions of clustering are equally scientific and may more accurately correspond to intuitive notions of what it means to be a dialect.
E95-1009.txt,65,2 Data The data for nay study were taken from Wagner 1958.
E95-1009.txt,66,Wagner administered a questionnaire to native speakers of Irish Gaelic in 86 sites.
E95-1009.txt,67,2 Most of the informants were over seventy years old and 2The atlas also maps for Kilkenny some information gathered from another source.
E95-1009.txt,68,61 had not spoken Irish since their youth_comma_ The atlas is therefore an approximate reconstruction of the linguistic landscape of the turn of the century_comma_ when the Gaeltacht was more continuous.
E95-1009.txt,69,Wagner also presents material from the Isle of Man and seven sites in Scotland.
E95-1009.txt,70,The mapped entries are presented in a very narrow phonetic transcription based on the International Phonetic Alphabet.
E95-1009.txt,71,Volume 1 of Wagner 1958 consists of 300 maps_comma_ plotting about 370 concepts.
E95-1009.txt,72,I used the first 51 concepts_comma_ or about 4500 different string tokens_comma_ as part of an ongoing project to enter all of the atlas into machine readable format.
E95-1009.txt,73,These 51 concepts were represented by 312 different Gaelic words or phrases_comma_ whose stems derived from 171 different etymons.
E95-1009.txt,74,3 Methodology and results 3.1 Distance matrices To form a baseline for comparison_comma_ I analysed the distribution of each of the 51 plotted concepts_comma_ finding a total of 3_comma_337 features by which two or more sites differed.
E95-1009.txt,75,For example_comma_ for the concept sell _comma_ I identified two sets_comma_ one using the word d ol most sites in Ireland _comma_ and one using the word creic Rathlin Island_comma_ the Isle of Man_comma_ and Scotland .
E95-1009.txt,76,The dialects partitioned in a different way according to how much stress they placed on the verb relative to the pronoun in I sold even stress in Dunlewy and four of the Scottish sites_comma_ else extra stress on the verb .
E95-1009.txt,77,Not all partitions covered the entire map.
E95-1009.txt,79,Closely related is the idea of word identity_comma_ where the words are not counted the same unless all of their morphemes agree.
E95-1009.txt,80,In this analysis_comma_ sites that used some form of the word bulldn_comma_ with the suffix dn_comma_ were distinguished from those using the suffix 6g.
E95-1009.txt,81,Another set of approaches for computing distance was based on the phonetics.
E95-1009.txt,82,This computed the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings.
E95-1009.txt,83,The Levenshtein distance is the cost of the least expensive set of insertions_comma_ deletions_comma_ or substitutions that would be needed to transform one string into the other Sankoff and Kruskal_comma_ 1983 .
E95-1009.txt,84,The simplest technique used was phone string comparison.
E95-1009.txt,85,In this approach_comma_ all operations cost 1 unit.
E95-1009.txt,89,It would seem to be more accurate to assign a greater distance to substitut.ions involving greater phonetic distinctions.
E95-1009.txt,90,Unfortunately I know of no comprehensive study on the differences between phones_comma_ at least not for all 277 contrasts made by Wagner.
E95-1009.txt,91,Instead I distinguished them on the basis of twelve phonetic features that systematically account for all of the distinctions in Wagner s inventory nasality_comma_ stricture_comma_ laterality_comma_ articulator_comma_ glottis_comma_ place_comma_ palatalization_comma_ rounding_comma_ length_comma_ height_comma_ strength_comma_ and syllabicity.
E95-1009.txt,92,The features were given discrete ordinal values scaled between 0 and 1_comma_ the exact values being arbitrary.
E95-1009.txt,93,For example_comma_ place took on the values glottal O_comma_ uvular 0.1_comma_ postvelar 0.2_comma_ velar 0.3_comma_ prevelar O. _comma_ palatal 0.5_comma_ alveolar 0.7_comma_ dental 0.8_comma_ and labial l.
E95-1009.txt,94,The distance between any two phones was judged to be the difference between the feature values_comma_ averaged across all twelve features.
E95-1009.txt,95,These distances were used instead of uniform 1 unit costs in computing Levenshtein distance.
E95-1009.txt,96,The resulting metric was called feature string comparison.
E95-1009.txt,97,It could be argued that it is meaningless to compare the phonetics of different words_comma_ as in the case of eallaigh vs. crodh mentioned above.
E95-1009.txt,99,The different approaches are called all word vs. same word feature string comparisons.
E95-1009.txt,100,All of these distance matrices were compared with the isogloss matrix_comma_ to see which of them gives results closest to that base method.
E95-1009.txt,101,I used two different methods of comparison_comma_ Pearson s p computed between all corresponding cells in the 62 Table 1 Correlation of distance matrices to the isogloss distance matrix p K Phone string comparison .95 .76 Feature string comparison Ml word .92 .70 same word .91 .69 Etymon identity .85 .61 Word identity .84 .63 two matrices_comma_ and Kc Average sign Xij Xik Yij Yik which is a derivative of Kendall s r that Dietz 1983 empirically found particularly accurate as a test statistic for comparing distance matrices_comma_ a Table 1 shows that the two measures give parallel results.
E95-1009.txt,102,More importantly_comma_ it shows that the approaches based on string comparisons of the phonetic transcriptions correlate more highly with the isogloss approach than do the word or etymon identity measures.
E95-1009.txt,103,Furthermore_comma_ comparing whole phone letters works better than the more sophi.sticated technique of comparing features_comma_ and restricting comparison to pairs based on the same words does not make the latter any better.
E95-1009.txt,104,Of course_comma_ I do not expect that this technique using flat 1 unit costs will prove superior to all methods that are more sensitive to phonetic details.
E95-1009.txt,105,Feature comparison may work better if features were weighted differentially_comma_ or if the numeric values they assume were assigned less arbitrarily_comma_ or if the Manhattan style distance computation were replaced by some formula that did not assume that the features are independent of each other.
E95-1009.txt,106,An ideal comparison would be based on data telling how likely it is for the one phone to turn into the other in the course of normal language change.
E95-1009.txt,109,The unfortunate fact that such ideal data are lacking is compensated for by the fact that the inexpensive phone string comparison employed in this study performs quite well.
E95-1009.txt,110,3.2 Clustering techniques The traditional agglomerative technique for clustering has been described above.
E95-1009.txt,111,There is some 3That is_comma_ for each site i_comma_ one considers all other pairs of sites_comma_ j and k_comma_ and asks whether the linguistic difference between i and j is greater or less than that between i and k.
E95-1009.txt,112,One counts 1 if the answer is the same for both distance matrices_comma_ 1 if it is different.
E95-1009.txt,113,c is the average of these numbers. variation in how the distance between two clusters is measured.
E95-1009.txt,114,For this study I used the average distance between all pairs of elements that are in different clusters.
E95-1009.txt,115,I compared agglomeration to a top down method that Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990 call partitioning around medoids.
E95-1009.txt,116,This model reduces the 0 2 Jr intractability of topdown approaches discussed above by dramatically reducing the number of binary partitions that are considered.
E95-1009.txt,117,Here one seeks to divide the sites into two groups by finding the two representative sites the medoids around which all the other sites cluster in such a way as to give the least average distance between the sites and their representatives.
E95-1009.txt,118,This is therefore a O N 3 algorithm_comma_ comparable in efficiency to agglomeration.
E95-1009.txt,119,The process was repeated recursively on each dialect.
E95-1009.txt,120,One way of measuring how well a binary clustering technique works for dialect grouping is to compare for each site i its average dissimilarity from the other sites in the same dialect_comma_ a i _comma_ with its average dissimilarity from the sites in the other dialect_comma_ b i .
E95-1009.txt,121,Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990 8386 define the statistic s i to be 1 a i b i if a i is less than b i _comma_ otherwise b i a i 1.
E95-1009.txt,122,The statistic thus ranges from 1 perfect fit to 1 site i would perfectly fit in the other group .
E95-1009.txt,123,Plotting this statistic gives a silhouelte by which the eye call judge how well classified each site is.
E95-1009.txt,124,Averaging this statistic across all sites gives an idea of how felicitous the overall clustering is_comma_ .
E95-1009.txt,125,Figures 1 2 present the silhouette for clustering the isogloss distance matrix by partitioning.
E95-1009.txt,126,This analysis produces a large dialect which groups together the sites in Munster_comma_ Scotland_comma_ the Isle of Man_comma_ and almost all sites in Connacht_comma_ as well as Rathlin Island in Ulster and another which groups together all the other sites in Ulster_comma_ as well as County Cavan in Connacht.
E95-1009.txt,127,Although the Ulster group is fairly tight_comma_ with an g of 0.41_comma_ the other group has a more anemic of 0.25_comma_ with the sites outside of Munster and Southern Connacht being indifferently classified.
E95-1009.txt,128,The weighted for both groups comes out at 0.29.
E95-1009.txt,129,By comparison_comma_ Figures 3 4 show what happens when the traditional agglomerative technique is used.
E95-1009.txt,130,The dialects of Scotland and the Isle of Man form a cluster with a great deal of internal diversity  0.12 _comma_ and all the sites in Ireland form another cluster averaging  0.37_comma_ with only Rathlin Island being indifferently classified.
E95-1009.txt,131,The weighted average is 0.35_comma_ which is superior to that of the partitioning technique.
E95-1009.txt,132,The same comparative results obtain for almost all of the distance measuring techniques.
E95-1009.txt,133,Table 2 shows that the for the first binary split is usually appreciably higher for agglomeration than it is for partitioning.

E95-1009.txt,144,Both group into one looselyconnected entity all the sites in Scotland_comma_ and into another all the sites in Ireland.
E95-1009.txt,145,The isogloss approach groups Manx as a cousin of the Scottish dialects_comma_ and the phonetic approach makes it a cousin of the Irish dialects_comma_ but in both cases the s of Manx is very small less than 0.06 _comma_ making it essentially intermediate between the two groups.
E95-1009.txt,146,Thus the popular notion that Scottish_comma_ Irish and Manx Gaelic are distinct entities is well supported by the analyses.
E95-1009.txt,147,Both analyses group Rathlin Island very weakly with the rest of Irish_comma_ but the s for Rathlin is so low less than 0.09 that its grouping too is essentially arbitrary.
E95-1009.txt,148,This aligns with the fact that authorities disagree as to whether it is a dialect of Irish as does Wagner or of Scottish O Rahilly 1932 191 .
E95-1009.txt,149,Except for Rathlin Island_comma_ both methods group the Irish sites into one group containing all the sites in Ulster_comma_ and another_comma_ Southern_comma_ group_comma_ which itself breaks into a group containing all the sites in Connacht and one containing all the sites in Munster.
E95-1009.txt,150,4 Both methods agree on how the 87 sites are distributed among these dialects.
E95-1009.txt,151,This three way division accords with the universal perception that Ulster_comma_ Connacht and Munster form the three major dialect groups.
E95-1009.txt,152,The special status of Ulster contradicts the position of O Rahilly 1932 18 that Connacht groups with Ulster to form a Northern dialect over against Munster.
E95-1009.txt,153,But it agrees with Elsie s finding 1986 255 that that province is lexicostatistically more remote from Connacht and Munster than those two are from each other.
E95-1009.txt,154,Furthermore_comma_ Hindley reports 1990 63 that speakers of other dialects often switch off radio broadcasts in Ulster Irish_comma_ which is very distinctive .
E95-1009.txt,155,Thus the classification of the major Gaelic dialects gives the same general results by both distance metrics_comma_ if one discounts Manx and Rathlin Island Gaelic_comma_ which are flagged as indifferent in both schemes.
E95-1009.txt,156,It is encouraging that the resultant dialect areas are continuous_comma_ align with traditional provincial boundaries_comma_ and agree with commonly accepted taxonomies.
E95-1009.txt,157,However_comma_ dialect groupings at narrower levels_comma_ such as the exact subgrouping of the major provincial dialects_comma_ are at this point unstable.
E95-1009.txt,158,This is no doubt to be explained by the fairly small number of mapped concepts on which the distance metrics are based 51 .
E95-1009.txt,159,5 As language 4The one site ill Co. Cavan is intermediate between tile Ulster and the Southern group.
E95-1009.txt,160,Wagner also gives two sites in Leinster.
E95-1009.txt,161,The more southern site_comma_ in Kilkenny_comma_ groups with the Southern group_comma_ and the more northern site_comma_ in Co. Louth_comma_ groups with Ulster_comma_ and indeed the county used to be considered part of that province.
E95-1009.txt,162,5S guy 1973 cites empirical research suggesting 65 differences get smaller_comma_ one expects that more data will be required in order to elucidate them.
E95-1009.txt,163,4 Conclusions This experiment shows that an automatic procedure can reliably group a language into its diMeet areas_comma_ starting from nothing more than phonetic transcriptions as commonly found in linguistic surveys.
E95-1009.txt,164,Accurate distance matrices_comma_ corresponding highly to those obtained by the tedious uncovering of thousands of isoglosses_comma_ can be obtained by averaging the Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings_comma_ weighting equally all insertion_comma_ deletion_comma_ and substitution operations on the constituent phones.
E95-1009.txt,165,This turns out to be quite a bit more precise than the common technique of measuring distances by judging etymon identity_comma_ and requires even less editorial work.
E95-1009.txt,166,That phonetic comparison is more precise is not particularly surprising_comma_ since etymon identity ignores a wealth of phonetic_comma_ phonological_comma_ and morphological data_comma_ whereas comparing phones has the side effect of also counting higher level variation if words differ in morphemes_comma_ their phonetic difference is going to be high.
E95-1009.txt,167,As for clustering the sites into dialect areas_comma_ the familiar bottom up agglomeration method proves superior to top down partitioning around medoids.
E95-1009.txt,168,Of course simply knowing the dialect areas is not the last word in dialectology.
E95-1009.txt,169,There remain such essential problems as identifying the differing linguistic structures that characterize the dialects_comma_ and discovering their history.
E95-1009.txt,170,But all of these tasks will be greatly facilitated by a quick and accurate grouping of the dialects. .
E95-1040.txt,1,this paper we present a semantic study of motion complexes ie. of a motion verb followed by a spatial preposition . We focus on the spatial and the temporal intrinsic semantic properties of the motion verbs_comma_ on the one hand_comma_ and of the spatial prepositions_comma_ on the other hand.
E95-1040.txt,2,Then we address the problem of combining these basic semantics in order to formally and automatically derive the spatiotemporal semantics of a motion complex from the spatiotemporal properties of its components.
E95-1040.txt,4,Most of natural languages provide two types of lexical items to describe the motion of an entity with respect to some location motion verbs to run to enter and spatial prepositions from towards .
E95-1040.txt,5,Motion verbs can be used directly with a location_comma_ when they are transitive to cross the town or with a spatial preposition_comma_ when they are intransitive to go through the town .
E95-1040.txt,6,The latter case is more interesting most of the French motion verbs are intransitive and the interaction between motion verbs and spatial prepositions gives detailed informations about the way human beeings mentally represent spatiotemporal aspects of a motion.
E95-1040.txt,7,When we describe a motion_comma_ the fact to choose a verb instead of another_comma_ a preposition instead of another_comma_ a syntactic structure instead of another_comma_ reveals our mental cognitive representation.
E95-1040.txt,8,We claim that natural languages can be considered as a trace of these representations_comma_ in which it is possible_comma_ with systematic and detailled linguistic studies_comma_ to light up the way spatiotemporal properties are represented and on which basic concepts these representations lie.
E95-1040.txt,9,We present such linguistic investigations on French motion verbs and spatial prepositions and the basic concepts we have found.
E95-1040.txt,10,We also address compositional semantics for motion complexes ie. a motion verb followed by a spatial preposition and show that the complexity and the refinements of the linguistic studies presented just before are justified and required at the compositional level in order to capture the different behaviours in the compositional processes that exist with the French language.
E95-1040.txt,11,We also compare with the English language and draw some conclusions on the benefits of our approach.
E95-1040.txt,12,2 Lexical Semantics for Motion Verbs Following Gruber 1965 _comma_ Jackendoff 1976 _comma_ Boons 1985 _comma_ we approach motion verbs in terms of some localist semantical role labels.
E95-1040.txt,13,The linguistic study of French intransitive motion verbs see eg. Asher Sablayrolles_comma_ 1994a we have realized has allowed the definition of an ontology for location in three basic concepts locations which are concrete places a room a house a street  positions which are parts of a location the position where I am in this room  postures which are ways to be in a position to be standing_comma_ sitting_comma_ lying .
E95-1040.txt,14,With the help of this ontology we have realized a typology for intransitive motion verbs.
E95-1040.txt,15,We distinguish 4 categories on the basis of which kind of location they intrinsically refer to. Change of location COL verbs entrerto enter sortir to go out denote a change of location.
E95-1040.txt,16,When we enter some place or go out of some place_comma_ we have different spatial relation with the location ie. inside outside before and after the n otion. Change of position verbs voyager to travel courir to run denote a change of position.
E95-1040.txt,17,When we travel or run_comma_ we go from some part to another part of a same global location.
E95-1040.txt,18,Such verbs do not behave all homogeneously.
E95-1040.txt,19,Some denote a change of position which always occur voyager to trave D. For 281 example_comma_ we cannot say voyager sur place to travel in place. We call these verbs change of position CoPs verbs.
E95-1040.txt,20,Others denote only possible change of position courir to run .
E95-1040.txt,21,For example_comma_ we can say courir sur place to run in place.
E95-1040.txt,22,We call these verbs inertial change of position ICoPs verbs. Change of posture CoPtu verbs s asseoir to sit down se baisser to bend down .
E95-1040.txt,23,They denote a change of the relations between the parts of an entity.
E95-1040.txt,24,For the following_comma_ we will focus on CoL verbs the Change of Location verbs _comma_ mainly because they are rich in spatiotemporal informations_comma_ but also because we have at disposal exhaustive lists of French CoL verbs.
E95-1040.txt,25,We have realized a systematic and fine linguistic study on these verbs_comma_ looking carefully at each of them_comma_ one by one and we have 440 CoL verbs in French _comma_ in order to extract their intrinsic spatiotemporal properties.
E95-1040.txt,26,These semantic properties can be characterized by a restructuration of the space induced by the so called reference location lref cf. Talmy_comma_ 1983 .
E95-1040.txt,27,This lref_comma_ implicitly suggested by each CoL verb_comma_ can be either the initial location as with partirto leave sortir t0 go out _comma_ or the path passer_comma_ traverser to pass through or the final location arriver to arrive entrer to enter of the motion.
E95-1040.txt,28,Indeed_comma_ verbs like sortir intrinsically suggest a location of which we have gone out.
E95-1040.txt,29,This space_comma_ induced by the lref_comma_ is characterized by most of the authors in the literature by a two part spatial system consisting in the inside and the outside of the lref.
E95-1040.txt,30,We propose to refine this structure with two new concepts_comma_ required to distinguish minimal pairs like sortir to go out partir to leave _comma_ and entr r to ent r atterir to land .
E95-1040.txt,31,These concepts are 1. a limit of proximity distinguishing an outside of proximity from a far away outside indeed_comma_ if sortir simply requires to go out of the lref_comma_ partir in addition forces the mobile to go sufficiently far away from that lref.
E95-1040.txt,32,2. an external zone of contact required by verbs like atterir for which the final location is neither the lref in contrast with entrer or the outside or proximity outside of the lref in contrast with s approcher o approach .
E95-1040.txt,33,We have so defined a structuration of the space based on 4 zones  the inside o the external zone of contact o the outside of proximity o the far away outside.
E95-1040.txt,34,This structuration is close to the way J ackendoff and Landau 1992 encode the space induced by the reference object introduced by a static spatial preposition.
E95-1040.txt,35,As we have come to these distinctions by examining different linguistic material_comma_ we conclude that language structures space in the same way whatever sort of lexical items motion verbs dynamic static spatial prepositions we examine.
E95-1040.txt,36,This has allowed us to classify CoL verbs into 10 classes on the basis of which zones the mobile is inside_comma_ at the beginning and at the end of its motion.
E95-1040.txt,37,Note that all the geometrical possibilities are not lexicalized in French.
E95-1040.txt,38,3 Lexical Semantics for Spatial Prepositions We have followed the same approach with French spatial prepositions_comma_ but using a structuration of the space induced by the location introduced in the PP by the preposition_comma_ and not induced by the lref as for verbs.
E95-1040.txt,40,We have classified 199 such French prepositions into 16 groups using in addition of our zones two other criteria prepositions can be positional like in directional like into directional prepositions can be Initial like from Medial like through Final like to depending if they focus on the initial location_comma_ on the path or on the final location of the motion.
E95-1040.txt,41,4 Compositional Semantics for Motion Complexes The linguistic studies_comma_ used for the typologies of CoL verbs and spatial prepositions_comma_ have been realized on verbs considered without any adjuncts_comma_ in their atemporal form and independently of any context_comma_ on the one hand_comma_ and on prepositions considered independently of any context_comma_ on the other.
E95-1040.txt,42,This methodology_comma_ discussed in Borillo Sablayrolles 1993 _comma_ has allowed us to extract the intrinsic semantics of these lexical items.
E95-1040.txt,43,Since natural languages put together verbs and prepositions in a sentence_comma_ we have developped a formal calculus see Asher Sablayrolles_comma_ 1994b _comma_ based on these two typologies_comma_ which computes_comma_ in a compositional way_comma_ the spatiotemporal properties of a motion complex from the semantic properties of the verb and of the preposition.
E95-1040.txt,44,For reason of space we cannot detail our formalism here_comma_ but we intend to present it in the talk.
E95-1040.txt,45,282 The semantics of a motion complex is not the simple addition of the semantics of its constituents.
E95-1040.txt,46,On the contrary_comma_ it is the result of a complex interaction between these properties.
E95-1040.txt,47,It is often the case that from this interaction appear new properties that belong neither to the verb or the preposition.
E95-1040.txt,48,These new properties are only the result of the interaction of the verb with the preposition.
E95-1040.txt,49,Let us consider for example the following VP sortir dans le jardin to go out into the garden.
E95-1040.txt,50,The verb sortir to go out implicitly suggests an initial location the preposition darts which means in_comma_ but which is translated here by into is a positional preposition and_comma_ as so_comma_ only denotes the static spatial relation inside.
E95-1040.txt,51,The location le jardin the garden is the final location of the motion.
E95-1040.txt,52,This final information was contained neither in the verb or in the preposition.
E95-1040.txt,53,This information is the result of the interaction of the verb sortir to go out with the preposition dans in qnto.
E95-1040.txt,54,Note that the combination for such items does not behave the same in English_comma_ where the final information is explicitly brought by the preposition into_comma_ which is a directional preposition_comma_ and where this particular combination does not create new information.
E95-1040.txt,55,This shows the neccesity to take into account such language specific behaviour in natural languages understanding systems and in natural languages machine translation.
E95-1040.txt,56,We formalize with 11 axioms in a non monotonic first order logic the behaviour of all possible kinds of verb preposition association for the French language.
E95-1040.txt,57,We use nonmonotonic logic in order to represent defensible or generic rules and also in order to encode defaults about lexical entries.
E95-1040.txt,58,These axioms are based on the lexieal semantics of CoL verbs and of spatial prepositions.
E95-1040.txt,59,They also take into account the syntactic structure of the sentence we have supposed an X bar syntax with a VP internal subject_comma_ though this is not essential and the links which exist at the level of diseours between this sentence and the previous and following sentences of the text.
E95-1040.txt,60,These links_comma_ called discourse relations_comma_ are basic concepts on which texts are structured cf. Asher_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1040.txt,61,5 Conclusion The study and the first results we have here presented cover from lexical semantics to discourse structures_comma_ with strong interactions between these two ends.
E95-1040.txt,62,Indeed_comma_ lexical informations can be used to disambiguate the structure of the discours_comma_ as well as discourse relations can be used to disambiguate lexical entries_comma_ as shown in Asher Sablayrolles_comma_ 1994b .
E95-1040.txt,63,Our work is based on systematic and very detailed linguistic studies which lead to rather complex computations for calculating the spatiotemporal semantics of a motion complex.
E95-1040.txt,64,But we have seen that this level of detail and complexity is necessary if one want to understand_comma_ to formalize and to compute a right spatiotemporal semantics for motion complexes.
E95-1040.txt,65,We continue our investigations on two directions 1. we compare our results with similar works in course of realization on the Basquian language by Michel Aurnague and on the Japanese language by Junichi Saito 2. we use the results presented here for refining the notions of the Aktionsart_comma_ where the structuration of the space in 4 zones can be used to distinguish sub classes inside the traditional well known classes of aspectual studies. .
E95-1041.txt,1,anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase PP attachment are the most frequent ambiguities in natural language processing. Several methods have been proposed to deal with each phenomenon separately_comma_ however none of proposed systems has considered the way of dealing both phenomena We tackle this issue here_comma_ proposing an algorithm to co ordinate the treatment of these two problems efficiently_comma_ i.e._comma_ the aim is also to exploit at each step all the results that each component can provide.
E95-1041.txt,3,Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase PP attachment phenomenon and separately_comma_ so that the literature is very abundant for PPs see e.g._comma_ Frazier and Fodor_comma_ 1979 Hobbs_comma_ 1990 _comma_ and Wilks and Huang_comma_ 1985 _comma_ and for anaphora see e.g._comma_ Carter_comma_ 1986 Reinhart_comma_ 1983 and Sidner_comma_ 1983 .
E95-1041.txt,4,However none of these methods has considered the way of dealing both phenomena in the same concrete system.
E95-1041.txt,5,We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena_comma_ in the same analyser.
E95-1041.txt,6,The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods_comma_ uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach_comma_ see Sidner_comma_ 1983 .
E95-1041.txt,7,These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents.
E95-1041.txt,8,Concerning the PPs_comma_ unattached prepositions involve empty or unfilled roles in the Conceptual Structures CSs _comma_ expressed in a frame based language Zarri_comma_ 1999 .
E95-1041.txt,9,The disambiguation procedure alms at filling the empty roles using attachment rules.
E95-1041.txt,10,This work was accomplished in the context of COBALT project LRE 61 01 _comma_ dealing with financial news.
E95-1041.txt,11,A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in Azzam_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1041.txt,12,2 The algorithm Two of the main principles of the algorithm are a The algorithm is applied on the text sentence by sentence_comma_ i.e. the ambiguities of the previous sentences have already been considered resolved or not . b The anaphora procedure skips the resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition.
E95-1041.txt,13,This is because the resolution rules may have an empty role as a parameter_comma_ due to this unattached preposition.
E95-1041.txt,14,The resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the second phase of anaphora resolution.
E95-1041.txt,15,The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module.
E95-1041.txt,16,The output of each call is a set of CSs that represent the intermediate resuits exchanged between each call and on which both modules operate in turn.
E95-1041.txt,17,The aim is to fill the unfilled roles in the CSs_comma_ due to anaphora or unattached PPs.
E95-1041.txt,18,To summarize the algorithm is 1 Apply the anaphora module first.
E95-1041.txt,19,2 Apply the PP attachment procedure.
E95-1041.txt,20,3 If some anaphora.are left unresolved_comma_ apply the anaphora module again.
E95-1041.txt,21,4 If there are still unattached PPs_comma_ apply the attachment procedure again.
E95-1041.txt,22,5 Repeat 3 and 4 _comma_ until all VPs and anaphors are treated.
E95-1041.txt,23,The order in which the two modules are called is based on efficiency deduced from statistical data performed on COBALT corpuses.
E95-1041.txt,24,Three main cases are faced by the algorithm a When the anaphor occurs before a given preposition in the sentence_comma_ its resolution does not depend on where the preposition is to be attached except for cataphors that are quite rare .
E95-1041.txt,25,In this 284 case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure.
E95-1041.txt,26,The example 1 below shows that the resolution of the anaphoric pronoun that must be performed first and that the PP starting with of be attached later.
E95-1041.txt,27,1 The sale of Credito was first proposed last August and that of BCI late last lear. b When the anaphor occurs after one or several unattached prepositions_comma_ it could be an intrasententiai anaphor i.e. referring to an entity in the same sentence _comma_ then its resolution may depend on one of the previous prepositional phrases.
E95-1041.txt,28,In this case_comma_ the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle b stated above.
E95-1041.txt,29,c When the anaphor is included in a PP particular case of b _comma_ PP attachment rules need semantic information about the object of the PP when it is a pronoun_comma_ no semantic information is available_comma_ so that the attachment rules can not be applied.
E95-1041.txt,30,The anaphoric pronouns have to be resolved first_comma_ so as to determine what semantic class they refer to the PP attachment procedure can then be applied.
E95-1041.txt,31,When a sequence contains more than two such PPs_comma_ i.e._comma_ with anaphors as objects_comma_ the length of a cycle is more than 4.
E95-1041.txt,32,3 An example  UPHB shares have been suspended since October g at the firm s request following a surge in its share price on a takeover rumour.
E95-1041.txt,33,The pronoun its can not be resolved by the anaphora resolution module because it is preceded by unattached PPs its resolution is skipped.

E95-1041.txt,35,The anaphora module is called again to resolve the anaphoric pronoun its_comma_ which is possible_comma_ in this example_comma_ since the previous PPs have been attached and there is no anaphors before.
E95-1041.txt,36,Finally_comma_ the PP attachment procedure has to be called again for the in PP.
E95-1041.txt,37,Notice that even if each module is called several times_comma_ there is no redundancy in the processing.
E95-1041.txt,38,The algorithm should be considered as the splitting of both anaphora resolution and PP attachment procedures into several phases and not as the repetition of each procedure.
E95-1041.txt,39,4 Conclusion The objective was to emphasise more than it has been done until now_comma_ the fact that PP attachment and anaphora resolution could interact in the same system in order to produce a complete conceptual analysis_comma_ instead of slowing down each other.
E95-1041.txt,40,The algorithm we proposed in this. paper_comma_ is independent of the used approaches in both anaphora and attachment modules.
E95-1041.txt,41,It concerns rather the way of managing the interaction between the two modules.
E95-1041.txt,42,Our actual work addresses more the problems inside each module.
E95-1041.txt,43,The attachment module has been implemented at 99 .
E95-1041.txt,44,Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases. .
E95-1010.txt,1,methods based on byte length comparisons of alignment blocks have been remarkably successful for aligning good translations from legislative transcriptions. For noisy translations in which the parallel text of a document has significant structural differences_comma_ byte alignment methods often do not perform well.
E95-1010.txt,2,The Pan American Health Organization PAHO corpus is a series of articles that were first translated by machine methods and then improved by professional translators.
E95-1010.txt,3,Many of the Spanish PAHO texts do not share formatting conventions with the corresponding English documents_comma_ refer to tables in stylistically different ways and contain extraneous information.
E95-1010.txt,4,A method based on a dynamic programming framework_comma_ but using a decision criterion derived from a combination of byte length ratio measures_comma_ hard matching of numbers_comma_ string comparisons and n gram co occurrence matching substantially improves the performance of the alignment process.
E95-1010.txt,6,Given texts in two languages that are to some degree translations of one another_comma_ an alignment of the texts associates sentences_comma_ paragraphs or phrases in one document with their translations in the other.
E95-1010.txt,7,Successful approaches to alignment can be divided into two primary types those that use comparisons of lexical elements between the documents Wu_comma_ 1994 Chen 1993 Catizone_comma_ Russell and Warwick_comma_ 1989 _comma_ and IThis research was funded under DoD Contract MDA 904 94 C E086 those that use a statistical decision process derived from byte length ratios between alignment blocks Wu_comma_ 1994 Church_comma_ 1993 Gale and Church_comma_ 1991 .
E95-1010.txt,8,Methods vary for the former approach_comma_ hut in the latter approach_comma_ a dynamic programming framework is used to sequentially align blocks as the alignment process proceeds.
E95-1010.txt,10,In the primary literature on alignment_comma_ the texts are typically well behaved.
E95-1010.txt,11,In byte length ratio approaches_comma_ the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic_comma_ and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching Wu_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1010.txt,12,When combined with radical formatting departures between documents that often arise in text translations_comma_ the difficulties of producing good alignments are exacerbated by the presence of untranslated segments_comma_ textual rearrangements and other problematic text features.
E95-1010.txt,13,The dynamic programming framework makes long runs of segments that have no translation in their parallel text difficult to ignore because the limited window size prevents passing over those segments to reach appropriate areas of the document further downstream.
E95-1010.txt,14,Taken together_comma_ these difficulties can be catastrophic to the alignment process.
E95-1010.txt,15,Our experience shows that the fraction of correct alignments can drop to less than 5 .

E95-1017.txt,1,paper describes a parser for Categorial Grammar which provides fully word by word incremental interpretation. The parser does not require fragments of sentences to form constituents_comma_ and thereby avoids problems of spurious ambiguity.
E95-1017.txt,2,The paper includes a brief discussion of the relationship between basic Categorial Grammar and other formalisms such as HPSG_comma_ Dependency Grammar and the Lambek Calculus.
E95-1017.txt,3,It also includes a discussion of some of the issues which arise when parsing lexicalised grammars_comma_ and the possibilities for using statistical techniques for tuning to particular languages.
E95-1017.txt,5,There is a large body of psycholinguistic evidence which suggests that meaning can be extracted before the end of a sentence_comma_ and before the end of phrasal constituents e.g. Marslen Wilson 1973_comma_ Tanenhaus et al. 1990 .
E95-1017.txt,6,There is also recent evidence suggesting that_comma_ during speech processing_comma_ partial interpretations can be built extremely rapidly_comma_ even before words are completed SpiveyKnowlton et al. 1994 1.
E95-1017.txt,7,There are also potential computational applications for incremental interpretation_comma_ including early parse filtering using statistics based on logical form plausibility_comma_ and interpretation of fragments of dialogues a survey is provided by Milward and Cooper_comma_ 1994_comma_ henceforth referred to as M C .
E95-1017.txt,8,In the current computational and psycholinguistic literature there are two main approaches to the incremental construction of logical forms.
E95-1017.txt,9,One approach is to use a grammar with non standard This research was supported by the U.K.
E95-1017.txt,10,Science and Engineering Research Council_comma_ grant RR30718.
E95-1017.txt,11,I am grateful to Patrick Sturt_comma_ Carl Vogel_comma_ and the reviewers for comments on an earlier version.
E95-1017.txt,12,1Spivey Knowlton et al. reported 3 experiments.
E95-1017.txt,13,One showed effects before the end of a word when there was no other appropriate word with the same initial phonology.
E95-1017.txt,14,Another showed on line effects from adjectives and determiners during noun phrase processing. constituency_comma_ so that an initial fragment of a sentence_comma_ such as John likes_comma_ can be treated as a constituent_comma_ and hence be assigned a type and a semantics.
E95-1017.txt,15,This approach is exemplified by Combinatory Categorial Grammar_comma_ CCG Steedman 1991 _comma_ which takes a basic CG with just application_comma_ and adds various new ways of combining elements together 2.
E95-1017.txt,16,Incremental interpretation can then be achieved using a standard bottom up shift reduce parser_comma_ working from left to right along the sentence.
E95-1017.txt,17,The alternative approach_comma_ exemplified by the work of Stabler on top down parsing Stabler 1991 _comma_ and Pulman on left corner parsing Pulman 1986 is to associate a semantics directly with the partial structures formed during a topdown or left corner parse.
E95-1017.txt,20,likes john_comma_x _comma_ without having to say that John likes is a constituent.
E95-1017.txt,21,Neither approach is without problems.
E95-1017.txt,22,If a grammar is augmented with operations which are powerful enough to make most initial fragments constituents_comma_ then there may be unwanted interactions with the rest of the grammar examples of this in the case of CCG and the Lambek Calculus are given in Section 2 .
E95-1017.txt,23,The addition of extra operations also means that_comma_ for any given reading of a sentence there will generally be many different possible derivations so called spurious ambiguity _comma_ making simple parsing strategies such as shift reduce highly inefficient.
E95-1017.txt,24,The limitations of the parsing approaches become evident when we consider grammars with left recursion.
E95-1017.txt,25,In such cases a simple top down parser will be incomplete_comma_ and a left corner parser will resort to buffering the input so won t be fully 2Note that CCG doesn t provide a type for all initial fragments of sentences. For example_comma_ it gives a type to John thinks Mary_comma_ but not to John thinks each. In contrast the Lambek Calculus Lambek 1958 provides an infinite number of types for any initial sentence fragment.
E95-1017.txt,26,119 word by word .
E95-1017.txt,27,M C illustrate the problem by considering the fragment Mary thinks John.
E95-1017.txt,28,This has a small number of possible semantic representations the exact number depending upon the grammar e.g. _comma_P.thinks mary_comma_ P john AP.AQ.
E95-1017.txt,29,Q thinks mary_comma_P john  _comma_P.AR.
E95-1017.txt,30,R Ax.thinks x_comma_P john  mary The second representation is appropriate if the sentence finishes with a sentential modifier.
E95-1017.txt,31,The third allows there to be a verb phrase modifier.
E95-1017.txt,32,If the semantic representation is to be read off syntactic structure_comma_ then the parser must provide a single syntax tree possibly with empty nodes .
E95-1017.txt,33,However_comma_ there are actually any number of such syntax trees corresponding to_comma_ for example_comma_ the first semantic representation_comma_ since the np and the s can be arbitrarily far apart.
E95-1017.txt,34,The following tree is suitable for the sentence Mary thinks John shaves but not for e.g.
E95-1017.txt,35,Mary thinks John coming here was a mistake.
E95-1017.txt,37,One further possibility is to choose a single syntax tree_comma_ and to use destructive tree operations later in the parse a.
E95-1017.txt,38,The approach which we will adopt here is based on Milward 1992_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1017.txt,39,Partial syntax trees can be regarded as performing two main roles.
E95-1017.txt,40,The first is to provide syntactic information which guides how the rest of the sentence can be integrated into the tree.
E95-1017.txt,41,The second is to provide a basis for a semantic representation.
E95-1017.txt,42,The first role can be captured using syntactic types_comma_ where each type corresponds to a potentially infinite number of partial syntax trees.
E95-1017.txt,43,The second role can be captured by the parser constructing semantic representations directly.
E95-1017.txt,44,The general processing model therefore consists of transitions of the form Syntactic type i Syntactic typei 1 Semantic repi Semantic repi 1 3This might turn out to be similar to one view of Tree Adjoining Grammar_comma_ where adjunction adds into a pre existing well formed tree structure.
E95-1017.txt,45,It is also closer to some methods for incremental adaptation of discourse structures_comma_ where additions are allowed to the right frontier of a tree structure e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984 .
E95-1017.txt,46,There are however problems with this kind of approach when features are considered see e.g. Vijay Shanker 1992 .
E95-1017.txt,47,This provides a state transition or dynamic model of processing_comma_ with each state being a pair of a syntactic type and a semantic value.
E95-1017.txt,48,The main difference between our approach and that of Milward 1992_comma_ 1994 is that it is based on a more expressive grammar formalism_comma_ Applicative Categorial Grammar_comma_ as opposed to Lexicalised Dependency Grammar.
E95-1017.txt,49,Applicative Categorial Grammars allow categories to have arguments which are themselves functions e.g. very can be treated as a function of a function_comma_ and given the type n n n n when used as an adjectival modifier .
E95-1017.txt,50,The ability to deal with functions of functions has advantages in enabling more elegant linguistic descriptions_comma_ and in providing one kind of robust parsing the parser never fails until the last word_comma_ since there could always be a final word which is a function over all the constituents formed so far.
E95-1017.txt,51,However_comma_ there is a corresponding problem of far greater non determinism_comma_ with even unambiguous words allowing many possible transitions.
E95-1017.txt,52,It therefore becomes crucial to either perform some kind of ambiguity packing_comma_ or language tuning.
E95-1017.txt,53,This will be discussed in the final section of the paper.
E95-1017.txt,54,2 Applicative Categorial Grammar Applicative Categorial Grammar is the most basic form of Categorial Grammar_comma_ with just a single combination rule corresponding to function application.
E95-1017.txt,55,It was first applied to linguistic description by Adjukiewicz and Bar Hillel in the 1950s.
E95-1017.txt,56,Although it is still used for linguistic description e.g. Bouma and van Noord_comma_ 1994 _comma_ it has been somewhat overshadowed in recent years by HPSG Pollard and Sag 1994 _comma_ and by Lambek Categorial Grammars Lambek 1958 .
E95-1017.txt,57,It is therefore worth giving some brief indications of how it fits in with these developments.
E95-1017.txt,58,The first directed Applicative CG was proposed by Bar Hillel 1953 .
E95-1017.txt,59,Functional types included a list of arguments to the left_comma_ and a list of arguments to the right.
E95-1017.txt,61,Rn X r R1 ...R The result was a system which comes very close to the formalised dependency grammars of Gaifman 1965 and Hays 1964 .
E95-1017.txt,62,The only real difference is that Bar Hillel allowed arguments to themselves be functions.
E95-1017.txt,63,For example_comma_ an adverb such as slowly could be given the type 4 LrO An unfortunate aspect of Bar Hillel s first system was that the application rule only ever resulted in a primitive type.
E95-1017.txt,65,Rather than adapting the Application Rule to allow functions to be applied to one argument at a time_comma_ Bar Hillel s second system often called AB Categorial Grammar_comma_ or Adjukiewicz Bar Hillel CG_comma_ Bar Hillel 1964 adopted a Curried notation_comma_ and this has been adopted by most CGs since.
E95-1017.txt,67,The main impetus to change Applicative CG came from the work of Ades and Steedman 1982 .
E95-1017.txt,68,Ades and Steedman noted that the use of function composition allows CGs to deal with unbounded dependency constructions.
E95-1017.txt,69,Function composition enables a function to be applied to its argument_comma_ even if that argument is incomplete e.g. s pp pp np  s np This allows peripheral extraction_comma_ where the gap is at the start or the end of e.g. a relative clause.
E95-1017.txt,70,Variants of the composition rule were proposed in order to deal with non peripheral extraction_comma_ 4The reformulation is not entirely faithful here to Bar Hillel_comma_ who used a slightly problematic double slash notation for functions of functions.
E95-1017.txt,71,5Lambek notation Lambek 1958 . but this led to unwanted effects elsewhere in the grammar Bouma 1987 .
E95-1017.txt,73,Both techniques can be thought of as marking the wh arguments as requiring special treatment_comma_ and therefore do not lead to unwanted effects elsewhere in the grammar.
E95-1017.txt,74,However_comma_ there are problems with having just composition_comma_ the most basic of the non applicative operations.
E95-1017.txt,75,In CGs which contain functions of functions such as very_comma_ or slowly _comma_ the addition of composition adds both new analyses of sentences_comma_ and new strings to the language.
E95-1017.txt,76,This is due to the fact that composition can be used to form a function_comma_ which can then be used as an argument to a function of a function.
E95-1017.txt,77,For example_comma_ if the two types_comma_ n n and n n are composed to give the type n n_comma_ then this can be modified by an adjectival modifier of type n n n n .
E95-1017.txt,79,Associative CGs with Composition_comma_ or the Lambek Calculus also allow strings such as boy with the to be given the type n n predicting very boy with the car to be an acceptable noun.
E95-1017.txt,80,Although individual examples might be possible to rule out using appropriate features_comma_ it is difficult to see how to do this in general whilst retaining a calculus suitable for incremental interpretation.
E95-1017.txt,81,If wh arguments need to be treated specially anyway to deal with non peripheral extraction _comma_ and if composition as a general rule is problematic_comma_ this suggests we should perhaps return to grammars which use just Application as a general operation_comma_ but have a special treatment for wh arguments.
E95-1017.txt,82,Using the non Curried notation of Bar Hillel_comma_ it is more natural to use a separate wh list than to mark wh arguments individually.
E95-1017.txt,83,For example_comma_ the category appropriate for relative clauses with a noun phrase gap would be lO _comma_ o It is then possible to specify operations which act as purely applicative operations with respect to the left and right arguments lists_comma_ but more like composition with respect to the wh list.
E95-1017.txt,84,This is very similar to the way in which wh movement is dealt with in GPSG Gazdar et al. 1985 and HPSG_comma_ where wh arguments are treated using slash mechanisms or feature inheritance principles 121 which correspond closely to function composition.
E95-1017.txt,85,Given that our arguments have produced a categorial grammar which looks very similar to HPSG_comma_ why not use HPSG rather than Applicative CG
E95-1017.txt,86,The main reason is that Applicative CG is a much simpler formalism_comma_ which can be given a very simple syntax semantics interface_comma_ with function application in syntax mapping to function application in semantics 6 7.
E95-1017.txt,87,This in turn makes it relatively easy to provide proofs of soundness and completeness for an incremental parsing algorithm.
E95-1017.txt,88,Ultimately_comma_ some of the techniques developed here should be able to be extended to more complex formalisms such as HPSG.
E95-1017.txt,89,3 AB Categorial grammar with Associativity AACG In this section we define a grammar similar to BarHillel s first grammar.
E95-1017.txt,90,However_comma_ unlike Bar Hillel_comma_ we allow one argument to be absorbed at a time.
E95-1017.txt,91,The resulting grammar is equivalent to AB Categorial Grammar plus associativity.
E95-1017.txt,92,The categories of the grammar are defined as follows 1.
E95-1017.txt,93,If X is a syntactic type e.g. s_comma_ np _comma_ then 10 is a category.
E95-1017.txt,95,If X is a syntactic type_comma_ and L and R are lists of categories_comma_ then Application to the right is defined by the ruleS 6One area where application based approaches to semantic combination gain in simplicity over unification based approaches is in providing semantics for functions of functions.
E95-1017.txt,96,Moore 1989 provides a treatment of functions of functions in a unification based approach_comma_ but only by explicitly incorporating lambda expressions.
E95-1017.txt,97,Pollard and Sag 1994 deal with some functions of functions_comma_ such as non intersective adjectives_comma_ by explicit set construction.
E95-1017.txt,98,7As discussed above_comma_ wh movement requires something more like composition than application.
E95-1017.txt,99,A simple syntax semantics interface can be retained if the same operation is used in both syntax and semantics.
E95-1017.txt,100,Wh arguments can be treated as similar to other arguments i.e. as lambda .
E95-1014.txt,1,is a highly productive phenomena in most languages. The process of nominalization ejects a verb from its syntactic role into a nominal position.
E95-1014.txt,2,The original verb is often replaced by a semantically emptied support verb e.g._comma_ make a proposal .
E95-1014.txt,3,The choice of a support verb for a given nominalization is unpredictable_comma_ causing a problem for language learners as well as for natural language processing systems.
E95-1014.txt,4,We present here a method of discovering support verbs from an untagged corpus via low level syntactic processing and comparison of arguments attached to verbal forms and potential nominalized forms.
E95-1014.txt,5,The result of the process is a list of potential support verbs for the nominalized form of a given predicate.
E95-1014.txt,7,Nominalization_comma_ the transformation of a verbal phrase into a nominal form_comma_ is possible in most languages Comrie and Thompson_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1014.txt,8,Nominalizations are used for a variety of stylistic reasons to avoid repetitions of a verb_comma_ to avoid awkward intransitive uses of transitive verbs_comma_ in technical descriptions where passive is commonly used_comma_ etc. Though_comma_ as a result of nominalization_comma_ the original verb is ejected from its syntactic position_comma_ it often retains many of its thematic roles.
E95-1014.txt,9,The original agents and patients can reappear as genitival or adjectival modifiers of the nominalized predicate.
E95-1014.txt,10,In the syntactic place of the original verb can appear a semantically impoverished verb.
E95-1014.txt,11,The semantically impoverished verb_comma_ often called a support verb_comma_ to be used with a nominalized predicate structure is unpredictable.
E95-1014.txt,13,We present here a method of deriving probable support verbs for nominalized predicates from corpora using low level syntactic analysis and simple frequency statistics over its results.
E95-1014.txt,14,This automatic procedure may be looked upon as an aid to lexicographers_comma_ as an independent extraction tool_comma_ or as a verification of lexical collocation information stored in a machine based lexicon.
E95-1014.txt,15,Since nominalized predicates can semantically drift over time to become concrete nouns having lost all their thematic role_comma_ our method first attempts to distinguish true nominalizations from concrete uses of the nominalized surface form.
E95-1014.txt,16,This is done by comparing approximations to the argument adjunct structures of verbal predicates to those of candidate nominalized forms in a large corpus.
E95-1014.txt,17,For each selected nominalized form_comma_ syntactically supporting verb information is extracted from the corpus and then collated_comma_ providing the candidates for support verbs.
E95-1014.txt,18,98 1.1 The rqominalization Cline The phenomenon of nominalization in English happens when a verb is replaced by a noun construction using a gerundive or nominal form of the verb.
E95-1014.txt,19,The original subject and objects of the verb can reappear as Saxon or Norman genitives modifying the nominalized form.
E95-1014.txt,20,Quirk et al. Quirk et al._comma_ 1985 distinguish nominalizations between deverbal and verbal nouns.
E95-1014.txt,21,Examples of these are advice vs. killing.
E95-1014.txt,22,Deverbal nouns are defined as records of the action having taken place rather than as description of the action itself.
E95-1014.txt,23,This accounts for the contrast between their arriving for a month and .their arrival for a month.
E95-1014.txt,25,As the following evidence shows_comma_ the semantics of the verb and much of its syntactic structure can be retained by either of its nominalized forms She was surprised that the enemy destroyed the city.
E95-1014.txt,26,She was surprised by the enemy s destroying the city.
E95-1014.txt,27,She was surprised by the enemy s destruction of the city.
E95-1014.txt,28,The cline of nominalization can be seen in the morphological changes 1 that some predicate undergo as they move from an inflected verb e.g. destroyed to non inflected verbal noun destroying to a deverbal noun destruction .
E95-1014.txt,29,In this article we shall consider only deverbal nouns 2 since these are the nominalizations involving the collocational phenomena of support verbs.
E95-1014.txt,30,A remaining problem with the deverbal nouns is that the meaning of such nouns can become concretized over time_comma_ by a aThe morphological processes involved in transforming verbs into nominalizations are described in Quirk et at._comma_ 1985 _comma_ Sections 1.43 conversion and 1.30 suffixation .
E95-1014.txt,31,See also 17.52 for discussion of this cline.
E95-1014.txt,32,2On a practical level_comma_ we will also accept as deverbal nouns those forms ending in ing which are marked as nouns in our lexicon_comma_ e.g. warning. metonymic association.
E95-1014.txt,33,Compare the uses of proposal in He made his formal proposal to the full committee.
E95-1014.txt,34,He put the proposal in the drawer.
E95-1014.txt,35,The concrete uses of deverbal nouns are not involved in support verb constructions since they have lost the semantics of actions_comma_ and their attending thematic roles.
E95-1014.txt,36,2 A very simple approach and its problems Looking for support verbs for nominalizatious might seem an easy problem at first_comma_ given that these support verbs are always the main verb for which the nominalization is the direct object.
E95-1014.txt,37,What is needed is a low level parser that extracts verb object relations from corpora.
E95-1014.txt,38,Given such a parser_comma_ one might be tempted to extract all the main verbs for a given nominalized form and consider tile most frequent of these verbs the expected support verbs.
E95-1014.txt,39,As will be seen below_comma_ this approach is too simple.
E95-1014.txt,40,The examples given above for proposal show that a given word form may be used with a meaning anywhere along the cline from true nominalization to concrete nouns.
E95-1014.txt,41,Counting verbs of which these concrete nouns are direct objects will create noise hiding the true support verbs.
E95-1014.txt,42,Since real nominalizations are those that still have verbal character_comma_ i.e. they have retained the semantic roles from the verb_comma_ we will try to recognize true nominalized uses by comparing the most frequent argument adjunct structures found in the corpus around verbal uses of a given predicate to those syntactic structures found around tile candidate nominalized forms 3.
E95-1014.txt,43,We will define true nominalizations as those which have a parallel syntactic structure to the original verb.
E95-1014.txt,46,The noun head of such a phrase is normally related morphologically to a verb_comma_ or to an adjective i.e._comma_ a deverbal or deadjectival noun .
E95-1014.txt,47,In this article we have been restricting the term nominalization to the noun heading the noun phrase.
E95-1014.txt,48,3 Method In this section we explain our method for extracting support verbs for nominalizations.
E95-1014.txt,49,We suppose that we are given a pair of words ayerb and its nominalized form.
E95-1014.txt,50,As explained in the previous section_comma_ we are interested in extracting only nominalized forms which have not become concrete nouns_comma_ and that this will be done by comparing syntactic structures attached to the verb and noun forms.
E95-1014.txt,51,In order to extract corpus evidence related to these phenomena_comma_ we proceed as follows 1.
E95-1014.txt,52,We generate all the morphologically related forms of the word pair using a lexical transducer for English Karttunen et al._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1014.txt,53,This list of words will be used as corpus filter.
E95-1014.txt,55,The lines of the corpus are tokenized Grefenstette and Tapanainen_comma_ 1994 _comma_ and only sentences containing one of the word forms in the filter are retained.
E95-1014.txt,57,The corpus lines retained are part of speech tagged Cutting et al._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1014.txt,58,This allows us to divide the corpus evidence into verb evidence and noun evidence.
E95-1014.txt,60,Using a robust surface parser Grefenstette_comma_ 1994 _comma_ we derive the local syntactic patterns involving the verbal form and the nominalized form.
E95-1014.txt,62,Considering that nominalized forms retain some of the verbal characteristics of the underlying predicate_comma_ we want to extract the most common argument adjunct structures found around verbal uses of the predicate.
E95-1014.txt,63,As an approximation_comma_ we extract here all the prepositional phrases found after the verb.
E95-1014.txt,65,For nominal forms_comma_ we select only those uses which involve argument adjunct structures similar to phrases extracted in the previous step.
E95-1014.txt,66,For these selected nominalized forms_comma_ we extract the verbs of which these forms are the direct frequency 458 million 438 billion 296 accord 260 increase 239 call 201 year 198 change 178 support 154 proposal 154 percent 143 money 142 plan 139 cut 130 aid 124 program 122 people Figure 1 The most common nouns preceding the most common prepositions following propose _comma_ and appearing in the same environment. object.
E95-1014.txt,67,We sort these verbs by frequency.
E95-1014.txt,69,This sorted list is the list of candidate support verbs for the nominalization.
E95-1014.txt,70,This method assumes that the verb and the nominalized form of the verb are given.
E95-1014.txt,71,We have experimented with automatically extracting the nominalized form by using the prepositional patterns extracted for the verb in step 5.
E95-1014.txt,72,We extracted 6 megabytes of newspaper articles containing a form of the verb propose propose_comma_ proposes_comma_ proposed_comma_ proposing.
E95-1014.txt,73,Since one use of nominalization is to avoid repetition of the verb form_comma_ we suppose that the nominalization of propose is likely to appear in the same articles.
E95-1014.txt,74,We extracted the three most common prepositions following a form of propose step 5 .
E95-1014.txt,75,We then extracted the nouns appearing in these same artigles and which preceded these prepositions. oThe results 4 appear in figure 1.
E95-1014.txt,76,Since a nomilmlized form is normally morphologically related to the verb form_comma_ almost any morphological comparison method will pick proposal from this list.
E95-1014.txt,77,4Further experimentation has confirmed these results_comma_ but indicate that it may sufficient to simply tag a text_comma_ and perform morphological comparison with the most commonly cooccurring nouns in order to extract the nominalized forms of verbs.
E95-1014.txt,78,100 frequency 167 reject 127 hear 114 make 81 file Figure 2 Most common verbs of which appeal is marked as direct object.
E95-1014.txt,79,4 Experiment with appeal appeal We have taken for example the case of the verb appeal which was interesting since its corresponding deverbal noun shares the same surface form appeal.
E95-1014.txt,80,In order to extract corpus evidence_comma_ we used a lexical transducer of English that_comma_ given the surface word appeal_comma_ produced all the inflected forms appeal_comma_ appeal s_comma_ appealing_comma_ appealed_comma_ appeals and appeals .
E95-1014.txt,81,Using these surface forms as a filter_comma_ we scanned 134 Megabytes of tokenized Associated Press newswire stories from the year 19895.
E95-1014.txt,82,As a result of filtering_comma_ 6704 sentences 1 Mbyte of text were extracted.
E95-1014.txt,83,This text was part of speech tagged using the Xerox HMM tagger Cutting et al._comma_ 1992 .
E95-1014.txt,84,The lexical entries corresponding to appeal were tagged with the following tags as a noun 3910 times _comma_ as an active or infinitival verb 1417 _comma_ as a progressive verb 292 _comma_ and as a past participle 400 .
E95-1014.txt,86,From the output of the dependency parser we extracted all the lexically normalized verbs of which appeal was tagged as a direct object.
E95-1014.txt,87,The most common of these verbs are shown in Figure 2.
E95-1014.txt,88,Our speaker s intuition tells us that the support verb for the nominalized use of appeal is make.
E95-1014.txt,89,But this data does not give us enough information to make this judgement_comma_ since concrete versions as a separate entity are not distinguishable from nomlnalizations of the verb.
E95-1014.txt,90,In order to separate nominalized uses of the predicate appeal from concrete uses_comma_ we will refer to the linguistic discussion presented in the .
E95-1030.txt,1,pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to locate syntactic constituents of natural language. This paper describes a fully automated hybrid system_comma_ using neural nets operating within a grammatic framework.
E95-1030.txt,2,It addresses the representation of language for connectionist processing_comma_ and describes methods of constraining the problem size.
E95-1030.txt,3,The function of the network is briefly explained_comma_ and results are given.
E95-1030.txt,5,The pattern matching capabilities of neural networks can be used to detect syntactic constituents of natural language.
E95-1030.txt,6,This approach bears comparison with probabilistic systems_comma_ but has the advantage that negative as well as positive information can be modelled.
E95-1030.txt,7,Also_comma_ most computation is done in advance_comma_ when the nets are trained_comma_ so the run time computational load is low.
E95-1030.txt,8,In this work neural networks are used as part of a fully automated system that finds a partial parse of declarative sentences.
E95-1030.txt,9,The connectionist processors operate within a grammatic framework_comma_ and are supported by pre processors that filter the data and reduce the problem to a computationally tractable size.
E95-1030.txt,10,A prototype can be accessed via the Internet_comma_ on which users can try their own text details from the authors .
E95-1030.txt,11,It will take a sentence_comma_ locate the subject and then find the head of the subject.
E95-1030.txt,12,Typically 10 sentences take about 2 seconds_comma_ 50 sentences about 4 seconds_comma_ to process on a Sparcl0 workstation.
E95-1030.txt,13,Using the prototype on technical manuals the subject and its head can be detected in over 90 of cases See Section 7 .
E95-1030.txt,14,The well known complexity of parsing is addressed by decomposing the problem_comma_ and then locating one syntactic constituent at a time.
E95-1030.txt,15,The sentence is first decomposed into the broad syntactic categories pre subject subject predicate by locating the subject.
E95-1030.txt,16,Then these constituents can be processed further.
E95-1030.txt,17,The underlying principle employed at each step is to take a sentence_comma_ or part of a sentence_comma_ and generate strings with the boundary markers of the syntactic constituent in question placed in all possible positions.
E95-1030.txt,18,Then a neural net selects the string with the correct placement.
E95-1030.txt,19,This paper gives an overview of how natural language is converted to a representation that the neural nets can handle_comma_ and how the problem is reduced to a manageable size.
E95-1030.txt,20,It then outlines the neural net selection process.
E95-1030.txt,21,A comprehensive account is given in Lyon_comma_ 1994 descriptions of the neural net process are also in Lyon_comma_ 1993 Lyon and Frank_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1030.txt,22,This is a hybrid system.
E95-1030.txt,23,The core process is data driven_comma_ as the parameters of the neural networks are derived from training text.
E95-1030.txt,24,The neural net is trained in supervised mode on examples that have been manually marked correct and incorrect .
E95-1030.txt,25,It will then be able to classify unseen examples.
E95-1030.txt,26,However_comma_ the initial processing stages_comma_ in which the problem size is constrained_comma_ operate within a skeletal grammatic framework.
E95-1030.txt,27,Computational tractability is further addressed by reducing data through the application of prohibitive rules as local constraints.
E95-1030.txt,28,The pruning process is remarkably effective.
E95-1030.txt,29,2 The corpus of sentences from technical manuals This work has principally been developed on text of technical manuals from Perkins Engines Ltd._comma_ which have been translated by a semi automatic process Pyre_comma_ 1993 .
E95-1030.txt,30,Now_comma_ a partial parse can support such a process.
E95-1030.txt,31,For instance_comma_ frequently occurring modal verbs such as must are not dis215 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Number of occurrences 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Number of words before the subject Number of words in the subject 80 72 64 56 48 40 32 24 16 8 Figure I The frequency of constituent length for pre subject and subject in 351 sentences tinguished by number in English_comma_ but they are in many other languages.
E95-1030.txt,32,It is necessary to locate the subject_comma_ then identify the head and determine its number in order to translate the main verb correctly in sentences like 1 below.
E95-1030.txt,34,1 This parser has been trained to find the syntactic subject head that agrees in number with the main verb.
E95-1030.txt,35,The manuals are written using the PACE Perkins Approved Clear English guidelines_comma_ with the aim of producing clear_comma_ unambiguous texts.
E95-1030.txt,36,AlI declarative sentences have been extracted for processing about half were imperatives.
E95-1030.txt,37,This level of classification can be done automatically in future.
E95-1030.txt,38,Table 1 and Figure 1 show some of the characteristics of the corpus.
E95-1030.txt,39,Number of sentences 351 Average length 17.98 words No. of subordinate clauses In pre subject 65 In subject 19 In predicate 136 Co ordinated clauses 50 Punctuation marks are counted as words_comma_ formulae as 1 word.
E95-1030.txt,40,Table 1 Corpus statistics 3 Language representation I In order to reconcile computational feasibility to empirical realism an appropriate form of language representation is critical.
E95-1030.txt,41,The first step in constraining the problem size is to partition an unlimited vocabulary into a restricted number of partof speech tags.
E95-1030.txt,42,Different stages of processing place different requirements on the classification system_comma_ so customised tagsets have been developed.
E95-1030.txt,43,For the first processing stage we need to place the subject markers_comma_ and_comma_ as a further task_comma_ disambiguate tags.
E95-1030.txt,44,It was not found necessary to use number information at this stage.
E95-1030.txt,45,For example_comma_ consider the sentence Still waters run deep.
E95-1030.txt,46,2 The word waters could be a 3rd person_comma_ singular_comma_ present verb or a plural noun.
E95-1030.txt,47,However_comma_ in order to disambiguate the tag and place the subject markers it is only necessary to know that it is a noun or else a verb.
E95-1030.txt,49,2.1 The tagset used at this stage_comma_ mode 1_comma_ has 21 classes_comma_ not distinguished for number.
E95-1030.txt,50,However_comma_ the head of the subject is then found and number agreement with the verb can be assessed.
E95-1030.txt,51,At this stage the tagset_comma_ mode 2_comma_ includes number information and has 28 classes.
E95-1030.txt,52,Devising optimal tagsets for given tasks is a field in which further work is planned.
E95-1030.txt,53,We need larger tagsets to capture more linguistic information_comma_ but smaller ones to constrain the computational load.
E95-1030.txt,54,Information theoretic tools can be used to find the entropy of different tag sequence languages_comma_ and support decisions on representation.
E95-1030.txt,55,A functional approach is taken to tagging words are allocated to classes depending on their syntactic role.
E95-1030.txt,56,For instance_comma_ superlative adjectives can act as nouns_comma_ so they are initially given the 2 tags noun or adjective.
E95-1030.txt,57,This approach can be extended by taking adjacent words which act jointly as single lexical items as a unit.
E95-1030.txt,58,Thus the pair 216 most adjective is taken as a single superlative adjective.
E95-1030.txt,59,Text is automatically tagged using the first modules of the CLAWS program 1985 version _comma_ in which words are allocated one or more tags from 134 classes Garside_comma_ 1987 .
E95-1030.txt,60,These 134 tags are then mapped onto the small customised tagsets.
E95-1030.txt,61,Tag disambiguation is part of the parsing task_comma_ handled by the neural net and its pre processor.
E95-1030.txt,62,This version of CLAWS has a dictionary of about 6_comma_300 words only.
E95-1030.txt,63,Other words are tagged using suffix information_comma_ or else defaults are invoked.
E95-1030.txt,64,The correct tag is almost always included in the set allocated_comma_ but more tags than necessary are often proposed.
E95-1030.txt,65,A larger dictionary in later versions will address this problem.
E95-1030.txt,66,Representing syntactic boundary markers In the same way that tags are allocated to words_comma_ or to punctuation marks_comma_ they can represent the boundaries of syntactic constituents_comma_ such as noun phrases and verb phrases.
E95-1030.txt,67,Boundary markers can be considered invisible tags_comma_ or hypertags_comma_ which have probabilistic relationships with adjacent tags in the same way that words do.
E95-1030.txt,68,Atwell_comma_ 1987 and Church_comma_ 1989 have used this approach.
E95-1030.txt,69,If embedded syntactic constituents are sought in a single pass_comma_ this can lead to computational overload Pocock and Atwell_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1030.txt,70,Our approach uses a similar concept_comma_ but differs in that embedded syntactic constituents are detected one at a time in separate steps.
E95-1030.txt,71,There are only 2 hypertags the opening and closing brackets marking the possible location s of the syntactic constituent in question.
E95-1030.txt,72,Using this representation a hierarchical language structure is converted to a string of tags represented by a linear vector.
E95-1030.txt,73,4 Constraining the generation of candidate strings This system generates sets of tag strings for each sentence_comma_ with the hypertags placed in all possible positions.
E95-1030.txt,74,Thus_comma_ for the subject detection task Then the performance of the pump must be monitored.
E95-1030.txt,79,3.n 1 Hypertags are always inserted in pairs_comma_ so that closure is enforced.
E95-1030.txt,80,There were arbitrary limits of a maximum of 10 words in the pre subject and 10 words within the subject for the initial work described here.
E95-1030.txt,81,These are now extended to 15 words in the pre subject_comma_ 12 in the subject see Section 7.
E95-1030.txt,82,There must be at least one word beyond the end of the subject and before the end of sentence mark.
E95-1030.txt,83,Therefore_comma_ using the initial restrictions_comma_ in a sentence of 22 words or more counting punctuation marks as words there could be 100 alternative placements.
E95-1030.txt,84,However_comma_ some words will have more than one possible tag.
E95-1030.txt,85,For instance_comma_ in sentence 1 above 5 words have 2 alternative tags_comma_ which will generate 25 possible strings before the hypertags are inserted.
E95-1030.txt,86,Since there are 22 words including punctuation the total number of strings would be 25 100 3200.
E95-1030.txt,87,It is not feasible to detect one string out of this number if the classifier marked all strings incorrect the percentage wrongly classified would only be 0.03 _comma_ yet it would be quite useless.
E95-1030.txt,88,In order to find the correct string most of the outside candidates must be dropped_comma_ The skeletal grammatic framework A minimal grammar_comma_ set out in Lyon_comma_ 1994 in EBNF form_comma_ is composed of 9 rules.
E95-1030.txt,89,For instance_comma_ the subject must contain a noun type word.
E95-1030.txt,90,Applying this particular rule to sentence 3 above would eliminate candidate strings 3.1 and 3.2 .
E95-1030.txt,91,We also have the 2 arbitrary limits on length of pre subject and subject.
E95-1030.txt,92,There is a small set of 4 extensions to the grammar_comma_ or semi local constraints.
E95-1030.txt,93,For instance_comma_ if a relative pronoun occurs_comma_ then a verb must follow in that constituent.
E95-1030.txt,94,On the technical manuals the constraints of the grammatic framework put up to 6 of declarative sentences outside our system_comma_ most commonly because the pre subject is too long.
E95-1030.txt,95,A small number are excluded because the system cannot handle a co ordinated head.
E95-1030.txt,96,With the length of pre subject extended to 15 words_comma_ and subject to 12 words_comma_ an average of 2 are excluded 7 out of 351 .
E95-1030.txt,97,Prohibition tables The grammatic framework alone does not reduce the number of candidate strings sufficiently for the subject detection stage.
E95-1030.txt,98,This problem is addressed further by a method suggested by Barton et al. Barton_comma_ Berwick and Ristad_comma_ 1987 that local constraints can rein in the generation of an intractable number of possibilities.
E95-1030.txt,99,In our system the local constraints are prohibited tag pairs and triples.
E95-1030.txt,100,These are adjacent tags which are not allowed_comma_ such as determiner verb or 217 INPUT SENTENCE generate input 1 prune mode l tags find subject _j i ne a_comma_ e wo l enten generate inp fin e2 dn  J gt mode 2 tags KEY with numger O process I I data store  neural network HEAD OF SUBJECT SUBJECT FOUND FOUND Figure 2 Overview of the syntactic pattern recognition process start of subject verb .
E95-1030.txt,101,If during the generation of a candidate string a prohibited tuple is encountered_comma_ then the process is aborted.
E95-1030.txt,102,There are about 100 prohibited pairs and 120 triples.
E95-1030.txt,103,By using these methods the number of candidate strings is drastically reduced.
E95-1030.txt,104,For the technical manuals an average of 4 strings_comma_ seldom more than 15 strings_comma_ are left.
E95-1030.txt,105,Around 25 of sentences are left with a single string.
E95-1030.txt,106,These filters or rules differ fundamentally from generative rules that produce allowable strings in a language.
E95-1030.txt,107,In those cases only productions that are explicitly admitted are allowed.
E95-1030.txt,108,Here_comma_ in contrast_comma_ anything that is not expressly prohibited is allowed.
E95-1030.txt,109,At this stage the data is ready to present to the neural net.
E95-1030.txt,110,Figure 2 gives an overview of the whole process.
E95-1030.txt,111,5 Language representation II Different network architectures have been investigated_comma_ but they all share the same input and output representation.
E95-1030.txt,112,The output from the net is a vector whose 2 elements_comma_ or nodes_comma_ represent correct and incorrect _comma_ yes and no see Figure 3.
E95-1030.txt,113,The input to the net is derived from the candidate strings_comma_ the sequences of tags and hypertags.
E95-1030.txt,114,These must be converted to binary vectors.
E95-1030.txt,115,Each element of the vector will represent a feature that is flagged 0 or 1_comma_ absent or present.
E95-1030.txt,116,Though the form in which the vector is written may give an illusion of representing order_comma_ no sequential order is maintained.
E95-1030.txt,117,A method of representing a sequence must be chosen.
E95-1030.txt,118,The sequential order of the input is captured here_comma_ partially_comma_ by taking adjacent tags_comma_ pairs and triples_comma_ as the feature elements.
E95-1030.txt,119,The individual tags are converted to a bipos and tripos representation.
E95-1030.txt,120,Using this method each tag is in 3 tripos and 2 bipos elements.
E95-1030.txt,121,This highly redundant code will aid the processing of sparse data typical of natural language.
E95-1030.txt,122,For most of the work described here the sentence was dynamically truncated 2 words beyond the hypertag marking the close of the subject.
E95-1030.txt,123,This process has now been improved by going further along the sentence.
E95-1030.txt,124,6 The function of the net The net that gave best results was a simple single layer net Figure 3 _comma_ derived from Wyard and Nightingale s Hodyne net Wyard and Nightingale_comma_ 1990 .
E95-1030.txt,125,This is conventionally a single layer net_comma_ since there is one layer of processing nodes.
E95-1030.txt,126,Multi layer networks_comma_ which can process linearly inseparable data_comma_ were also investigated_comma_ but are not necessary for this particular processing task.
E95-1030.txt,127,The linear separability of data is related to its order_comma_ and this system uses higher order pairs and triples as input.
E95-1030.txt,128,The question of appropriate network architecture is examined in Pao_comma_ 1989 Widrow and Lehr_comma_ 1992 Lyon_comma_ 1994 .
E95-1028.txt,1,describe a compiler and development environment for feature augmented twolevel morphology rules integrated into a full NLP system. The compiler is optimized for a class of languages including many or most European ones_comma_ and for rapid development and debugging of descriptions of new languages.
E95-1028.txt,2,The key design decision is to compose morphophonological and morphosyntactic information_comma_ but not the lexicon_comma_ when compiling the description.
E95-1028.txt,3,This results in typical compilation times of about a minute_comma_ and has allowed a reasonably full_comma_ feature based description of French inflectional morphology to be developed in about a month by a linguist new to the system.
E95-1028.txt,5,The paradigm of two level morphology Koskenniemi_comma_ 1983 has become popular for handling word formation phenomena in a variety of languages.
E95-1028.txt,6,The original formulation has been extended to allow morphotactic constraints to be expressed by feature specification Trost_comma_ 1990 A1shawi et al_comma_ 1991 rather than Koskenniemi s less perspicuous device of continuation classes.
E95-1028.txt,7,Methods for the automatic compilation of rules from a notation convenient for the rule writer into finitestate automata have also been developed_comma_ allowing the efficient analysis and synthesis of word forms.
E95-1028.txt,8,The automata may be derived from the rules alone Trost_comma_ 1990 _comma_ or involve composition with the lexicon Karttunen_comma_ Kaplan and Zaenen_comma_ 1992 .
E95-1028.txt,9,However_comma_ there is often a trade off between runtime efficiency and factors important for rapid and accurate system development_comma_ such as perspicuity of notation_comma_ ease of debugging_comma_ speed of compilation and the size of its output_comma_ and the independence of the morphological and lexical components.
E95-1028.txt,10,In compilation_comma_ one may compose any or all of a the two level rule set_comma_ b the set of affixes and their allowed combinations_comma_ and c the lexicon see Kaplan and Kay 1994 for an exposition of the mathematical basis. The type of compilation appropriate for rapid development and acceptable run time performance depends on_comma_ at least_comma_ the nature of the language being described and the number of base forms in the lexicon that is_comma_ on the position in the three dimensional space defined by a _comma_ b and c .
E95-1028.txt,11,For example_comma_ English inflectional morphology is relatively simple dimensions a and b are fairly small_comma_ so if c _comma_ the lexicon_comma_ is known in advance and is of manageable size_comma_ then the entire task of morphological anMysis can be carried out at compile time_comma_ producing a list of analysed word forms which need only be looked up at run time_comma_ or a network which can be traversed very simply.
E95-1028.txt,12,Alternatively_comma_ there may be no need to provide as powerful a mechanism as two level morphology at all a simpler device such as affix stripping A1shawi_comma_ 1992_comma_ pll9ff or merely listing all inflected forms explicitly may be preferable.
E95-1028.txt,13,For agglutinative languages such as Korean_comma_ Finnish and Turkish Kwon and Karttunen_comma_ 1994 Koskenniemi_comma_ 1983 Oflazer_comma_ 1993 _comma_ dimension b is very large_comma_ so creating an exhaustive word list is out of the question unless the lexicon is trivial.
E95-1028.txt,14,Compilation to a network may still make sense_comma_ however_comma_ and because these languages tend to exhibit few non eoncatenative morphophonological phenomena other than vowel harmony_comma_ the continuation class mechanism may suffice to describe the allowed affix sequences at the surface level.
E95-1028.txt,15,Many European languages are of the inflecting type_comma_ and occupy still another region of the space of difficulty.
E95-1028.txt,16,They are too complex morphologically to yield easily to the simpler techniques that can work for English.
E95-1028.txt,17,The phonological or orthographic changes involved in affixation may be quite complex_comma_ so dimension a can be laige_comma_ and a feature mechanism may be needed to handle such varied but interrelated morphosyn202 tactic phenomena such as umlaut Trost_comma_ 1991 _comma_ case_comma_ number_comma_ gender_comma_ and different morphological paradigms.
E95-1028.txt,18,On the other hand_comma_ while there may be many different affixes_comma_ their possibilities for combination within a word are fairly limited_comma_ so dimension b is quite manageable.
E95-1028.txt,19,This paper describes a representation and associated compiler intended for two level morphological descriptions of the written forms of inflecting languages.
E95-1028.txt,20,The system described is a component of the Core Language Engine CLE AIshawi_comma_ 1992 _comma_ a general purpose language analyser and generator implemented in Prolog which supports both a built in lexicon and access to large external lexical databases.
E95-1028.txt,21,In this context_comma_ highly efficient word analysis and generation at run time are less important than ensuring that the morphology mechanism is expressive_comma_ is easy to debug_comma_ and allows relatively quick compilation.
E95-1028.txt,22,Morphology also needs to be well integrated with other processing levels.
E95-1028.txt,23,In particular_comma_ it should be possible to specify relations among morphosyntactic and morphophonological rules and lexical entries for the convenience of developers_comma_ this is done by means of feature equations.
E95-1028.txt,24,Further_comma_ it cannot be assumed that the lexicon has been fully specified when the morphology rules are compiled.
E95-1028.txt,25,Developers may wish to add and test further lexical entries without frequently recompiling the rules_comma_ and it may also be necessary to deal with unknown words at run time_comma_ for example by querying a large external lexical database or attempting spelling correction Alshawi_comma_ 1992_comma_ pp124 7 .
E95-1028.txt,26,Also_comma_ both analysis and generation of word forms are required.
E95-1028.txt,28,These parameters languages with a complex morphology syntax interface but a limited number of affix combinations_comma_ tasks where the lexicon is not necessarily known at compile time_comma_ bidirectional processing_comma_ and the need to ease development rather than optimize run time efficiency dictate the design of the morphology compiler described in this paper_comma_ in which spelling rules and possible affix combinations items a and b _comma_ but not the lexicon item c _comma_ are composed in the compilation phase.
E95-1028.txt,29,Descriptions of French_comma_ Polish and English inflectional morphology have been developed for it_comma_ and I show how various aspeers of the mechanism allow phenomena in these languages to be handled.
E95-1028.txt,30,2 The Description Language 2.1 Morphophonology The formalism for spelling rules dimension a is a syntactic variant of that of Ruessink 1989 and Pulman 1991 .
E95-1028.txt,31,A rule is of the form spell Name_comma_ Surface Op Lexical_comma_ Classes_comma_ Features .
E95-1028.txt,32,Rules may be optional Op is  or obligatory Op is  .
E95-1028.txt,33,Surface and Lexical are both strings of the form LContext I Target I RContext meaning that the surface and lexical targets may correspond if the left and right contexts and the Features specification are satisfied.
E95-1028.txt,34,The vertical bars simply separate the parts of the string and do not themselves match letters.
E95-1028.txt,36,A partition breaks an obligatory rule if the surface target does not match but everything else_comma_ including the feature specification_comma_ does.
E95-1028.txt,37,The Features in a rule is a list of Feature Value equations.
E95-1028.txt,38,The allowed finite set of values of each feature must be prespecified.
E95-1028.txt,39,Value may be atomic or it may he a boolean expression.
E95-1028.txt,40,Members of the surface and lexieal strings may be characters or classes of single characters.
E95-1028.txt,41,The latter are represented by a single digit N in the string and an item N ClassName in the Classes list multiple occurrences of the same N in a single rule must all match the same character in a given application.
E95-1028.txt,42,Figure I shows three of the French spelling rules developed for this system.
E95-1028.txt,43,The change_e_ l rule simplified slightly here makes it obligatory for a lexical e to be realised as a surface when followed by t_comma_ r_comma_ or l_comma_ then a morpheme boundary_comma_ then e_comma_ as long as the feature cdouble has an appropriate value.
E95-1028.txt,44,The default rule that copies characters between surface and lexical levels and the boundary rule that deletes boundary markers are both optional.
E95-1028.txt,45,Together these rules permit the following realization of cher expensive followed by e feminine gender suffix as chore_comma_ as shown in Figure 2.
E95-1028.txt,47,1 Unlike many other flavours of two level morphology_comma_ the Target parts of a rule need not consist of a single character or class occurrence they can contain more than one_comma_ and the surface target may be empty.
E95-1028.txt,48,This obviates the need for null characters at the surface.
E95-1028.txt,49,However_comma_ although surface targets of any length can usefully be specified_comma_ it is in practicea good strategy 1The cdouble feature is in fact used to specify the spelling changes when e is added to various stems cher e chdre_comma_ achet e ach te_comma_ but jet e jette.
E95-1028.txt,51,Here_comma_ PRESENT_3s is a pseudo affix which has the same syntactic and semantic information attached to it as one sense of the affix t _comma_ which is used to form some regular third person singulars.
E95-1028.txt,52,However_comma_ the spelling rules make no reference to PRESENT_3s it is simply a device allowing categories and logical forms for irregulax words to be built up using the same production rules as for regular words.
E95-1028.txt,53,3 Compilation All rules and lexieal entries in the CLE are compiled to a form that allows normal Prolog unification to be used for category matching at run time.
E95-1028.txt,54,The same compiled forms are used for analysis and generation_comma_ but are indexed differently.
E95-1028.txt,55,Each feature for a major category is assigned a unique position in the compiled Prolog term_comma_ and features for which finite value sets have been specified are compiled into vectors in a form that allows boolean expressions_comma_ involving negation as well as conjunction and disjunction_comma_ to be conjoined by unification see Mellish_comma_ 1988 Alshawi_comma_ 1992_comma_ pp46 48 .
E95-1028.txt,56,The compilation of morphological information is motivated by the nature of the task and of the languages to be handled.
E95-1028.txt,57,As discussed in Section 1_comma_ we expect the number of affix combinations to be limited_comma_ but the lexicon is not necessarily known in advance.
E95-1028.txt,58,Morphophonological interactions may be quite complex_comma_ and the purpose of morphological processing is to derive syntactic and semantic analyses from words and vice versa for the purpose of full NLP.
E95-1028.txt,59,Reasonably quick compilation is required_comma_ and run time speed need only be moderate.
E95-1028.txt,60,3.1 Compiling Spelling Patterns Compilation of individual spell rules is straightforward feature specifications are compiled to positional boolean format_comma_ characters and occurrences of character classes are also converted to boolean vectors_comma_ and left contexts are reversed cf Abrahamson_comma_ 1992 for efficiency.
E95-1028.txt,63,We therefore take the following approach.
E95-1028.txt,64,First_comma_ all legal sequences of morphemes are produced by top down nondeterministic application of the production rules Section 2.2 _comma_ selecting affixes but keeping the root morpheme unspecified because_comma_ as explained above_comma_ the lexicon is undetermined at this stage.
E95-1028.txt,65,For example_comma_ for English_comma_ the sequences ed ly and un ing are among those produced_comma_ the asterisk representing the unspecified root.
E95-1028.txt,66,Then_comma_ each sequence_comma_ together with any associated restrictions on orthographic features_comma_ undergoes analysis by the compiled spelling rules Section 2.1 _comma_ with the surface sequence and the root part of the lexical sequence initially uninstantiated.
E95-1028.txt,67,Rules are applied recursively and nondeterministically_comma_ somewhat in the style of Abramson 1992 _comma_ taking advantage of Prolog s unification mechanism to instantiate the part of the surface string corresponding to affixes and to place some spelling constraints on the start and or end of the surface and or lexical forms of the root.
E95-1028.txt,68,This process results in a set of spelling palterns_comma_ one for each distinct application of the spelling rules to each affix sequence suggested by the production rules.
E95-1028.txt,69,A spelling pattern consists of partially specified surface and lexical root character sequences fully specified surface and lexical affix sequences_comma_ orthographic feature constraints associated with the spelling rules and affixes used_comma_ and a pair of syntactic category specifications derived from the production rules used.
E95-1028.txt,70,One category is for the root form_comma_ and one for the inflected form.
E95-1028.txt,71,Spelling patterns are indexed according to the surface for analysis and lexical for generation affix characters they involve.
E95-1028.txt,72,At run time_comma_ an inflected word is analysed nondeterministically in several stages_comma_ each of which may succeed any number of times including zero. stripping off possible surface affix characters in the word and locating a spelling pattern that they index matching the remaining characters in the word against the surface part of the spelling pattern_comma_ thereby_comma_ through shared variables_comma_ instantiating the characters for the lexical part to provide a possible root spelling checking any orthographic feature constraints on that root finding a lexical entry for the root_comma_ by any of a range of mechanisms including lookup in the system s own lexicon_comma_ querying an external lexical database_comma_ or attempting to guess an entry for an undefined word and unifying the root lexical entry with the root category in the spelling pattern_comma_ thereby_comma_ through variable sharing with the other category in the pattern_comma_ creating a fully specified category for the inflected form that can be used in parsing.
E95-1028.txt,73,In generation_comma_ the process works in reverse_comma_ starting from indexes on the lexical affix characters.
E95-1028.txt,74,3.2 Representing Lexical Roots Complications arise in spelling rule application from the fact that_comma_ at compile time_comma_ neither the lexical nor the surface form of the root_comma_ nor even its length_comma_ is known.
E95-1028.txt,75,It would be possible to hypothesize all sensible lengths and compile separate spelling patterns for each.
E95-1028.txt,76,However_comma_ this would lead to many times more patterns being produced than are really necessary.
E95-1028.txt,77,Lexical and_comma_ after instantiation_comma_ surface strings for the unspecified roots are therefore represented in a more complex but less redundant way as a structure L1 ... Lm v L_comma_ R R1 ... R_comma_.
E95-1028.txt,78,Here the Li s are variables later instantiated to single characters at the beginning of the root_comma_ and L is a variable_comma_ which is later instantiated to a list of characters_comma_ for its continuation.
E95-1028.txt,79,Similarly_comma_ the s represent the end of the root_comma_ and R is the continuation this time reversed leftwards into the root from the R1.
E95-1028.txt,80,The v L_comma_ R structure is always matched specially with a Kleene star of 205 the default spelling rule.
E95-1028.txt,81,For full generality and minimal redundancy_comma_ Lm and R1 are constrained not to match the default rule_comma_ but the other Li s and Ri s may.
E95-1028.txt,82,The values of n required are those for which_comma_ for some spelling rule_comma_ there are k characters in the target lexical string and n k from the beginning of the right context up to but not including a boundary symbol.
E95-1028.txt,83,The lexical string of that rule may then match R1_comma_..._comma_Rk_comma_ and its right context match Rk l_comma_..._comma_ Rn_comma_ _comma_.... The required values of m may be calculated similarly with reference to the left contexts of rules.
E95-1028.txt,84,2 During rule compilation_comma_ the spelling pattern that leads to the run time analysis of chore given above is derived from m 0 and n 2 and the specified rule sequence_comma_ with the variables R1 R2 matching as in Figure 4.
E95-1028.txt,85,3.3 Applying Obligatory Rules In the absence of a lexical string for the root_comma_ the correct treatment of obligatory rules is another problem for compilation.
E95-1028.txt,86,If an obligatory rule specifies that lexical X must be realised as surface Y when certain contextual and feature conditions hold_comma_ then a partitioning where X is realised as something other than Y is only allowed if one or more of those conditions is unsatisfied.
E95-1028.txt,87,Because of the use of boolean vectors for both features and characters_comma_ it is quite possible to constrain each partitioning by unifying it with the complement of one of the conditions of each applicable obligatory rule_comma_ thereby preventing that rule from applying.
E95-1028.txt,88,For English_comma_ with its relatively simple inflectional spelling changes_comma_ this works well.
E95-1028.txt,89,However_comma_ for other languages_comma_ including French_comma_ it leads to excessive numbers of spelling patterns_comma_ because there are many obligatory rules with non trivial contexts and feature specifications.
E95-1028.txt,90,For this reason_comma_ complement unification is not actually carried out at compile time.
E95-1028.txt,91,Instead_comma_ the spelling patterns are augmented with the fact that certain conditions on certain obligatory rules need to be checked on certain parts of the partitioning when it is fully instantiated.
E95-1028.txt,92,This slows down runtime performance a little but_comma_ as we will see below_comma_ the speed is still quite acceptable.
E95-1028.txt,93,3.4 Timings The compilation process for the entire rule set takes just over a minute for a fairly thorough de2Alternations in the middle of a root_comma_ such as umlaut_comma_ can be handled straightforwardly by altering the root affix pattern from L1... Lm v L_comma_R R1...R_comma_ to L1...Lm v L_comma_R M v L _comma_R R1...Rn_comma_ with M forbidden to be the default rule.
E95-1028.txt,94,This has not been necessary for the descriptions developed so far_comma_ but its implementation is not expected to lead to any great decrease in run time performance_comma_ because the nondeterminism it induces in the lookup process is no different in kind from that arising from alternations at root affix boundaries. scription of French inflectional morphology_comma_ running on a Sparcstation 10 41 SPECint92 52.6 .
E95-1028.txt,95,Run time speeds are quite adequate for full NLP_comma_ and reflect the fact that the system is implemented in Prolog rather than say C and that full syntactico semantic analyses of sentences_comma_ rather than just morpheme sequences or acceptability judgments_comma_ are produced.
E95-1028.txt,96,Analysis of French words using this rule set and only an in core lexicon averages around 50 words per second_comma_ with a mean of 11 spelling analyses per word leading to a mean of 1.6 morphological analyses the reduction being because many of the roots suggested by spelling analysis do not exist or cannot combine with the affixes produced .
E95-1028.txt,97,If results are cached_comma_ subsequent attempts to analyse the same word are around 40 times faster still.
E95-1028.txt,98,Generation is also quite acceptably fast_comma_ running at around 100 Words per second it is slightly faster than analysis because only one spelling_comma_ rather than all possible analyses_comma_ is sought from each call.
E95-1028.txt,99,Because of the separation between lexical and morphological representations_comma_ these timings are essentially unaffected by in core lexicon size_comma_ as full advantage is taken of Prolog s built in indexing.
E95-1028.txt,100,Development times are at least as important as computation times.
E95-1028.txt,101,A rule set embodying a quite comprehensive treatment of French inflectional morphology was developed in about one person month.
E95-1028.txt,102,The English spelling rule set was adapted from Ritchie e al 1992 in only a day or two.
E95-1028.txt,103,A Polish rule set is also under development_comma_ and Swedish is planned for the near future.
E95-1028.txt,104,4 Some Examples To clarify further the use of the formalism and the operation of the mechanisms_comma_ we now examine several further examples.
E95-1028.txt,105,4.1 Multiple letter spelling changes Some obligatory spelling changes in French involve more than one letter.
E95-1028.txt,106,For example_comma_ masculine adjectives and nouns ending in eau have feminine counterparts ending in elle beau nice becomes belle_comma_ chameau camel becomes chamelle.
E95-1028.txt,107,The final e is a feminizing affix and can be seen as inducing the obligatory spelling change au II.
E95-1028.txt,110,Then the partitionings given in Figure 6 will be the only possible ones.
E95-1028.txt,111,For b6j_comma_ the change_6_o rule must apply_comma_ because the chngo feature for b6j is unspecified and therefore can take any value for zb however_comma_ the rule is prevented from applying by the feature clash_comma_ and so the default rule is the only one that can apply.
E95-1028.txt,112,5 Debugging the Rules The debugging tools help in checking the operation of the spelling rules_comma_ either 1 in conjunction with other constraints or 2 on their own.
E95-1028.txt,114,This is useful in checking over and undergeneration.
E95-1028.txt,115,It is also possible to view the spelling patterns and production rule tree used to produce a form for chore_comma_ the trace slightly simplified here is as in figure 7.
E95-1028.txt,116,The spelling pattern 194 referred to here is the one depicted in a different form in Figure 4.
E95-1028.txt,117,The notation clmnprstv A denotes a set of possible consonants represented by the variable A_comma_ which also occurs on the right hand side of the rule_comma_ indicating that the same selection must be made for both occurrences.
E95-1028.txt,118,Production rule tree 17 is that for a single application of the rule adjp_adjp_fem_comma_ which describes the feminine form of the an adjective_comma_ where the root is taken to be the masculine form.
E95-1028.txt,119,The Root and Infl lines show the features that differ between the root and inflected forms_comma_ while the Both line shows those that they share.
E95-1028.txt,120,Tree 18_comma_ which is also pointed to by the spelling pattern_comma_ describes the feminine forms of nouns analogously.
E95-1028.txt,121,For case 2 _comma_ the spelling rules may be applied directly_comma_ just as in rule compilation_comma_ to a specified surface or lexical character sequence_comma_ as if no 207 Surface b o j e Lexical b 6 j e Rule def.
E95-1028.txt,122,c_6_o_comma_ def. bdy. def. bdy.
E95-1028.txt,123,Surface z b 6 j e Lexicah z b 6 j e Rule def. def. def. def. bdy. def. bdy.
E95-1028.txt,124,Figure 6 Feature dependent dropping of accent chbre has root chef with pattern 194 and tree 17.
E95-1028.txt,126,Feature constraints_comma_ and cases where the rules will not apply if those constraints are broken_comma_ are shown.
E95-1028.txt,127,For the lexical sequence cher e _comma_ for example_comma_ the output is as follows.
E95-1028.txt,128,Surface chbre  Lexical chef .
E95-1028.txt,130,Suffix e breaks This indicates to the user that if chef is given a lexical entry consistent with the constraint cdouble n_comma_ then only the first analysis will be valid otherwise_comma_ only the second will be. 6 Conclusions and Further Work The rule formalism and compiler described here work well for European languages with reasonably complex orthographic changes but a limited range of possible affix combinations. Development_comma_ compilation and run time efficiency are quite acceptable_comma_ and the use of rules containing complex feature augmented categories allows morphotactic behaviours and non segmentM spelling constraints to be specified in a way that is perspicuous to linguists_comma_ leading to rapid development of descriptions adequate for full NLP. The kinds of non linear effects common in Semitic languages_comma_ where vowel and consonant patterns are interpolated in words Kay_comma_ 1987 Kiraz_comma_ 1994 could be treated efficiently by the mechanisms described here if it proved possible to define a representation that allowed the parts of an inflected word corresponding to the root to be separated fairly cleanly from the parts expressing the inflection.
E95-1028.txt,131,The latter could then be used by a modified version of the current system as the basis for efficient lookup of spelling patterns which_comma_ as in the current system_comma_ would allow possible lexical roots to be calculated.
E95-1028.txt,132,Agglutinative languages could be handled ef208 flciently by the current mechanism if specifications were provided for the affix combinations that were likely to occur at all often in real texts.
E95-1028.txt,133,A backup mechanism could then be provided which attempted a slower_comma_ but more complete_comma_ direct application of the rules for the rarer cases.
E95-1028.txt,134,The interaction of morphological analysis with spelling correction Carter_comma_ 1992 Oflazer_comma_ 1994 Bowden_comma_ 1995 is another possibly fruitful area of work.
E95-1028.txt,135,Once the root spelling patterns and the affix combinations pointing to them have been created_comma_ analysis essentially reduces to an instance of affixstripping_comma_ which would be amenable to exactly the technique outlined by Carter 1992 .
E95-1028.txt,136,As in that work_comma_ a discrimination net of root forms would be required however_comma_ this could be augmented independently of spelling pattern creation_comma_ so that the flexibility resulting from not composing the lexicon with the spelling rules would not be lost.

M98-1003.txt,5,The criteria used for comparing these two tasks included the vocabulary size_comma_ the average sentence length_comma_ the average number of sentences per text_comma_ the number of texts_comma_ etc. 5BSundheim 1993 5D.
M98-1003.txt,6,The organizers of MUC 6 did not attempt to compare the di 0Eculty of the MUC 6 task to the previous MUC tasks saying that 5Cthe problem of coming up with a reasonable_comma_ objectiveway of measuring relative task di 0Eculty has not been adequately addressed 5BSundheim 1995 5D.

M98-1003.txt,10,De 0Cnitions Network A network consists of a collection of nodes interconnected by an accompanying set of arcs.
M98-1003.txt,11,Each node denotes an object and each arc represents a binary relation between the objects.

M98-1003.txt,13,Figure 1 shows a sample network for the following piece of text 5CThe Extraditables_comma_ or the Armed Branch of the Medellin Cartel have claimed responsibility for the murder of two employees of Bogota s daily El Espectador on Nov 15.
M98-1003.txt,14,The murders took place in Medellin.
M98-1003.txt,15,The Level of A Fact The level of a fact_comma_ F_comma_ in a piece of text is de 0Cned by the following algorithm 1.
M98-1003.txt,16,Build a network_comma_ S_comma_ for the piece of text.
M98-1003.txt,18,Suppose the fact_comma_ F_comma_ consists of several nodes fx 1 x 2  x n g.
M98-1003.txt,19,Let s be the partial network consisting of the set of nodes fx 1 x 2  x n ginterconnected by the set of arcs ft 1 t 2  t k g.
M98-1003.txt,20,We de 0Cne the level of the fact_comma_ F_comma_ with respect to the network_comma_ S_comma_ to be equal to k_comma_ the number of arcs linking the nodes which comprise the fact F.
M98-1003.txt,21,Observations Given the de 0Cnition of the level of a fact_comma_ the following observations can be made 0F Thelevelofafact isrelatedtothe conceptof 5Csemanticvicinity de 0Cned bySchubertet al. 5BSchubert 1979 5D.
M98-1003.txt,22,The semantic vicinity ofanodeinanetwork consists of the nodes and the arcs reachable from that node by traversing a small number of arcs.
M98-1003.txt,23,The fundamental assumption used here is that 5Cthe knowledge required to perform an intellectual task generally lies in the semantic vicinity of the concepts involved in the task 5BSchubert 1979 5D.
M98-1003.txt,24,The level of a fact is equal to the number of arcs that one needs to traverse to reach all the concepts 28nodes 29 which comprise the fact of interest.
M98-1003.txt,25,2 0F A level 0 fact consists of a single node 28i.e. no transitions 29 in a network.
M98-1003.txt,26,0F A level k fact is a union of k level 1 facts.
M98-1003.txt,27,0F Conjunctions 2Fdisjunctions increase the level of a fact.
M98-1003.txt,28,0F The higher the level of a fact_comma_ the harder it is to extract it from a piece of text.
M98-1003.txt,29,0F A fact appearing at one level in a piece of text may appear at some other level in the same piece of text.
M98-1003.txt,30,0F The level of a fact in a piece of text depends on the granularity of the network constructed for that piece of text.
M98-1003.txt,31,Therefore_comma_ the level of a fact with respect to a network built at the word level 28i.e. words represent objects and the relationships between the objects 29 will be greater than the level of a fact with respect to a network built at the phrase level 28i.e. noun groups represent objects while verb groups and preposition groups represent the relationships between the objects 29.
M98-1003.txt,32,Examples Let S be the network shown in Figure 1.
M98-1003.txt,33,S has been built at the phrase level.
M98-1003.txt,34,0F The city mentioned_comma_ in S_comma_ is an example of a level 0 fact because the 5Ccity fact consists only of one node 5CMedellin. 0F The type of attack_comma_ in S_comma_ is an example of a level 1 fact.
M98-1003.txt,35,We de 0Cne the type of attack in the network to be an attack designator suchas 5Cmurder_comma_ 5Cbombing_comma_ or 5Cassassination with one modi 0Cer giving the victim_comma_ perpetrator_comma_ date_comma_ location_comma_ or other information.
M98-1003.txt,36,In this case the type of attack fact is composed of the 5Cthe murder and the 5Ctwo employees nodes and their connector.
M98-1003.txt,37,This makes the type of attack a level 1 fact.
M98-1003.txt,38,The type of attack could appear as a level 0 fact as in 5Cthe Medellin bombing 28assuming that the network is built at the phrase level 29 because in this case both the attack designator 28bombing 29 and the modi 0Cer 28Medellin 29 occur in the same node.
M98-1003.txt,39,The type of attack fact occurs as a level 2 fact in the following sentence 28once again assuming that the network is built at the phrase level 29 5C10 people were killed in the o 0Bensive which included several bombings. In this case there is no direct connector between the attack designator 28several bombings 29 and its modi 0Cer 2810 people 29.
M98-1003.txt,40,They are connected by the intermediatory 5Cthe o 0Bensive node thereby making the type of attack a level 2 fact.
M98-1003.txt,41,The type of attack can also appear at higher levels.
M98-1003.txt,42,0F In S_comma_ the date of the murder of the two employees is an example of a level 2 fact.
M98-1003.txt,43,This is because the attack designator 28the murder 29 along with its modi 0Cer 28two employees 29 account for one level and the arc to 5CNov 15 accounts for the second level.
M98-1003.txt,44,The date of the attack_comma_ in this case_comma_ is not a level 1 fact 28because of the two nodes 5Cthe murder and 5CNov 15 29 because the phrase 5Cthe murder on Nov 15 does not tell one that an attack actually took place.
M98-1003.txt,45,The article could have been talking about a seminar on murders that took place on Nov15and not about the murder of two employees which took place then.
M98-1003.txt,46,0F In S_comma_ the location of the murder of the two employees is an example of a level 2 fact.
M98-1003.txt,47,The exact same argument as the date of the murder of the two employees applies here.
M98-1003.txt,48,0F The complete information_comma_ in S_comma_ about the victims is an example of a level 2 fact because to know that two employees of Bogota s Daily El Espectador were victims_comma_ one has to know that they were murdered.
M98-1003.txt,49,The attack designator 28the murder 29 with its modi 0Cer 28two employees 29 accounts for one level_comma_ while the connector between 5Ctwo employees and 5CBogota s Daily El Espectador accounts for the other.
M98-1003.txt,50,3 0F Similarly_comma_ the complete information_comma_ in S_comma_ about the perpetrators of the murder of the two employees is an example of a level 5 fact.
M98-1003.txt,51,The breakup of the 5 levels is as follows the fact that two employees were murdered accounts for one level the fact that 5CThe Extraditables have claimed responsibility for the murders accounts for two additional levels and the fact that the Extraditables are the 5Carmed branch of the Medellin Cartel account for the remaining two levels.
M98-1003.txt,52,Justi 0Ccation of the Methodology The level of a fact quanti 0Ces the 5Cspread in the information that makes up the fact.
M98-1003.txt,53,Therefore_comma_ the higher the level of a fact_comma_ the greater is the 5Cspread in the information that makes up the fact.
M98-1003.txt,54,This means that more processing has to be done to identify and link all the individual pieces of information that makeup the fact.
M98-1003.txt,55,In fact_comma_ an exploratory study done by Beth Sundheim during MUC 3 showed 5Ca degradation in correctness of message processing as the information distribution in the message became more complex_comma_ that is_comma_ as slot 0Clls were drawn from larger portions of the message 5BHirschman 1992 5D.
M98-1003.txt,56,An argument can be made that there are other factors_comma_ apart from the spread of information_comma_ which in 0Duence the di 0Eculty of extracting a fact from text.
M98-1003.txt,57,Some of these factors include the amount of training done on an information extraction system_comma_ the quality of training_comma_ and the frequency of occurrence of the patterns that a system has been trained on.
M98-1003.txt,58,While these factors do in 0Duence the performance of an information extraction system and they do give some indication as to how di 0Ecult it was for a particular system to extract the fact_comma_ they do not give a system independentway of determining the complexity of extracting the fact.
M98-1003.txt,59,In 5BHirschman 1992 5D_comma_ Lynette Hirschman proposed the following hypothesis there are facts that are simply harder to extract_comma_ across all systems.
M98-1003.txt,60,Based on our de 0Cnition of the level of a fact_comma_ we analyzed the performances of several information extraction systems on the MUC 4 terrorist reports domain.
M98-1003.txt,61,Our analysis shows that all the systems consistently did muchworse on higher level facts.
M98-1003.txt,62,In addition to con 0Crming Hirschman s hypothesis_comma_ the analysis also shows that higher level facts are indeed harder to extract.
M98-1003.txt,63,5BBagga 1998 5D gives the complete details about the analysis.
M98-1003.txt,64,Building the Networks As mentioned earlier_comma_ the level of a fact for a piece of text depends on the network constructed for the text.
M98-1003.txt,65,Since there is no unique network corresponding to a piece of text_comma_ care has to be taken so that the networks are built consistently.
M98-1003.txt,66,For the set of experiments described in the rest of the paper we used the following algorithm to build the networks 1.
M98-1003.txt,67,Every article was broken up into a non overlapping sequence of noun groups 28NGs 29_comma_ verb groups 28VGs 29_comma_ and preposition groups 28PGs 29.
M98-1003.txt,68,The rules employed to identify the NGs_comma_ VGs_comma_ and PGs were almost the same as the ones employed by SRI s FASTUS system 1 .
M98-1003.txt,70,The nodes of the network consisted of the NGs while the transitions between the nodes consisted of the VGs and the PGs.
M98-1003.txt,72,Identi 0Ccation of coreferent nodes and prepositional phrase attachments were done manually.
M98-1003.txt,73,Obviously_comma_ if one were to employ a di 0Berent algorithm for building the networks_comma_ one would get di 0Berent numbers for the level of a fact.
M98-1003.txt,74,But_comma_ if the algorithm were employed consistently across all the facts of interest and across all articles in a domain_comma_ the numbers on the level of a fact would be consistently di 0Berent and one would still be able to analyze the relative complexity of extracting that fact from a piece of text in the domain.
M98-1003.txt,75,1 We wish to thank Jerry Hobbs of SRI for providing us with the rules of their partial parser.
M98-1003.txt,76,4 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Percentage of Facts Levels Facts vs Levels MUC 7 All Facts Figure 2 MUC 7 Level Distribution of the Facts Combined Analysis of the MUC 7 Domain Based on our de 0Cnition of the level of a fact_comma_ we analyzed the MUC 7 domain which consisted of reports on air vehicle launches.
M98-1003.txt,77,We selected a set of standard facts from the o 0Ecial MUC 7 template that we felt captured most of the information in the template.
M98-1003.txt,78,This set consists of 0F Launch Date_comma_ Launch Site 0F Mission Type_comma_ Mission Function_comma_ Mission Status 0F Vehicle_comma_ Vehicle Type_comma_ Vehicle Owner_comma_ Vehicle Manufacturer 0F Payload_comma_ Payload Type_comma_ Payload Function_comma_ Payload Owner 0F Payload Manufacturer_comma_ Payload Origin_comma_ Payload Target_comma_ Payload Recipient Using the algorithm described in the previous section_comma_ we built the networks for 32 of the 64 relevant articles in the 100 article MUC 7 test set.
M98-1003.txt,79,From the network for each article_comma_ we calculated the level of each of the standard facts mentioned in the article.
M98-1003.txt,80,The standard facts appeared 619 times in the 32 articles analyzed.
M98-1003.txt,81,Figure 2 shows the level distribution of all the standard facts.
M98-1003.txt,82,In addition_comma_ Figures 3_comma_ 4_comma_ 5_comma_ and 6 show the level distributions of each of the standard facts.
M98-1003.txt,83,Figures 4 and 5 show that the curves for the Vehicle and the Vehicle Type facts_comma_ and the Payload and Payload Type facts are nearly the same.
M98-1003.txt,84,The main reason being that the phrases 28in the text 29 which describe the vehicles and the payloads_comma_ in most cases_comma_ also mention their types.
M98-1003.txt,85,For example_comma_ the phrase 5CLong March 3B Rocket describes the air launchvehicle and also mentions its type.
M98-1003.txt,86,The Vehicle Owner and Manufacturer facts_comma_ and the Payload Owner and Manufacturer facts all occur at higher levels than the Vehicle and the Payload facts indicating that they are harder to extract.
M98-1003.txt,87,The Payload recipient fact appears to be the most complex fact occurring most frequently at level 9 28Figure 6 29.
M98-1003.txt,88,Evaluating the Di 0Eculty of the MUC 7 Domain We extended our analysis to analyze the di 0Eculty of understanding a text in the MUC 7 domain.
M98-1003.txt,89,Obviously_comma_ the di 0Eculty of understanding a text in a domain depends directly on the expected level of a fact in that domain.
M98-1003.txt,90,We de 0Cne this expected level of a fact in a domain to be the domain number of the domain.
M98-1003.txt,91,The domain number is measured in level units 28LUs 29.
M98-1003.txt,92,Two domains can therefore be compared on the basis of their domain numbers.
M98-1003.txt,93,5 0 10 20 30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of Facts Levels Facts vs Levels Launch Date Launch Site Mission Type Mission Function Mission Status Figure 3 MUC 7 Level Distribution of Each of the Facts 0 10 20 30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of Facts Levels Facts vs Levels Vehicle Vehicle Type Vehicle Owner Vehicle Manufacturer Figure 4 MUC 7 Level Distribution of Each of the Facts The formula used to calculate the domain number is P 1 l 0 l 03 x l P 1 l 0 x l where x l is the number of times one of the standard facts appeared at level l in the articles of the domain.
M98-1003.txt,94,Based on the levels of the standard facts in the MUC 7 test set_comma_ we calculated the domain number of the air vehicle launch domain to be 2.44 LUs.
M98-1003.txt,95,The fact that the domain number of this domain is greater than 2 is to be expected given the fact that most curves in Figures 3_comma_ 4_comma_ 5_comma_ and 6 peak at level 2 or higher.
M98-1003.txt,96,Analysis of MUC 4 The MUC 4 domain consisted of articles reporting terrorist activities in Latin America.
M98-1003.txt,97,Based on the o 0Ecial MUC 4 template_comma_ we selected a set of standard facts that we felt captured most of the information in the template.
M98-1003.txt,98,They are 28The full de 0Cnition of each fact is not included here. 29 6 0 10 20 30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of Facts Levels Facts vs Levels Payload Payload Type Payload Function Payload Owner Figure 5 MUC 7 Level Distribution of Each of the Facts 0 10 20 30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number of Facts Levels Facts vs Levels Payload Manufacturer Payload Origin Payload Target Payload Recipient Figure 6 MUC 7 Level Distribution of Each of the Facts 0F The type of attack.
M98-1003.txt,99,0F The date of the attack.
M98-1003.txt,100,0F The location of the attack.
M98-1003.txt,101,0F The victim 28including damage to property 29.
M98-1003.txt,102,0F The perpetrator 28s 29 28including suspects 29.
M98-1003.txt,103,We then built the networks 28using the algorithm described earlier 29 for the relevant articles from the MUC 4 TST3 set of 100 articles.
M98-1003.txt,104,From the network for each article_comma_ we calculated the levels of each of the 0Cve standard facts.
M98-1003.txt,105,The level distribution of the 0Cve facts for the MUC 4 TST3 set is shown in Figure 7.
M98-1003.txt,106,The level distribution of the 0Cve facts combined is shown in Figure 8.
M98-1003.txt,107,Based on the data collected above_comma_ we made the following observations 7 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Number of Facts Levels Attack Fact Date Fact Location Fact Victim Fact Perpetrator Fact Figure 7 MUC 4 Level Distribution of Each of the FiveFacts 0F There were 69 relevant articles in the MUC 4 TST3 set of 100 articles_comma_ each reporting one or more terrorist attacks.
M98-1003.txt,108,0F The 0Cve facts of interest appeared 570 times in the 69 articles.
M98-1003.txt,109,0F Anumber of articles reported the same fact at two di 0Berent places and at two di 0Berent levels in the same article.
M98-1003.txt,110,The 0Crst_comma_ usually_comma_ in the 0Crst paragraph of the text which reported the attack without giving too many details_comma_ and_comma_ the second_comma_ later in the article when the attackwas reported with all the details.
M98-1003.txt,111,As one would expect_comma_ the level of the 0Crst occurrence of a fact in an article is usually less than or equal to the level of the second occurrence of that fact in the same article.
M98-1003.txt,112,0F From Figure 8_comma_ we can see that almost 50 25 of the 0Cve facts were at level 1.
M98-1003.txt,113,This is not surprising because four out of the 0Cve standard facts most frequently occur as level 1 facts 28Figure 7 29.
M98-1003.txt,114,0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage of Facts Levels 5 Facts combined Figure 8 MUC 4 Level Distribution of the FiveFacts Combined 8 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Number of Facts Levels Parents of JV Child Venture Location of Child Product Percentage Ownership Figure 9 MUC 5 Level Distribution of Each of the FiveFacts Based on the levels of the 0Cve standard facts in the MUC 4 TST3 set of articles_comma_ we calculated the domain number of the terrorist domain to be 1.87 LUs.
M98-1003.txt,115,We are assuming the fact that the set of 100 randomly chosen articles in the MUC 4 TST3 set are representative of the domain.
M98-1003.txt,116,This assumption may not necessarily hold_comma_ but_comma_ given the large number of articles we analyzed_comma_ we hope that the domain number calculated is close to the actual domain number of the terrorist domain.
M98-1003.txt,117,Analysis of MUC 5 Because two di 0Berent domains were used in MUC 5 28each in two di 0Berent languages 29_comma_ we decided to focus only on the English JointVentures 28EJV 29 domain.
M98-1003.txt,118,Once again_comma_ the set of standard facts were selected from the o 0Ecial MUC 5 template and were chosen such that they contained most of the information in the template.
M98-1003.txt,119,They are 28The full de 0Cnition of each fact is not included here. 29 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage of Facts Levels MUC 5 5 Facts Figure 10 MUC 5 Level Distribution of the FiveFacts Combined 9 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Number of Facts Levels Succession Event Organization Succession Event Title s Person In Hired From Person Out Old Person Going To Figure 11 MUC 6 Level Distribution of Each of the Six Facts 0F The parent 28s 29 of the jointventure formed.

M98-1003.txt,122,0F Product that the child will produce.
M98-1003.txt,123,0F Percentage ownership of each parent.
M98-1003.txt,124,Due to the unavailability of the o 0Ecial test set used for the MUC 5 EJV evaluation_comma_ we used a set of 50 articles used by the systems for training on the EJV domain.
M98-1003.txt,125,Using the algorithm described earlier_comma_ we then built the networks for the relevant articles.
M98-1003.txt,126,Out of the 50 articles_comma_ 47 were relevant and the 0Cve standard facts appeared 209 times in these articles.
M98-1003.txt,127,The level distribution of each of the 0Cve facts is shown in Figure 9.
M98-1003.txt,128,The level distribution of the 0Cve facts combined is shown in Figure 10.
M98-1003.txt,129,Based on Figure 9 one can deduce that the MUC 5 EJV domain is harder than the MUC 4 terrorist domain because three out of the 0Cve standard facts most frequently occur as level 2 facts.
M98-1003.txt,130,Figure 10 peaks at level 2 giving further indication that the domain number for this domain is more than 2 LUs.
M98-1003.txt,131,Based on the levels of the standard set of facts_comma_ we calculated the domain numberoftheMUC 5 EJV domain to be 2.67 LUs.
M98-1003.txt,132,This domain number is almost 1 LU higher than the domain number for the MUC 4 terrorist attack domain and it indicates that the MUC 5 EJV task was much harder than the MUC 4 task.
M98-1003.txt,133,In comparison_comma_ an analysis done by Beth Sundheim_comma_ using the features described earlier_comma_ shows that the nature of the MUC 5 EJV task is approximately twice as hard as the nature of the MUC 4 task 5BSundheim 1993 5D.
M98-1003.txt,134,Analysis of MUC 6 The domain used for MUC 6 consisted of articles regarding changes in corporate executive management personnel.
M98-1003.txt,135,As in the case of our analyses of the previous two MUCs_comma_ we selected a set of standard facts based on the o 0Ecial MUC 6 template.
M98-1003.txt,136,This set consisted of the following facts 28The full de 0Cnition of each fact is not included here. 29 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Percentage of Facts Levels MUC 6 6 Facts Figure 12 MUC 6 Level Distribution of the Six Facts Combined MUC Domain Domain Numbers 28in LUs 29 Highest P R F Measure MUC 4 Terrorist Attacks 1.87 55.93 25 MUC 5 JointVentures 2.67 52.75 25 MUC 6 Changes in ManagementPersonnel 2.47 56.40 25 MUC 7 Air Vehicle Launch Reports 2.44 Figure 13 Domain Numbers of MUC 4_comma_ MUC 5_comma_ MUC 6_comma_ and MUC 7 0F Organization where the change 28s 29 in the personnel took place.

M98-1003.txt,141,0F The company 2Fpost that the person going out is going to.
M98-1003.txt,142,We analyzed the levels of the standard set of facts in the o 0Ecial MUC 6 test set by building the networks for the relevant articles in the test set 28using the algorithm described earlier 29.
M98-1003.txt,143,This test set consisted of 100 articles_comma_ 56 of whichwere relevant.
M98-1003.txt,144,The six standard facts appeared 478 times in the relevant articles.
M98-1003.txt,145,The level distribution of each of these six facts is shown in Figure 11.
M98-1003.txt,146,The level distribution of these six facts combined is shown in Figure 12.
M98-1003.txt,147,We calculated the domain number for the MUC 6 domain to be 2.47 LUs.
M98-1003.txt,148,Our analysis therefore indicates that the MUC 6 domain is almost as hard as the MUC 5 EJV domain.
M98-1003.txt,149,Comparing the MUC Information Extraction Tasks Figure 13 shows the domain numbers for the MUC tasks that have been analyzed.
M98-1003.txt,150,For each of the MUCs_comma_ the 0Cgure also shows the highest P R F Measure achieved by a system 28for the information extraction task 29.
M98-1003.txt,151,Our analysis clearly separates the MUC 4 task from the later ones.
M98-1003.txt,152,The tasks for the later MUCs_comma_ however_comma_ have surprisingly similar complexity pro 0Cles 20 to 30 25 percent level 1 facts_comma_ substantially higher level 2 facts_comma_ and decreasing values for higher level facts.
M98-1003.txt,153,Given that the analysis has been only done for 4 tasks_comma_ we do not want to infer too much from the di 0Berence between the complexities of the MUC 5 task and the MUC 6 and the MUC 7 tasks 28whichhave roughly the same complexities 29.
M98-1003.txt,154,Conclusion 11 The level of a fact with respect to a network for a piece of text provides a new method of classifying a fact based on the degree of syntactic complexity related to a fact.
M98-1003.txt,155,This classi 0Ccation tries to quantify the complexity of the syntax that holds the information in text.
M98-1003.txt,156,Moreover_comma_ studies based upon this classi 0Ccation scheme indicate that there is a correlation between the level of a fact and the di 0Eculty of its extraction.
M98-1003.txt,157,The analysis of the degree of di 0Eculty of understanding a text in a domain comes as a by product of our approach and is a big step up from some of the techniques used earlier.
M98-1003.txt,158,This measure is just the beginning of a search for useful complexity measures.
M98-1003.txt,159,Despite its shortcomings_comma_ the current measure does quantify complexity on one very important dimension_comma_ namely the number of clauses 28or phrases 29 required to specify a fact.
M98-1003.txt,160,For the short term it appears to be the best available vehicle for understanding the complexity of extracting a fact as shown in this paper.

M98-1003.txt,162,The author also thanks Beth Sundheim for providing him with the o 0Ecial data from MUC 4_comma_ MUC 5_comma_ and MUC 6.
M98-1003.txt,163,The author was supported byaFellowship from IBM Corporation. .
M98-1009.txt,1,MUC 7_comma_ BBN has for the first time fielded a fully trained system for NE_comma_ TE_comma_ and TR results are all the output of statistical language models trained on annotated data_comma_ rather than programs executing handwritten rules. Such trained systems have some significant advantages They can be easily ported to new domains by simply annotating data with semantic answers. The complex interactions that make rule based systems difficult to develop and maintain can here be learned automatically from the training data.
M98-1009.txt,2,We believe that the results in this evaluation are evidence that such trained systems_comma_ even at their current level of development_comma_ can perform roughly on a par with rules hand tailored by experts.
M98-1009.txt,3,Since MUC 3_comma_ BBN has been steadily increasing the proportion of the information extraction process that is statistically trained.
M98-1009.txt,4,Already in MET 1_comma_ our name finding results were the output of a fully statistical_comma_ HMM based model_comma_ and that statistical Identifinder model was also used for the NE task in MUC 7.
M98-1009.txt,5,For the MUC 7 TE and TR tasks_comma_ BBN developed SIFT_comma_ a new model that represents a significant further step along this path_comma_ replacing PLUM_comma_ a system requiring handwritten patterns_comma_ with SIFT_comma_ a single integrated trained model.
M98-1009.txt,6,SIFT AN INTEGRATED TE TR EXTRACTION SYSTEM .
M98-1009.txt,7,At the sentence level_comma_ the SIFT system Statistics for Information From Text employs a unified statistical process to map from words to semantic structures.
M98-1009.txt,8,That is_comma_ part of speech determination_comma_ namefinding_comma_ parsing_comma_ and relationship finding all happen as part of the same process.
M98-1009.txt,9,This allows each element of the model to influence the others_comma_ and avoids the assembly line trap of having to commit to a particular part of speech choice_comma_ say_comma_ early on in the process_comma_ when only local information is available to inform the choice.
M98-1009.txt,10,The SIFT sentence level model was trained from two sources General knowledge of English sentence structure was learned from the Penn Treebank corpus of one million words of Wall Street Journal text. Specific knowledge about how the target entities and relations are expressed in English was learned from about 500 K words of on domain text annotated with named entities_comma_ descriptors_comma_ and semantic relations.
M98-1009.txt,11,For extraction in a new domain_comma_ the names and descriptors of relevant items persons_comma_ organizations_comma_ locations_comma_ and artifacts are marked_comma_ as well as the target relationships between them that are signaled syntactically.
M98-1009.txt,12,For example_comma_ in the phrase GTE Corp. of Stamford _comma_ the annotation would record a 2 location of connection between the company and the city.
M98-1009.txt,13,The model can thus learn the structures that are typically used in English to convey the target relationships.
M98-1009.txt,14,While the bulk of the TE TR task happens within the sentence level decoder_comma_ some further processing was still required to produce TE and TR answer templates.
M98-1009.txt,15,After the names_comma_ descriptors_comma_ and local relationships had been extracted from the decoder output_comma_ a merging process had to be applied to link multiple occurrences of the same name or of alternative forms of the name from different sentences.
M98-1009.txt,16,A second_comma_ cross sentence model was then invoked to try to identify non local relationships that were missed by the decoder_comma_ as when the two entities do not occur in the same sentence.
M98-1009.txt,17,Finally_comma_ type and country information was filled in using heuristic tests and a gazetteer database_comma_ and output filters were applied to select which of the proposed internal structures should be included in the output.
M98-1009.txt,18,We are actively exploring ways to integrate these post processing steps more closely with the main model_comma_ since an integrated statistical model is the only way to make every choice in a nuanced way_comma_ based on all the available information.
M98-1009.txt,19,Sentence Level Model Figure 1 is a block diagram of the sentence level model showing the main components and data paths.
M98-1009.txt,20,Two types of annotations are used to train the model semantic annotations for learning about the target entities and relations_comma_ and syntactic annotations for learning about the general structure of English.
M98-1009.txt,21,From these annotations_comma_ the training program estimates the parameters of a unified statistical model that accounts for both syntax and semantics.
M98-1009.txt,22,Later_comma_ when presented with a new sentence_comma_ the search program explores the statistical model to find the most likely combined semantic and syntactic interpretation. training program search program statistical model semantic annotations syntactic annotations Penn Treebank combined semanticsyntactic interpretations training decoding sentences Figure 1 Block diagram of sentence level model.
M98-1009.txt,23,Training Data Our source for syntactically annotated training data was the Penn Treebank Marcus et al._comma_ 1993 .
M98-1009.txt,24,Significantly_comma_ we do not require that syntactic annotations be from the same source_comma_ or cover the same domain_comma_ as the target task.
M98-1009.txt,25,For example_comma_ while the Penn Treebank consists of Wall Street Journal text_comma_ the target source for this evaluation was New York Times newswire.
M98-1009.txt,26,Similarly_comma_ although the Penn Treebank domain covers general and financial news_comma_ the target domain for this evaluation was space technology.
M98-1009.txt,27,The ability to use syntactic training from a different source and domain than the target is an important feature of our model.
M98-1009.txt,28,Since the Penn Treebank serves as our syntactically annotated training corpus_comma_ we need only create a semantically annotated corpus.
M98-1009.txt,29,Stated generally_comma_ semantic annotations serve to denote the entities and relations of interest in the target domain.
M98-1009.txt,30,More specifically_comma_ entities are marked as either names or 3 descriptors_comma_ with co reference between entities marked as well.
M98-1009.txt,31,Figure 2 shows a semantically annotated fragment of a typical sentence.
M98-1009.txt,32,From only these simple semantic annotations_comma_ the system can be trained to work in a new domain.
M98-1009.txt,33,To train SIFT for MUC 7_comma_ we annotated approximately 500_comma_000 words of New York Times newswire text_comma_ covering the domains of air disasters and space technology.
M98-1009.txt,34,We have not yet run experiments to see how performance varies with more less training data. Nance _comma_ who a consultantis to NewsABCpaidalso _comma_ said ... person person descriptor organization coreference employeerelation Figure 2 An example of semantic annotation.
M98-1009.txt,35,Semantic Syntactic Structure While our semantic annotations are quite simple_comma_ the internal model of sentence structure is substantially more complicated_comma_ since it must account for syntactic structure as well as entities and semantic relations.
M98-1009.txt,36,Our underlying training algorithm requires examples of these internal structures in order to estimate the parameters of the unified semantic syntactic model.
M98-1009.txt,37,However_comma_ we do not wish to incur the high cost of annotating parse trees.
M98-1009.txt,38,Instead_comma_ we use the following multi step training procedure_comma_ exploiting the Penn Treebank 1 Train the sentence level model on the purely syntactic parse trees in the Treebank.
M98-1009.txt,39,Once this step is complete_comma_ the model will function as a state of the art statistical parser.
M98-1009.txt,40,2 For each sentence in the semantically annotated corpus a Apply the sentence level model to syntactically parse the sentence_comma_ constraining the model to produce only parses that are consistent with the semantic annotation. b Augment the resulting parse tree to reflect semantic structure as well as syntactic structure.
M98-1009.txt,41,3 Retrain the sentence level model on the augmented parse trees produced in step 2.
M98-1009.txt,42,Once this step is complete_comma_ we have an integrated model of semantics and syntax.
M98-1009.txt,43,Details of the statistical model will be discussed later.
M98-1009.txt,44,For now_comma_ we turn our attention to a constraining the decoder and b augmenting the parse trees with semantic structure.
M98-1009.txt,45,Constraints are simply bracketing boundaries that may not be crossed by any parse constituent.
M98-1009.txt,46,There are two types of constraints hard constraints that cannot be violated under any conditions_comma_ and soft constraints_comma_ that may be violated only if enforcing them would result in no plausible parse.
M98-1009.txt,47,All named entities and descriptors are treated as hard constraints the model is prohibited from producing any structures that would break up these elements.
M98-1009.txt,48,In addition_comma_ we attempt to keep possible appositives together through soft constraints.
M98-1009.txt,49,Whenever there is a co referential relation between two entities that are either adjacent or separated by only a comma_comma_ we posit an appositive and introduce a soft constraint to encourage the parser to keep the elements together.
M98-1009.txt,50,Once a constrained parse is found_comma_ it must be augmented to reflect the semantic structure.
M98-1009.txt,51,Augmentation is a five step process.
M98-1009.txt,52,4 1 Nodes are inserted into the parse tree to distinguish names and descriptors that are not bracketed in the parse.
M98-1009.txt,53,For example_comma_ the parser produces a single noun phrase with no internal structure for Lt.
M98-1009.txt,55,David Edwin Lewis .
M98-1009.txt,56,Additional nodes must be inserted to distinguish the descriptor_comma_ Lt.
M98-1009.txt,57,Cmdr._comma_ and the name_comma_ David Edwin Lewis. 2 Semantic labels are attached to all nodes that correspond to names or descriptors.
M98-1009.txt,58,These labels reflect the entity type_comma_ such as person_comma_ organization or location_comma_ as well as whether the node is a proper name or a descriptor.
M98-1009.txt,59,3 For relations between entities_comma_ where one entity is not a syntactic modifier of the other_comma_ the lowermost parse node that spans both entities is identified.
M98-1009.txt,60,A semantic tag is then added to that node denoting the relationship.
M98-1009.txt,61,For example_comma_ in the sentence Mary Fackler Schiavo is the inspector general of the U.S.
M98-1009.txt,62,Department of Transportation_comma_ a co reference semantic label is added to the S node spanning the name_comma_ Mary Fackler Schiavo_comma_ and the descriptor_comma_ the inspector general of the U.S.
M98-1009.txt,63,Department of Transportation. 4 Nodes are inserted into the parse tree to distinguish the arguments to each relation.
M98-1009.txt,64,In cases where there is a relation between two entities_comma_ and one of the entities is a syntactic modifier of the other_comma_ the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument.
M98-1009.txt,65,For example_comma_ in the phrase Lt.
M98-1009.txt,67,David Edwin Lewis_comma_ a node is inserted to indicate that Lt.
M98-1009.txt,68,Cmdr. is a descriptor for David Edwin Lewis. 5 Whenever a relation involves an entity that is not a direct descendant of that relation in the parse tree_comma_ semantic pointer labels are attached to all of the intermediate nodes.
M98-1009.txt,69,These labels serve to form a continuous chain between the relation and its argument.
M98-1009.txt,70,Figure 3 shows an augmented parse tree corresponding to the semantic annotation in Figure 2.
M98-1009.txt,71,Note that nodes with semantic labels ending in r are MUC reportable names and descriptors.
M98-1009.txt,72,Statistical Model In SIFT s statistical model_comma_ augmented parse trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in Collins 1996_comma_ 1997 .
M98-1009.txt,73,For each constituent_comma_ the head is generated first_comma_ followed by the modifiers_comma_ which are generated from the head outward.
M98-1009.txt,74,Head words_comma_ along with their part of speech tags and features_comma_ are generated for each modifier as soon as the modifier is created.
M98-1009.txt,75,Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words_comma_ as in Weischedel et al. 1993 .
M98-1009.txt,76,We illustrate the generation process by walking through a few of the steps of the parse shown in Figure 3.
M98-1009.txt,77,At each step in the process_comma_ a choice is made from a statistical distribution_comma_ with the probability of each possible selection dependent on particular features of previously generated elements.
M98-1009.txt,78,We pick up the derivation just after the topmost S and its head word_comma_ said_comma_ have been produced.
M98-1009.txt,79,The next steps are to generate in order 1.
M98-1009.txt,80,A head constituent for the S_comma_ in this case a VP.
M98-1009.txt,82,Pre modifier constituents for the S.
M98-1009.txt,83,In this case_comma_ there is only one a PER NP.
M98-1009.txt,85,A head part of speech tag for the PER NP_comma_ in this case PER NNP.
M98-1009.txt,87,A head word for the PER NP_comma_ in this case nance.
M98-1009.txt,89,Word features for the head word of the PER NP_comma_ in this case capitalized.
M98-1009.txt,91,A head constituent for the PER NP_comma_ in this case a PER R NP.
M98-1009.txt,93,Pre modifier constituents for the PER NP.
M98-1009.txt,94,In this case_comma_ there are none.
M98-1009.txt,96,Post modifier constituents for the PER NP.
M98-1009.txt,97,First a comma_comma_ then an SBAR structure_comma_ and then a second comma are each generated in turn.
M98-1009.txt,98,This generation process is continued until the entire tree has been produced.

M98-1009.txt,100,We now briefly summarize the probability structure of the model.
M98-1009.txt,101,The categories for head constituents_comma_ ch_comma_ are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node_comma_ cp P c ch p  _comma_ e.g.

M98-1009.txt,111,However_comma_ because these estimates are too sparse to be relied upon_comma_ they must be smoothed by mixing in lower dimensional estimates.
M98-1009.txt,112,We determine the mixture weights using the Witten Bell smoothing method.

M98-1009.txt,114,More concretely_comma_ it must find the most likely augmented parse tree.
M98-1009.txt,115,Although mathematically the model predicts tree elements in a top down fashion_comma_ we search the space bottom up using a chart based search.
M98-1009.txt,116,The search is kept tractable through a combination of CKY style dynamic programming and pruning of low probability elements.
M98-1009.txt,117,7 Dynamic Programming Whenever two or more constituents are equivalent relative to all possible later parsing decisions_comma_ we apply dynamic programming_comma_ keeping only the most likely constituent in the chart.
M98-1009.txt,118,Two constituents are considered equivalent if 1.
M98-1009.txt,119,They have identical category labels.
M98-1009.txt,121,Their head constituents have identical labels.
M98-1009.txt,123,They have the same head word.
M98-1009.txt,125,Their leftmost modifiers have identical labels.
M98-1009.txt,127,Their rightmost modifiers have identical labels.
M98-1009.txt,128,Pruning Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart_comma_ only those constituents with probabilities within a threshold of the highest scoring constituent are maintained all others are pruned.
M98-1009.txt,129,For purposes of pruning_comma_ and only for purposes of pruning_comma_ the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent Goodman_comma_ 1997 .
M98-1009.txt,130,We can think of this prior probability as an estimate of the probability of generating a subtree with the constituent category_comma_ starting at the topmost node.
M98-1009.txt,131,Thus_comma_ the scores used in pruning can be considered as the product of 1.
M98-1009.txt,132,The probability of generating a constituent of the specified category_comma_ starting at the topmost node.
M98-1009.txt,134,The probability of generating the structure beneath that constituent_comma_ having already generated a constituent of that category.
M98-1009.txt,135,The outcome of the search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence_comma_ so that the TE entities and local TR relations can be directly extracted from these sentential trees.
M98-1009.txt,136,Cross Sentence Model The cross sentence model uses structural and contextual clues to hypothesize template relations between two elements that are not mentioned within the same sentence.
M98-1009.txt,137,Since 80 90 of the relations found in the answer keys connect two elements that are mentioned in the same sentence_comma_ the cross sentence model has a narrow target to shoot for.
M98-1009.txt,138,Very few of the pairs of entities seen in different sentences turn out to be actually related.
M98-1009.txt,139,This model uses features extracted from related pairs in training data to try to identify those cases.
M98-1009.txt,140,It is a classifier model that considers all pairs of entities in a message whose types are compatible with a given relation for example_comma_ a Person and an Organization would suggest a possible Employee_Of.
M98-1009.txt,141,For the three Muc 7 relations_comma_ it turned out to be somewhat advantageous to build in a functional constraint_comma_ so that the model would not consider_comma_ for example_comma_ a possible Employee_Of relation for a person already known from the sentence level model to be employed elsewhere.
M98-1009.txt,142,Given the measured features for a possible relation_comma_ the probability of a relation holding or not holding can be computed as follows    featsp relprelfeatspfeatsrelp     featsp relprelfeatspfeatsrelp If the ratio of those two probabilities_comma_ computed as follows_comma_ is greater than 1_comma_ the model predicts a relation       relprelfeatsp relprelfeatsp featsrelp featsrelp 8 We approximate this ratio by assuming feature independence and taking the product of the contributions for each feature.  i i i i relfeatprelp relfeatprelp featsrelp featsrelp      The cross sentence feature model applies to entities found by the sentence level model_comma_ which is run over all of the sentence like portions of the text. An initial heuristic procedure checks for sections of the preamble or trailer that look like sentential material_comma_ that should be treated like the body text. There is also a separate handwritten procedure that searches the preamble text for any byline_comma_ and_comma_ if one is found_comma_ instantiates an appropriate employee relationship. Model Features Two classes of features were used in this model structural features that reflect properties of the text surrounding .
M98-1017.txt,1,entities form the major components in a document. When we catch the fundamental entities_comma_ we can understand a document to some degree.
M98-1017.txt,2,This paper employs different types of information from different levels of text to extract named entities_comma_ including character conditions_comma_ statistic information_comma_ titles_comma_ punctuation marks_comma_ organization and location keywords_comma_ speech act and locative verbs_comma_ cache and n gram model.
M98-1017.txt,3,In the formal run of MET 2_comma_ the F measures P R_comma_ 2P R and P 2R are 79.61 _comma_ 77.88 and 81.42 _comma_ respectively. .
M98-1017.txt,4,People_comma_ affairs_comma_ time_comma_ places and things are five basic entities in a document.
M98-1017.txt,5,When we catch the fundamental entities_comma_ we can understand a document to some degree.
M98-1017.txt,6,Natural Language Processing Laboratory NLPL in Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering CSIE _comma_ National Taiwan University NTU starts to study named entity extraction problem in 1993.
M98-1017.txt,7,At first_comma_ we focus on the extraction of Chinese person names_comma_ transliterated person names 1 and organization names 2 .
M98-1017.txt,8,The training data and the testing data in these experiments are selected from three Taiwan newspaper corpora China Times_comma_ Liberty Times News and United Daily News .
M98-1017.txt,9,Chen and Lee 3 reported the precision rate and the recall rate for the extraction of Chinese person names_comma_ transliterated person names and organization names are 88.04 _comma_ 92.56 _comma_ 50.62 _comma_ 71.93 and 61.79 _comma_ 54.50 _comma_ respectively in the 16th International Conference on Computational Linguistics.
M98-1017.txt,10,We employ these results to several applications.
M98-1017.txt,11,Chen and Wu 4 considered person names as one of clues in sentence alignment.
M98-1017.txt,12,Chen and Lee 3 show its application to anaphora resolution.
M98-1017.txt,13,Chen and Bian 5 proposed a method to construct white pages for Internet Intranet users automatically.
M98-1017.txt,14,We extract information from World Wide Web documents_comma_ including proper nouns_comma_ E mail addresses and home page URLs_comma_ and find the relationship among these data.
M98-1017.txt,15,Chen_comma_ Ding and Tsai 6_comma_7 dealt with proper noun extraction for information retrieval.
M98-1017.txt,16,In MUC 7 and MET 2_comma_ we attend named entity extraction tasks for both English and Chinese.
M98-1017.txt,17,We extend our previous work on this problem to cover more named entity types such as locations_comma_ date time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions.
M98-1017.txt,18,Several issues have to be addressed during extension.
M98-1017.txt,19,One of the major differences between Chinese and English language processing is that segmentation is required for Chinese.
M98-1017.txt,20,That is_comma_ we have to identify word boundary in Chinese sentences beforehand.
M98-1017.txt,21,That makes Chinese named entity extraction tasks more changeable.
M98-1017.txt,22,Besides_comma_ the vocabulary set and the Chinese coding set used in Taiwan and in China are not the same.
M98-1017.txt,23,The documents adopted in MET 2 are selected from newspapers in China_comma_ thus we have to transform simplified Chinese characters in GB coding set to traditional Chinese characters in Big 5 coding set before testing.
M98-1017.txt,24,A word that is known may become unknown due to transformation.
M98-1017.txt,25,For example_comma_ the character GFA in G87GFA early morning is used in traditional Chinese characters.
M98-1017.txt,26,However_comma_ G44 is used in simplified Chinese characters and it is also a legal traditional Chinese character that denotes another meaning.
M98-1017.txt,27,In other words_comma_ the mapping from GB to Big5 is G87G44 _comma_ which is an unknown word based on our dictionary.
M98-1017.txt,28,The different vocabulary set between China and Taiwan results in different segmentation.
M98-1017.txt,29,This paper is organized as follows.
M98-1017.txt,30,Section 2 illustrates the flow of named entity extraction and the summary scores of our team in MET 2 formal run.
M98-1017.txt,31,Sections 3_comma_ 4 and 5 propose methods to extract named people_comma_ organizations and locations.
M98-1017.txt,32,Section 6 deals with the rest of named entities_comma_ i.e._comma_ date time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions.
M98-1017.txt,33,After each section_comma_ we discuss the sources of errors in the formal run.
M98-1017.txt,34,Section 7 concludes the remarks.
M98-1017.txt,35,FLOW OF NAMED ENTITY EXTRACTION The following shows the flow of named entity extraction in MET 2 formal run.
M98-1017.txt,36,1 Transform Chinese texts in GB codes into texts in Big 5 codes.
M98-1017.txt,37,2 Segment Chinese texts into a sequence of tokens.
M98-1017.txt,38,2 3 Identify named people.
M98-1017.txt,39,4 Identify named organizations.
M98-1017.txt,40,5 Identify named locations.
M98-1017.txt,41,6 Use n gram model to identify named organizations locations.
M98-1017.txt,42,7 Identify the rest of named expressions.
M98-1017.txt,43,8 Transform the results in Big 5 codes into the results in GB codes.
M98-1017.txt,44,Steps 1 and 2 form the preprocessing of the named entity extraction tasks.
M98-1017.txt,45,As mentioned in Section 1_comma_ Big 5 traditional character set and GB simplified character set are adopted in Taiwan and in China_comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,46,Our system is developed on the basis of Big 5 codes_comma_ so that the transformation of the official documents in MET 2 into the documents in terms of Big 5 codes is necessary.
M98-1017.txt,47,Characters used both in simplified character set and tradition character set always result in error mapping.
M98-1017.txt,48,For example_comma_ G0AG66 vs. G0AGD5_comma_ G4BGDB vs. G4BG67_comma_ G1FG4C vs. G1FGD6_comma_ G4EG2D vs. G4EG9E_comma_ G8EGEB vs. G88GEB_comma_ G57GC3G79 vs. GF9GC3G79_comma_ G6AG93GFA vs. G8EG93GFA_comma_ GC6G0BGCBG30 vs. GC6G0BGCBG51_comma_ GEAGB4 vs. GEAG94_comma_ G8EG24 vs. G8EGA1_comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,49,A Chinese sentence is composed of a sequence of characters without any word boundary.
M98-1017.txt,50,Step 2 tries to identify words on the basis of a dictionary and segmentation strategies.
M98-1017.txt,51,We list all the possible words by dictionary look up_comma_ and then resolve ambiguities by segmentation strategies.
M98-1017.txt,52,Our dictionary is trained from CKIP corpus 8 _comma_ of which articles are collected from Taiwan newspapers_comma_ magazines_comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,53,The vocabulary used in MET 2 documents may be different from the vocabulary trained from Taiwan corpora_comma_ so that more unknown words are introduced.
M98-1017.txt,54,For example_comma_ G8AGB7GACG74 vs. G8AGB7GACGBF _comma_ GE3G46 vs. GE3GB0 _comma_ GA2 G42GB5 vs. G5CG42GB5 _comma_ GA4G5C vs. GA4G64G5C _comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,55,That will interfere with the named entity extraction because named entities are often unknown words too.
M98-1017.txt,56,Table 1 summarizes the results of MET 2 formal run of our team.
M98-1017.txt,57,The F measures in terms of P R_comma_ 2P R_comma_ and P 2R are 79.61 _comma_ 77.88 and 81.42 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,58,The recall rate and the precision rate object scores for the extraction of name_comma_ time and number expressions are 85 _comma_ 79 _comma_ 91 _comma_ 98 and 95 _comma_ 85 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,59,We will discuss the major errors for each type of named entities.
M98-1017.txt,60,NAMED PEOPLE EXTRACTION The naming methods are totally different for Chinese person names and transliterated person names.
M98-1017.txt,61,The following two subsections deal with each of them.
M98-1017.txt,62,Identification of Chinese Person Names Chinese person names are composed of surnames and names.
M98-1017.txt,63,Most Chinese surnames are single character and some rare ones are two characters.
M98-1017.txt,64,The following shows three different types 1 Single character like GEA _comma_ GA9 _comma_ GC1 and GEC .
M98-1017.txt,65,2 Two characters like GB2GD1 and G99GCB .
M98-1017.txt,66,3 Two surnames together like G26GB1 .
M98-1017.txt,67,Most names are two characters and some rare ones are single characters.
M98-1017.txt,68,Theoretically_comma_ every character can be considered as names rather than a fixed set.
M98-1017.txt,69,Thus the length of Chinese person names ranges from 2 to 6 characters.
M98-1017.txt,70,Three kinds of recognition strategies are adopted 1 name formulation rules 2 context clues_comma_ e.g._comma_ titles_comma_ positions_comma_ speech act verbs_comma_ and so on 3 cache Name formulation rules form the baseline model.
M98-1017.txt,71,It proposes possible candidates.
M98-1017.txt,72,The context clues add extra scores to the candidates.
M98-1017.txt,73,Cache records the occurrences of all the possible candidates in a paragraph.
M98-1017.txt,74,If a candidate appears more than once_comma_ it has high tendency to be a person name.
M98-1017.txt,75,The following illustrates each strategy in details.
M98-1017.txt,76,Name formulation rules are trained from a person name corpus in Taiwan 9 .
M98-1017.txt,77,It contains 1 million Chinese person names.
M98-1017.txt,78,Each contains surname_comma_ name and sex.
M98-1017.txt,79,During training_comma_ we divide the corpus into two partitions according to sex of persons.
M98-1017.txt,80,In our method_comma_ we postulate that the formulation of names is different for male and female.
M98-1017.txt,81,At first_comma_ we get 598 surnames from this 1M person name corpus_comma_ and then compute the probabilities of these characters to be surnames.
M98-1017.txt,82,Of these_comma_ surnames of very low frequency like G79 _comma_ G4E _comma_ etc._comma_ are removed from this set to avoid too much false alarms.
M98-1017.txt,83,Only 541 surnames are left_comma_ and are used to trigger the person name identification system.
M98-1017.txt,84,Next_comma_ the probability of a Chinese character to be the first character the second character of a name is computed for male and female_comma_ separately.

M98-1017.txt,86,We consider the above three types of surnames.
M98-1017.txt,88,Single character 4 i P C 1 P C 2 P C 3 using male training table Threshold 1 and P C 2 P C 3 using male training table Threshold 2 _comma_ or ii P C 1 P C 2 P C 3 using female training table Threshold 3 and P C 2 P C 3 using female training table Threshold 4 Model 2.
M98-1017.txt,89,Two characters i P C 2 P C 3 using male training table Threshold 2 _comma_ or ii P C 2 P C 3 using female training table Threshold 4 Model 3.
M98-1017.txt,90,Two surnames together P C 12 P C 2 P C 3 using female training table Threshold 3 _comma_ P C 2 P C 3 using female training table Threshold 4 and P C 12 P C 2 P C 3 using female training table P C 12 P C 2 P C 3 using male training table where C 1 _comma_ C 2 and C 3 are a continuous sequence of characters in a sentence_comma_ and they denote surname and names_comma_ respectively_comma_ C 11 and C 12 denote the first and the second surnames_comma_ P C i is the probability of C i to be a surname or a name.
M98-1017.txt,91,For different types of surnames_comma_ different models are adopted.
M98-1017.txt,92,Because the surnames with two characters are always surnames_comma_ Model 2 neglects the score of surname part.
M98-1017.txt,93,Both Models 1 and 3 consider the score of surname.
M98-1017.txt,94,We compute the probabilities using female and male training tables_comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,95,In Models 1 and 2 _comma_ either male score or female score must be greater than thresholds.
M98-1017.txt,96,In Model 3 _comma_ the person names must denote a female.
M98-1017.txt,97,In this case_comma_ the probability to be female must be greater than the probability to be male.
M98-1017.txt,98,The above three models can be extended to the single character names.
M98-1017.txt,99,When a candidate cannot pass the thresholds_comma_ its last character is cut off and the remaining string is tried again.
M98-1017.txt,100,Thresholds are trained from the 1 million person name corpus.
M98-1017.txt,101,We let 99 of the training data pass the thresholds.
M98-1017.txt,102,Besides the baseline model_comma_ titles_comma_ positions and special verbs are important local clues.
M98-1017.txt,103,When a title such as G6BG84 President appears before after a string_comma_ it is probably a person name.
M98-1017.txt,104,There are 476 titles in our database.
M98-1017.txt,105,Person names usually appear at the head or the tail of a sentence.
M98-1017.txt,106,Persons may be accompanied with speech act verbs like G1EG39 _comma_ GDC _comma_ G93G37 _comma_ etc. For these cases_comma_ extra scores are added to help strings pass the thresholds.
M98-1017.txt,107,Finally_comma_ we present a global clue.
M98-1017.txt,108,A person name may appear more than once in a document.
M98-1017.txt,109,We use cache to store the identified candidates and reset cache when next document is considered.
M98-1017.txt,110,There are four cases shown below when cache is used 1 C 1 C 2 C 3 and C 1 C 2 C 4 are in the cache_comma_ and C 1 C 2 is correct.
M98-1017.txt,111,2 C 1 C 2 C 3 and C 1 C 2 C 4 are in the cache_comma_ and both are correct.
M98-1017.txt,112,3 C 1 C 2 C 3 and C 1 C 2 are in the cache_comma_ and C 1 C 2 C 3 is correct.
M98-1017.txt,113,4 C 1 C 2 C 3 and C 1 C 2 are in the cache_comma_ and C 1 C 2 is correct.
M98-1017.txt,114,Cases 1 and 2 cases 3 and 4 are contradictory.
M98-1017.txt,115,In our treatment_comma_ a weight is assigned to each entry in the cache.
M98-1017.txt,116,The entry that has clear right boundary has a high weight.
M98-1017.txt,117,Titles_comma_ positions_comma_ and special verbs are clues for boundary.
M98-1017.txt,118,For those similar pairs that have different weights_comma_ the entry having high weight is selected.
M98-1017.txt,119,If both have high weights_comma_ both are chosen.
M98-1017.txt,120,When both have low weights_comma_ the score of the second character of a name part is critical.
M98-1017.txt,121,It determines if the character is kept or deleted.
M98-1017.txt,122,Identification of Transliterated Person Names Transliterated person names denote foreigners.
M98-1017.txt,123,Compared with Chinese person names_comma_ the length of transliterated names is not restricted to 2 to 6 characters.
M98-1017.txt,124,The following strategies are adopted to recognize transliterated names 1 transliterated name set The transliterated names trained from MET data are regarded as a built in name set.
M98-1017.txt,125,2 character condition Two special character sets are retrieved from MET training data_comma_ Hornby 10 and Huang 11 .
M98-1017.txt,126,The first character of transliterated names must belong to a 280 character set_comma_ and the remaining characters must appear in a 411 character set.
M98-1017.txt,127,The character condition is a loose restriction.
M98-1017.txt,128,The string that satisfies the character condition may denote a location_comma_ a building_comma_ an address_comma_ etc. It should be employed with other clues refer to 3 5 .
M98-1017.txt,129,3 titles Titles used in Chinese person names are also applicable to transliterated person names.
M98-1017.txt,130,Thus_comma_ GFA G01G5A GD4 will not be recognized as a transliterated person name.
M98-1017.txt,131,4 name introducers Some words like G52 _comma_ G52G59 _comma_ G52G31 _comma_ GD3G52 _comma_ and G5EG77 can introduce transliterated names when 5 they are used at the first time.
M98-1017.txt,132,5 special verbs Persons always appear with some special verbs like G1EGBB _comma_ G5DG99 _comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,133,Thus the same set of verbs used in Chinese person names are also used for transliterated person names.
M98-1017.txt,134,Besides the above strategies_comma_ a complete transliterated person name is composed of first name_comma_ middle name and last name.
M98-1017.txt,135,For example_comma_ GCAG94GF0G43GEFGFAG15G54GEFGCAG51GEFGB2G28G05G42.
M98-1017.txt,136,The first_comma_ middle and last names are connected by a dot.
M98-1017.txt,137,Cache mechanism is also helpful in the identification of transliterated names.
M98-1017.txt,138,A candidate that satisfies the character condition and one of the clues will be placed in the cache.
M98-1017.txt,139,At the second time_comma_ the clues may disappear_comma_ but we can recover the transliterated person name by checking cache.
M98-1017.txt,140,The following shows an example G26GE1G56G5BGCB GEB G26GE1G56GD9GB8 Title does not show up_comma_ when the name is mentioned again.
M98-1017.txt,141,Discussion The summary report in Table 1 shows the recall rate and the precision for person names are 91 and 74 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,142,The major errors are listed below 1 segmentation In our treatment_comma_ segmentation is done before named entity extraction.
M98-1017.txt,143,Part of person names may be regarded as words during segmentation.
M98-1017.txt,144,The following show some examples.
M98-1017.txt,145,The characters GEAGC5 _comma_ G26GC1 _comma_ and G67G1F are common content words.
M98-1017.txt,146,GEAGC5G5B GEAGC5 G5B GF7G26GC1 GF7 G26GC1 G67G1FG33 G67G1F G33 In this case_comma_ the person name is missed.
M98-1017.txt,147,2 surname set and character set Those characters not listed in surname set are not considered as surnames_comma_ so that they cannot trigger our identification system.
M98-1017.txt,148,The characters G2C and G15 in person names G2CG02G3C and G15 GE1G0D are typical examples.
M98-1017.txt,149,Similarly_comma_ if the character of a transliterated person name does not belong to the predefined character set_comma_ the character will be neglected.
M98-1017.txt,150,For example_comma_ GCF in G43G05 GCFG0AGF2 is not listed in the character set_comma_ and the scope error happens.
M98-1017.txt,151,3 blanks Blank may appear between surname and name in the original MET 2 documents_comma_ e.g._comma_ GDC GDB .
M98-1017.txt,152,After segmentation_comma_ blanks are also inserted between words.
M98-1017.txt,153,We cannot tell if the blanks exist in the original documents or are inserted by our segmentation system.
M98-1017.txt,154,4 boundary errors Some Chinese person names are mis regarded as transliterated names_comma_ e.g._comma_ G8CG63G8D G8CG63 G4FG42G6A G4FG42 5 titles Titles are important clues for the identification of transliterated person names.
M98-1017.txt,155,Even if a transliterated name satisfies the character condition_comma_ it is not identified without title.
M98-1017.txt,156,The name G43 GDB in the string G6BG8AG43GDB is missed because G6BG8A is not listed in our title set.
M98-1017.txt,157,6 Japanese names The current version cannot deal with Japanese names like G8DGC4G76GFEGAE .
M98-1017.txt,158,NAMED ORGANIZATION EXTRACTION Extraction Algorithm The structure of organization names is more complex than that of person names.
M98-1017.txt,159,Basically_comma_ a complete organization name can be divided into two parts_comma_ i.e._comma_ name and keyword.
M98-1017.txt,160,The following specifies the rules we adopted to formulate its structure.
M98-1017.txt,161,OrganizationName GC6 OrganizationName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g._comma_ G7BGD4G66 GF4GCE OrganizationName GC6 CountryName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g._comma_ G04G66 GACG63GCB OrganizationName GC6 PersonName OrganizationNameKeyword e.g._comma_ GDCG74GF2 G6EGC5G65 6 OrganizationName GC6 CountryName D DD OrganizationNameKeyword where D is a content word. e.g._comma_ GC4G66 G66G15 G6DG95G94G57 OrganizationName GC6 PersonName D D OrganizationNameKeyword e.g._comma_ GDCG74GF2 G05GE9 G6EGC5G65 OrganizationName GC6 LocationName D D OrganizationNameKeyword e.g._comma_ G57G3E G66G15 G6DG95G94G57 OrganizationName GC6 CountryName OrganizationName e.g._comma_ G04G66 G66G52GF4 OrganizationName GC6 LocationName OrgnizationName e.g._comma_ GA9G6AG84GF7 GF7GE3 In current version_comma_ we collect 776 organization names and 1059 organization name keywords.
M98-1017.txt,162,Transliterated person names and location names in the above rules still have to satisfy the character condition mentioned in last section.
M98-1017.txt,163,However_comma_ the character set is trained from transliterated person name corpus.
M98-1017.txt,164,It may not be suitable for location names.
M98-1017.txt,165,Consider an example GDDG95GA8GE2G0AG66G42G2EGEF .
M98-1017.txt,166,GDDG95GA8 GE2 _comma_ which is a lake in China_comma_ is not a transliterated name.
M98-1017.txt,167,The characters G95 and GA8 do not belong to the character set.
M98-1017.txt,168,Here_comma_ we utilize the feature of multiple occurrences of organization names in a document and propose n gram model to deal with this problem.
M98-1017.txt,169,Although cache mechanism and n gram use the same feature_comma_ i.e._comma_ multiple occurrences_comma_ their concepts are totally different.
M98-1017.txt,170,For organization names_comma_ we are not sure when a pattern should be put into cache because its left boundary is hard to decide.
M98-1017.txt,171,In our n gram model_comma_ we select those patterns that meet the following criteria 1 It must consist of a name and an organization name keyword.
M98-1017.txt,172,2 Its length must be greater than 2 words.
M98-1017.txt,173,3 It does not cross sentence boundary and any punctuation marks.
M98-1017.txt,174,4 It must occur at lease two times.
M98-1017.txt,175,Discussion Table 1 shows the recall rate and the precision rate for the extraction of organization names are 78 and 85 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,176,The following shows the error analysis.
M98-1017.txt,177,1 more than two content words between name and keyword In current version_comma_ we accept only two interference words.
M98-1017.txt,178,Thus_comma_ the string GC4G66 G38G7A G1EGCB G2D G52 GDDG50 is not recognized.
M98-1017.txt,179,2 absent of keywords Keywords are important indicators for right boundary.
M98-1017.txt,180,The string GFAG35G5BG1AG9CG4AG2F is lack of keyword_comma_ so it is missed.
M98-1017.txt,181,3 absent of name part Name part serves as an indicator of left boundary.
M98-1017.txt,182,In the string G5CG7AGDDG50 _comma_ we cannot find a name.
M98-1017.txt,183,4 n gram errors N gram employs multiple occurrences to find a pattern.
M98-1017.txt,184,It is easy to propose false alarms_comma_ e.g._comma_ GE4 GC5G03G40 and GF3GAAG05G4DG36GFBGF4G1EGCBG6EGDD .
M98-1017.txt,185,NAMED LOCATION EXTRACTION Extraction Algorithm The structure of location names is similar to that of organization names.
M98-1017.txt,186,A complete location name is composed of name part and keyword part.
M98-1017.txt,187,We use the following rule to formulate this structure.
M98-1017.txt,188,LocationName GC6 PersonName LocationNameKeyword LocationName GC6 LocationName LocationNameKeyword Currently_comma_ we have 45 location keywords.
M98-1017.txt,189,The following shows some examples GB5 _comma_ GC4GFF _comma_ GDDG58 _comma_ G27G3E _comma_ G27G42 _comma_ G27G36 _comma_ G27GFB _comma_ G41GD5 _comma_ G41G51 _comma_ G68 _comma_ G68GC4GFF _comma_ etc. There are 16_comma_442 built in location names in current versions.
M98-1017.txt,190,For the treatment of location names without keywords_comma_ we also introduce some locative verbs like G67G35 _comma_ GF2GEA _comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,191,The objects following this kind of verbs may be location names.
M98-1017.txt,192,For example_comma_ in the string G5DGEAGFAG58G27GA5 _comma_ GFAG58G27GA5 will be identified.
M98-1017.txt,193,Cache is also useful.
M98-1017.txt,194,For example_comma_ assume GFAG15GD3GA6G68 is recognized as a location name and placed in cache.
M98-1017.txt,195,When GFAG15GD3GA6 appears_comma_ it will be identified as a location name even if the location name keyword is omitted.
M98-1017.txt,196,N gram model is also employed to recover those names that do not meet the character condition.
M98-1017.txt,197,7 Discussion Table 1 shows the recall rate and the precision rate in this part are 78 and 69 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,198,The performance is worse than that of named people and named organization.
M98-1017.txt,199,The major types of errors are shown below.
M98-1017.txt,200,1 character set The characters G13 and GD5 in the string G13G74GD5G53 do not belong to our transliterated character set.
M98-1017.txt,201,Actually_comma_ it denotes a Japanese location name.
M98-1017.txt,202,2 wrong keyword The character GF4 is an organization keyword.
M98-1017.txt,203,Thus the string G6EG4AGE6G24GF4 is misregarded as an organization name.
M98-1017.txt,204,3 common content words The words such as GF3GD1 _comma_ GA9G7A _comma_ etc._comma_ are common content words.
M98-1017.txt,205,We do not give them special tags.
M98-1017.txt,206,4 single character locations The single character locations such as GC4 _comma_ G09 _comma_ and so on_comma_ are missed during recognition.
M98-1017.txt,207,Total 57 errors are of this type.
M98-1017.txt,208,5 interference words between name part and keywords There are words between name part and keywords.
M98-1017.txt,209,For example_comma_ GA4G64G44GC7GF1GC4GFF and GADG54G23 GD6GDBG6FG1EGCBG48 .
M98-1017.txt,210,Here the words GC7GF1 and GDBG6F are common words in China newspaper_comma_ but seldom used in Taiwan.
M98-1017.txt,211,OTHER ENTITY EXTRACTION Extraction Algorithm We use grammar rules to capture the remaining entities_comma_ including date time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions.
M98-1017.txt,212,The following shows the specification of each type of expressions.
M98-1017.txt,213,Each rule is accompanied with an example.

M98-1017.txt,215,We can add_comma_ delete and modify rules quickly without modifying the identification programs.
M98-1017.txt,216,However_comma_ the above rules cannot capture ambiguous cases.
M98-1017.txt,217,For example_comma_ G1D may mean the address number e.g._comma_ GC4GB5G58G87G1D or the date number e.g._comma_ G96G0BG87G1D .
M98-1017.txt,218,Augmented grammar rules are needed to introduce constraints to check if the extracted entity can fit into the context.
M98-1017.txt,219,Discussion The summary report in Table 1 shows that the recall rate and the precision rate for date expression_comma_ time expression_comma_ monetary expression and percentage expression are 94 _comma_ 88 _comma_ 98 _comma_ 70 _comma_ 98 _comma_ 98 and 83 _comma_ 98 _comma_ respectively.
M98-1017.txt,220,The major errors are shown as follows 1 propagation errors Because we employ a segmentation system to identify basic tokens before entity extraction_comma_ some words like G48GD5 _comma_ GD5G4C _comma_ etc._comma_ are regarded as terms.
M98-1017.txt,221,In this way_comma_ GD5 is always missed.
M98-1017.txt,222,Similarly_comma_ named people are extracted before date expressions.
M98-1017.txt,223,The errors resulting from the previous steps propagate to the next steps.
M98-1017.txt,224,Consider the following example.
M98-1017.txt,225,G351998GFAGCAG34GD8GA6 The named people extraction procedure regards GFAGCAG34GD8GA6 as a transliterated name.
M98-1017.txt,226,After that_comma_ 1998GFA is missed because the date unit is absent.
M98-1017.txt,227,2 absent date units In some sentences_comma_ the date unit GFA does not appear_comma_ so that G82G87G87GDB is missed.
M98-1017.txt,228,In some examples like G87G0BG93 _comma_ the date unit should appear but it is absent.
M98-1017.txt,229,Thus it is also not captured.
M98-1017.txt,230,3 absent keywords Some keywords are not listed.
M98-1017.txt,231,For example_comma_ GACGA5GF4G0BGCB _comma_ G36GD5 _comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,232,Thus_comma_ for G99GE8 GACGA5GF4G0BGCB8GF158GE0 and 1960GFAG36GD5 _comma_ only some fragments_comma_ e.g._comma_ G99GE8 _comma_ 8GF158GE0 _comma_ and 1960GFA are identified.
M98-1017.txt,233,4 rule coverage Patterns like GD5GECG2BG76GFA are not considered in this version_comma_ thus they are missed.
M98-1017.txt,234,Similarly_comma_ the percentage expressions like 2 3 _comma_ G89G93GE0GC7G82 _comma_ G24GDBGE0GC7G82 _comma_ and so on_comma_ are not represented in our grammar.
M98-1017.txt,235,5 ambiguity Some characters like GF1 can be used in time and monetary expressions.
M98-1017.txt,236,Expression G93G89GF1G85 G85G30G04GD8 is divided into two parts G93G89GF1 and G85G85G30G04GD8 .
M98-1017.txt,237,Similarly_comma_ the strings G93GE0 and G82G0B are words.
M98-1017.txt,238,In our pipelined model_comma_ G87GF1G93GE0 and G97GE8G82G0B will be missed.
M98-1017.txt,239,CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper proposes a pipeline model to extract named entities from Chinese documents.
M98-1017.txt,240,Different types of information from different levels of text are employed_comma_ including character conditions_comma_ statistic information_comma_ titles_comma_ punctuation marks_comma_ organization and location keywords_comma_ speech act and locative verbs_comma_ cache and n gram model.
M98-1017.txt,241,The context ranges from very short to very long.
M98-1017.txt,242,The recall rate 83 and the precision rate 77 are achieved.
M98-1017.txt,243,The major errors result from propagation errors_comma_ keyword sets_comma_ character sets_comma_ rule coverage_comma_ and so on.
M98-1017.txt,244,How to integrate different modules including segmentation and recognition in an interleaving way_comma_ and how to learn grammar rules_comma_ keyword sets and character sets automatically have to be studied furthermore. .
M98-1005.txt,1,. This mechanism handles search through the net_comma_ use of inference rules to derive implicit facts_comma_ and general output formatting.
M98-1005.txt,2,A template contains a predefined set of slots with associated fill in rules that direct the search for appropriate information in the net.
M98-1005.txt,3,The slot fill in rules are predicates that check node controls_comma_ or use the inference functions available in the core.
M98-1005.txt,4,For more details see 1 .
M98-1005.txt,5,Implementation and Operating Details LOLITA is written mostly in Haskell_comma_ a non strict functional programming language 8 .
M98-1005.txt,6,Two resource critical sections are written in C the parsing algorithm and the SemNet data structure and its access functions.
M98-1005.txt,7,Haskell has some similarity to LISP_comma_ such as building programs by writing functions_comma_ a garbage collected heap_comma_ lists as a basic type_comma_ and full higher order use of functions.
M98-1005.txt,8,However_comma_ it provides excellent support for modern Software Engineering_comma_ such as modularity_comma_ constrained polymorphism_comma_ a strong but flexible type system.
M98-1005.txt,9,It also enforces referential transparency and allows coding in a lazy style_comma_ which means code is not executed unless needed.
M98-1005.txt,10,Thus_comma_ whilst our system has the external appearance of a pipeline architecture_comma_ the evaluation of individual pieces of code need not occur in that strict order.
M98-1005.txt,11,IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT SINCE MUC 6 The system that entered the 6th Message Understanding Conference suffered from three major problems.
M98-1005.txt,12,First_comma_ there was room for improvement in parsing.
M98-1005.txt,13,Second_comma_ the named entity recognition rate was fairly low_comma_ as compared with other systems.
M98-1005.txt,14,Third_comma_ the system contained a series of trivial errors in the code.
M98-1005.txt,15,Altogether_comma_ these three major shortcomings resulted in a considerable drop in performance.
M98-1005.txt,16,In the general approach adopted by the LOLITA project_comma_ every core component plays an important role in the final result.
M98-1005.txt,17,Consequently_comma_ if any of the components is unsatisfactory_comma_ overall performance is affected.
M98-1005.txt,18,This is especially prominent if an early stage of analysis e.g._comma_ parsing is incorrect.
M98-1005.txt,19,Many of the problems encountered during MUC 6 have been addressed and several improvements to the system have been carried out since that time.
M98-1005.txt,20,The most substantial of these improvements are discussed in the remainder of this section.
M98-1005.txt,21,Changes to the Grammar and Parsing Components Parsing can sometimes fail on very large forests decoding these requires a lot of resources time_comma_ memory .
M98-1005.txt,22,Rather than cause a crash due to overrunning limits_comma_ the parse is abandoned.
M98-1005.txt,23,This is implemented by fixing a timelimit on the process resource usage being proportional to time the expiry of the time limit is referred to as a timeout .
M98-1005.txt,24,It is also possible for parses to fail if the sentence can t be analysed with the main grammar.
M98-1005.txt,25,In the system used for MUC 6 if the parse failed then analysis was discontinued on that sentence.
M98-1005.txt,26,This meant that no semantic result was produced and hence no information was available on NE s etc in the sentence.
M98-1005.txt,27,MUC 6 texts which contained sentences that timed out would therefore receive poor scores.
M98-1005.txt,28,For MUC 7 a number of improvements to the parsing mechanism have been adopted_comma_ including a recovery strategy for sentences that failed to parse.
M98-1005.txt,29,LOLITA s grammar has been improved and expanded to allow for a better parsing of the materials used in MUC 6.
M98-1005.txt,30,Furthermore_comma_ a new method for handling headlines in the articles has been added.
M98-1005.txt,31,As well as devising a special grammar for them_comma_ the headlines are now analysed at the end of the article_comma_ using as context the initial sentences of the main body of the text.
M98-1005.txt,32,The parsing mechanism itself has been improved.
M98-1005.txt,33,Island parsing_comma_ whereby easily recognisable noun phrases are locked into units before being passed onto the parser_comma_ has been introduced.
M98-1005.txt,34,This has improved the parsing success rate substantially.
M98-1005.txt,35,Moreover two extra passes have been added should parsing fail a second pass using Brill s tagger 9 and a third pass using a reduced grammar.
M98-1005.txt,36,These are aimed at recovering constituents of complex sentences_comma_ if a full parse isn t possible.
M98-1005.txt,37,Finally_comma_ in cases where all three parsing passes fail_comma_ a way of recovering most named entities_comma_ all the pronouns_comma_ possessive determiners and some noun phrases particularly those related to the topic of the text_comma_ if the latter can be provided in advance has been devised.
M98-1005.txt,38,Changes to the NE Recognition Components The components responsible for named entity recognition have been revised and many new rules have been added.
M98-1005.txt,39,A major change has been introduced to LOLITA s morphology module_comma_ which allows the system to reuse names of entities previously recognised in the preceding text_comma_ rather than treat the entities in each sentence of the incoming text as new.
M98-1005.txt,40,Previously_comma_ the morphology module had no access to the results of the semantic and pragmatic analysis of the preceding text. A change in the treatment of unknown proper names that appear without clear designators i.e._comma_ without Corp_comma_ Ltd_comma_ Mrs._comma_ etc has been introduced.
M98-1005.txt,41,In the MUC 6 system a decision as to what type of entity an unknown name stood for was made early and usually resulted in the conclusion that it must stand for an organisation.
M98-1005.txt,42,The new improved treatment_comma_ on the other hand_comma_ involves the . of the concept of human_or_organisation_comma_ the use of which allows for a delay in the decision_comma_ until some disambiguating information becomes available at the pragmatics stage.
M98-1005.txt,43,For example_comma_ given the following first sentence of an article Shortly after Fossett s launching Monday his competitors sent him telegrams of congratulation The system cannot decide what sort of entity Fosset is on the basis of this name itself.
M98-1005.txt,44,However_comma_ the use of the pronoun his as well as the absence of any other possible referents_comma_ provide the disambiguating clues.
M98-1005.txt,45,Changes to the Semantic and Pragmatic Components At the semantic level_comma_ several new rules that had previously been missing and had been needed to handle expressions common in MUC 6 articles have been added.
M98-1005.txt,46,New rules were also needed due to the .
M93-1026.txt,1,between entities_comma_ and it is up to the discourse interpreter_comma_ with its far richer context_comma_ to decid e what more specific relationship is appropriate . A further weakness that the walkthrough example shows up well is our inability to deal with many objects o f the same type_comma_ notably companies .
M93-1026.txt,2,In the traffic domain_comma_ it was rarely important to distinguish entities beyon d their type_comma_ and so the co reference resolution strategies used are rather eager and arbitrary.
M93-1026.txt,3,Finer control_comma_ and perhaps even backtracking_comma_ is clearly needed here .
M93-1026.txt,4,Finally_comma_ a few words on evaluation .
M93-1026.txt,5,Table 1 gives the results for the final evaluation run_comma_ scoring against the full templates.
M93-1026.txt,6,Table 2 gives the results when scored against the reduced template that was used in the dry ru n test two months before the final run .
M93-1026.txt,7,These figures are noticably better and arguably a better assessment of th e system_comma_ because the reduced template corresponds more closely to the system s abilities .
M93-1026.txt,8,The reason for this i s that the full template included a number of objects and slots not present in the reduced template_comma_ which ou r system never attempted to fill we simply did not have time to develop_comma_ any code to support them .
M93-1026.txt,9,These_comma_ of course_comma_ count as errors in the full template score_comma_ but are ignored in the reduced template scor e s lt is interesting to note here that the walkthrough example alone gave very similar figures_comma_ and so is fairly average for our system UNDERR 78ALL OBJECTS SUB 3859 OVG 25 Max errMin err 0.90620.882 REC PRE 25 46 331 ERROR BASED METRIC SU BERR UND OVG 38ALL OBJECTS 2 35174 RICHNESS NORMALIZED ERROR II Min er r 0 .5311 Max er r 0 .545 7 RECALL AND PRECISIO N RE C 30 PRE 48 P R F Measur e 37 .1 4 Table 2 Reduced Template Score s ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S The research described in this paper would not have been possible but for the generous support of Integral Solutions Ltd ._comma_ Racal Research Ltd._comma_ Sussex University COGS and the Advanced Research Projects Agency _comma_ Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office contract no .

M93-1024.txt,1,removed_comma_ as are author name lines_comma_ and COMLINE tag lines . Sentences that are too short to be interesting are removed .
M93-1024.txt,2,The Tagger Because the input is mixed case in this domain_comma_ and because many of the proper names tha t would normally be unknown to the system lexicon are capitalized_comma_ the MUC 5 LINK syste m uses a pre parse tagger to process and attempt to identify capitalized words which are passe d as strings from the Tokenizer.
M93-1024.txt,3,The Tagger uses heuristics aka hacks to break apart strings i n several different ways.
M93-1024.txt,4,Some of the tags that are used include COMP NAME for things that seem to be obviously company names_comma_ LOCATION for city state pairs_comma_ PERSON NAME for people names if they have Mr_comma_ Mrs_comma_ VP_comma_ Dr in front _comma_ and NAME for other names .
M93-1024.txt,5,Some example rules that the tagger uses are 1.
M93-1024.txt,6,If a word is a known acronym e .g. DRAM or an abbreviation that is normally capitalized e.g. Mbit _comma_ then just pass the word as a regular lexeme .
M93-1024.txt,8,If the string ends in a word like Corp or Co _comma_ tag the string as a company name.
M93-1024.txt,10,If a string is followed by a word like President or Spokesman and then another string _comma_ make the first part a company name and the rest a person name .
M93-1024.txt,12,If a string is followed by a comma and then a state name_comma_ tag it as a city state pai r The Filter Our filtering mechanism allows the system to ignore all sentences which have no useful mean ing.
M93-1024.txt,13,Each sentence in an article is checked to see if it contains at least one word whose meanin g is relevant to the domain if so_comma_ the sentence is passed on to the parsre.
M93-1024.txt,14,Words with relevan t meanings to this domain included verbs indicating the development or purchase of a microelectronics capability e.g._comma_ transfer or use  names of companies or people and various nouns of interest e .g._comma_ device _comma_ hydrofluoric _comma_ temperature and DRAM .
M93-1024.txt,15,The LINK parser LINK is unification based chart parser_comma_ which parses a sentence at a time .
M93-1024.txt,16,The LINK parser applies unification grammar rules to a sentence to generate a syntactic and semantic representation.
M93-1024.txt,17,A set of principled grammar rule application heuristics select which grammar rules t o apply.
M93-1024.txt,18,If these heuristics fail_comma_ we revert to bottom up chart parsing .
M93-1024.txt,19,We will outline the forma t of the grammar and then we will describe our parsing strategy .
M93-1024.txt,20,The LINK grammar LINK s grammar rules are quite similar in form to those used in PATR II Shieber_comma_ 1986 .
M93-1024.txt,21,Semantic information resides mainly in the lexicon_comma_ along the lines of HPSG Pollard and Sag _comma_ 1987 .
M93-1024.txt,22,This organization improves the portability of the system_comma_ since the vast majority o f the grammar should be applicable to other domains_comma_ while the lexicon contains most of th e domain specific information .
M93-1024.txt,23,The integration of syntactic and semantic knowledge into the same grammar formalism i s crucial to our system s ability to process large texts in a reasonable length of time_comma_ and t o producing the semantic analysis used to generate templates .
M93-1024.txt,24,Edges are placed in the chart to represent constituents that the parser identifies.
M93-1024.txt,25,Edges have associated with them both syntactic and semantic information_comma_ represented in the form of a directed acyclic graph DAG .
M93-1024.txt,26,The DAGs correspond to the information in the set of gramma r rules used to build a constituent .
M93-1024.txt,27,The MUC 5 LINK parsing strateg y LINK is a bottom up chart parser which does not use top down constraints .
M93-1024.txt,28,Top down constraints are not used so that as many partial parses as possible can be generated .
M93-1024.txt,29,Because unrestricted bottom up chart parsing can be and is_comma_ in our system very inefficient _comma_ LINK uses heuristics to decide on the next edge to be entered into the chart .
M93-1024.txt,30,Many of the 295 heuristics we use are taken from those suggested in psycholinguistic work e .g._comma_ Ford_comma_ Bresnan_comma_ and Kaplan_comma_ 1982 _comma_ although we found the need to embellish these with additional heuristics o f our own see Huyck and Lytinen_comma_ 1993_comma_ for details .
M93-1024.txt,31,The heuristics are encoded in a rule based system .
M93-1024.txt,32,The rules are invoked each time a new edge is to be entered into the chart_comma_ in case more than one edge could be entered next .
M93-1024.txt,33,Each rule specifies a set of conditions under which a grammar rule should be preferred or unpreferred .
M93-1024.txt,34,Rules may specify several different types of preference levels_comma_ similar to the preferences that ar e used in SOAR Laird_comma_ Rosenbloom_comma_ and Newell_comma_ 1987 .
M93-1024.txt,35,Heuristics may state that one grammar rule is preferable to another under some set of circumstances i .e._comma_ if it is possible to apply both rule a and rule b at this point_comma_ then rule a should be applied _comma_ that a rule is a good candidate _comma_ that it is a bad candidate_comma_ or that it is the best candidate i .e._comma_ under these conditions_comma_ definitely apply this grammar rule .
M93-1024.txt,36,Because the heuristics are incomplete_comma_ often it is the case that_comma_ at some point during th e parse_comma_ they are not able to suggest which rule to apply next .
M93-1024.txt,37,When this occurs_comma_ the syste m performs regular undirected bottom up parsing .
M93-1024.txt,38,This continues until a complete parse of the sentence is found_comma_ no more rules can be applied_comma_ or a maximum time limit is exceeded .
M93-1024.txt,39,If a complete parse is not found_comma_ one or more partial parses is passed on for further processing .
M93-1024.txt,40,No attempt is made to patch together a complete interpretation of the sentence if it is not parse d successfully.
M93-1024.txt,41,The Postprocessor The postprocessor is responsible for assembling the semantic representations of individua l sentences into a coherent representation of the entire article_comma_ and for generating the response template s from this overall representation .
M93-1024.txt,42,Our MUC 5 postprocessor is a two stage_comma_ rulebased system .
M93-1024.txt,43,In the first stage_comma_ the rules transform representations produced by the parser into a cannonical form.
M93-1024.txt,44,Irrelevant portions of the representation are also discarded in this firs t stage.
M93-1024.txt,45,In the second stage_comma_ another set of rules transforms these representations into a for m which much more closely resembles the form of the response templates .
M93-1024.txt,46,A rule consists of a left hand side lhs _comma_ which must match i .e._comma_ unify with the semanti c output from the parser.
M93-1024.txt,47,If the lhs matches_comma_ the representation is converted to the form specifie d in the right hand side rhs .
M93-1024.txt,48,Here are some example rules from the first stage of postprocessing CONVERT report action 1hs report lhs object ACTION rhs  lhs object rhs actor  lhs actor  CONVERT equiv 1hs equiv lhs actor HUMAN lhs actor name customer 296 rhs transfer to custome r rhs recipient  lhs object The first rule converts the representation produced for sentences such as It was reporte d that . . . .
M93-1024.txt,49,If the main predicate representing the sentence is REPORT_comma_ and the reported object i s an ACTION_comma_ then this rule discards the REPORT predicate and replaces it with the ACTION .
M93-1024.txt,50,If the ACTION has no actor_comma_ it is filled in as the actor of the REPORT .
M93-1024.txt,51,Thus_comma_ the transforme d representation of the sentence LSI Logic Corp. reported that they developed . . . becomes DEVELOP_comma_ with the actor filled in as LSI Logic Corp . The second rule transforms the representation of a sentence such as The customer wa s Hampshire Instruments . Whenever the main predicate is EQUIV our semantic representatio n of to be _comma_ and the subject or actor of this action is customer _comma_ this rule converts th e representation to the predicate TRANSFER TO CUSTOMER_comma_ the recipient of which is th e complement object of to be .
M93-1024.txt,52,Together_comma_ these two rules transform the representation of a sentence like The customer is reported to be LSI Logic Corp to the predicate TRANSFERTO CUSTOMER_comma_ the recipient of which is LSI Logic Corp. The postprocessor also merges representations from separate sentences into a single template when appropriate .
M93-1024.txt,53,After the transformation rules are run_comma_ the representations of two sentence s are merged together if they can unify.
M93-1024.txt,54,The resulting single representation is simply the resul t of the unification .
M93-1024.txt,55,If representations of sentences cannot be unified_comma_ then their representation s may produce separate templates in the response .

M93-1024.txt,62,The first sentence mentions Nikon Corp and has other meaningful words the second sentence has the word use and other meaningful words and the third sentence has the word company along with other meaningful words .
M93-1024.txt,63,Quoted strings are further analyzed by the tagger_comma_ to determine what type of object the y are likely to be.
M93-1024.txt,65,NSR 1755EX8A was not in the lexicon_comma_ nor did it have any additional indicators_comma_ s o it was assumed correctly to be a proper name .
M93-1024.txt,66,The string Mbit DRAMs was not tagge d because each word is known to the tagger to be an acronym abbreviation .
M93-1024.txt,67,These words are simply passed along_comma_ and the lexicon provides the appropriate information for them .
M93-1024.txt,68,Before parsing_comma_ the chart for the parser as described below is built adding constituents fo r each word or tagged item.
M93-1024.txt,69,When the parser reads a tagged item from the input sentence_comma_ i t simply makes an entry in the chart at that position with the semantic type corresponding to th e tag and the words contained in the item .
M93-1024.txt,70,For example_comma_ COMP NAME NIKON CORP turn s into an entry with type Company_comma_ and name Nikon Corp .
M93-1024.txt,71,The parser is not successful at completely parsing any of these sentences .
M93-1024.txt,72,This primaril y because the grammar and lexicon are lacking several necessary pieces of information.
M93-1024.txt,73,In the first sentence_comma_ plan is not marked in the lexicon as taking an infinitival complement .
M93-1024.txt,74,Thus_comma_ the construction cannot be parsed .
M93-1024.txt,75,There is also no grammar rule for parsing a determiner followe d by a name as a noun phrase the NSF 1766EX8A .
M93-1024.txt,76,Had this sentence read_comma_ . . . market the NSF 1766EX8A stepper_comma_ the partial parse would have been more complete .
M93-1024.txt,77,As it is_comma_ only th e following information can be extracted from this sentence ENTITY NAME Nikon Corp TYPE COMPANY NAME NAME Nsr 1755ex8a DEVICE FUNCTION DRAM SIZE LENGTH NUM PLURAL VALUE 64 SCALE MBITS EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT_TYPE STEPPER Except for market _comma_ none of the verbs in this sentence were defined in our lexicon a s interesting thus_comma_ none of them are included in the partial parses sent on to the postprocessor .
M93-1024.txt,78,300 Because Nikon Corp and the name of the stepper are not attached to anything_comma_ the post processor does not know where in the final template these should be placed .
M93-1024.txt,79,Thus_comma_ they ar e discarded .
M93-1024.txt,80,STEPPER_comma_ however_comma_ results in the production of a LITHOGRAPHY template_comma_ an d the DRAM is attached as the DEVICE_comma_ resulting in the response shown in figure 2 .
M93-1024.txt,81,No additional information is extracted from sentences 2 and 3 .
M93-1024.txt,82,In sentence 2_comma_ the tex t will have a resolution of 0 .45 micron_comma_ compared to the 0.5 micron of the company s lates t stepper was not parsed well enough for the system to realize that 2 different steppers are bein g described.
M93-1024.txt,83,Granularity specifications were not handled well by the postprocessing rules .
M93-1024.txt,84,Had the granularities been successfully attached to the representations of the two steppers_comma_ the n our system would have produced two different LITHOGRAPHY templates_comma_ because differen t granularities would have caused unification of the two steppers to fail .
M93-1024.txt,85,Thus_comma_ the respons e would have contained two separate templates .
M93-1024.txt,86,However_comma_ the granularities were not successfull y incorporated into the templates_comma_ resulting the steppers being merged into a single template .
M93-1024.txt,87,The final sentence provides another opportunity to identify Nikon Corp as being the MANUFACTURER and DISTRIBUTOR of the LITHOGRAPHY technique .
M93-1024.txt,88,However_comma_ again_comma_ the word price was not defined in our lexicon as a verb relevant to the domain_comma_ so the informatio n was ignored .
M93-1024.txt,89,ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANC E The LINK system s performance on the MUC 5 English microelectronics test set is shown i n figure 4.
M93-1024.txt,90,Our system s performance is relatively precision oriented .
M93-1024.txt,91,We suspect that this is du e to the fact that our approach attempts complete analyses of each sentence .
M93-1024.txt,92,Thus_comma_ information which is extracted is relatively reliable_comma_ while additional information may be missed .

M93-1024.txt,94,In its most conservative setting_comma_ only partial parses whose semantic interpretations involved importan t actions e.g._comma_ DEVELOP_comma_ SELL_comma_ etc. were used in postprocessing .
M93-1024.txt,95,The system could be mad e less conservative by expanding the types of partial parses that were used in tempalte generation .
M93-1024.txt,96,In its least conservative setting_comma_ even single words might be chosen as interesting partial parses _comma_ 301 resulting in the generation of a template .
M93-1024.txt,97,For example_comma_ the appearance of the word CVD could result in the generation of a LAYERING template with TYPE field CVD .
M93-1024.txt,98,For the test run_comma_ we used the system in its least conservative setting .
M93-1024.txt,99,During development testing_comma_ we found that this setting resulted in approximately 50 improvement in recall rate s without adversely affecting precision.
M93-1024.txt,100,We believe that this reflects the English microelectronic s domain.
M93-1024.txt,101,Since the vocabulary used in articles in this domain consisted of a large number of technical terms not normally used in most English texts_comma_ the extraction of information base d on occurrence of these words without analysis of their surrounding context was a relatively saf e thing to do.
M93-1024.txt,102,In other domains_comma_ it is likely that the use of single word partial parses would resul t in significant reduction in precision.
M93-1024.txt,103,Our system s precision results did suffer from the fact that templates were sometimes produced that contained so little information that they could not be matched by the scorer t o answer key templates.
M93-1024.txt,104,These templates were counted by the scorer as spurious_comma_ reducing ou r precision score .
M93-1024.txt,105,We plan to analyze our results further to calculate the system s precision ha d it not produced these unmatchable templates .
M93-1024.txt,106,Of interest is our system s performance on text filtration.
M93-1024.txt,107,The 99 recall_comma_ 75 precision performance is much higher than what might be expected given LINK s overall recall precision rates .
M93-1024.txt,108,We suspect that these results are due to our system s full analysis approach .
M93-1024.txt,109,Our system is far from mature .
M93-1024.txt,110,Due to lack of resources this year_comma_ the total developmen t time for the system totaled only about 6 person months .
M93-1024.txt,111,This represents about 1 3 of the development time of our MUC 4 system .
M93-1024.txt,112,Thus_comma_ the knowledge base of the system is still quit e incomplete.
M93-1024.txt,113,This resulted in the low recall performance of the system .
M93-1024.txt,114,Further development of the knowledge base is likely to greatly improve system performance .
M93-1024.txt,115,System Training We used two specialized techniques to aid in the development of the system knowledge bases .
M93-1024.txt,116,The first was to use the development keys as a sort of pocket dictionary for some of th e important and often used words .
M93-1024.txt,117,We did this by extracting all the slot fillers and their type s from the templates .
M93-1024.txt,118,For all the string fills_comma_ we added the string directly to the dictionary wit h the semantic type that was derived from the slot that it filled .
M93-1024.txt,119,Many of the set fills were also added verbatim to the lexicon_comma_ since in this domain set fills were often technical terms e .g. _comma_ CVD .
M93-1024.txt,120,Other lexicon entries were simply created by either expanding the set fill abbreviations or abbreviating the full text set fills.
M93-1024.txt,121,The other main training source came as a result of the tagger .
M93-1024.txt,122,Since the tagger made it possible to recognize proper names that were not in the lexicon by analyzing strings of capitalize d words_comma_ we used the tagged items to hypothesize new lexicon entries .
M93-1024.txt,123,This was only done fo r items that the tagger was sure of_comma_ like company names strings that ended with Corp _comma_ Co _comma_ Inc _comma_ etc and person names that started with Mrs _comma_ Dr _comma_ VP _comma_ etc . These definitions were not entered directly into the lexicon_comma_ but were put into a separate file so that they could b e reviewed by a knowledge engineer.
M93-1024.txt,124,CONCLUSION 302 Although LINK s performance on the English Microelectronics testset was less then stellar_comma_ it is difficult to draw conclusions about the use of our approach on this domain .
M93-1024.txt,125,The primary reason for degradation of performance as compared to MUC 4 was a lack of resources needed t o develop a proper knowledge base for the domain .
M93-1024.txt,126,Lack of information in the lexicon_comma_ grammar _comma_ and system s domain knowledge resulted in poor analysis of the majority of articles .
M93-1024.txt,127,The system s relatively good performance in precision indicates that our full analysis approach is likely to yield reliable results when information is extracted .
M93-1024.txt,128,However_comma_ the Microelectronics domain may be unusual in the frequency of technical terms which are not commonly use d in general English.
M93-1024.txt,129,Because of this property of the domain_comma_ it appears that techniques relying o n less complete analysis of the text may be appropriate also .
M93-1024.txt,130,Our own experience indicated that the utilization of even partial parses of only a few words or even a single word improved ou r system s recall without damaging precision .
M93-1024.txt,131,We believe that in a domain with a less specialize d vocabulary_comma_ techniques relying on specific keywords would be more likely to degrade precisio n performance. references Ford_comma_ M ._comma_ Bresnan_comma_ J._comma_ and Kaplan.

M93-1011.txt,1,paper describes the GE CMU TIPSTER SHOGUN system as configured for the TIPSTER 24 month MUC 5 benchmark_comma_ and gives details of the system s performance on the selected Japanese and English texts. The SHOGUN system is a distillation of some of the key ideas that emerged from previous benchmarks and experiments_comma_ emphasizing a simple architecture in which the focus is on detailed corpus based knowledge .
M93-1011.txt,2,This design allowed the project to meet its goal of achieving advances in coverage and accuracy while showing consistently good performanc e across languages and domains . .
M93-1011.txt,3,The GE CMU TIPSTER SHOGUN system is the result of a two year research effort_comma_ part of the A1tPA sponsored TIPSTER data extraction program.
M93-1011.txt,4,The project s main goals were 1 to develop algorithm s that would advance the state of the art in coverage and accuracy in data extraction_comma_ and 2 to demonstrat e high performance across languages and domains and to develop methods for easing the adaptation of the system to new languages and domains .
M93-1011.txt,5,The system as used in MUC 5 represents a considerable shift from those used in earlier stages of th e program and in previous MUC s.
M93-1011.txt,6,The original SHOGUN design integrated several different approaches b y combining different knowledge sources_comma_ such as syntax_comma_ semantics_comma_ phrasal rules_comma_ and domain knowledge_comma_ a t run time .
M93-1011.txt,7,This allowed the system to achieve a good level of performance very quickly_comma_ and made it easy t o test different modules and methods however_comma_ it proved very difficult to make all the changes necessary t o improve the system_comma_ especially across languages_comma_ when system knowledge was so distributed at run time .
M93-1011.txt,8,As a result_comma_ the team adopted a new approach_comma_ relying heavily on finite state approximation .
M93-1011.txt,9,This method combines several earlier previous of work_comma_ including Pereira s research on grammar approximation 4 _comma_ som e of the original ideas on parser compilation from Tomita 5 _comma_ and GE s representation of the dynamic lexico n 3_comma_ 1 .
M93-1011.txt,10,Like Pereira s model_comma_ the system uses a finite state grammar as a loose version of a context fre e 1 This research was sponsored in part by the Advanced Research Project Agency DOD and other government agencies .
M93-1011.txt,11,The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representin g the official policies_comma_ either expressed or implied_comma_ of the Advanced Research Project Agency or the US Government .
M93-1011.txt,12,109 grammar_comma_ under the assumption that the finite state grammar will cover all the inputs that the genera l grammar would recognize but perhaps be more tolerant .
M93-1011.txt,13,However_comma_ the system also includes methods fo r compiling different knowledge sources into the finite state model_comma_ particularly emphasizing lexical knowledg e and domain knowledge as reflected in a corpus .
M93-1011.txt,14,This model_comma_ in which knowledge is combined at development time to be used by a finite state patter n snatching engine at run time_comma_ makes it easier to tune the system to a new language or domain withou t sacrificing the benefit of having general linguistic and conceptual knowledge in the system .
M93-1011.txt,15,While the GE systems_comma_ and more recently_comma_ the GE CMU systems_comma_ have done well in all the MUC evaluations_comma_ our rate of progress has never been so great as it has been in the period before MUC 5 .
M93-1011.txt,16,This is in spit e of the fact that_comma_ the team s diagnostic and debugging efforts had to be divided across languages and domain s handling Japanese_comma_ for example_comma_ presented a significant overhead in simply being able to follow the rule s and analyze the results .
M93-1011.txt,17,We attribute this progress to the current focus on facilitating and automating th e knowledge acquisition process_comma_ especially on the use of a corpus.
M93-1011.txt,18,This paper will give a very brief overview of the configuration of the system_comma_ followed by the analysis o f the examples_comma_ and some conclusions about the results .
M93-1011.txt,19,SYSTEM OVERVIE W The TIPSTER SHOGUN system as configured for the 24 month MUC 5 benchmark has roughly the same components as earlier versions of the system_comma_ but the system now performs linguistic analysis entirel y using a finite state pattern matcher_comma_ instead of LR parsing or chart style parsing_comma_ both of which were par t of the configuration in MUC 4 .
M93-1011.txt,20,Figure 1 shows the basic components of the SHOGUN system_comma_ using our own names for modules_comma_ wher e applicable_comma_ along with the labels used in Jerry Hobbs paper The Generic Information Extraction System .
M93-1011.txt,21,The core components of SHOGUN are a subset of the modules that Hobbs describes .
M93-1011.txt,22,However_comma_ the syste m differs from other current extraction systems in the use of the finite state analyzer and the way that corpusbased knowledge is integrated into the lexico syntactic rules .
M93-1011.txt,23,Finite state Sentence Analysis MUC 5 System  parser lexical disambiguation PM3 Syntactic Parsing MUC 4 System Post processing TRUMPImmii LR Parse r text structure zoner NLlex preprocessor PM1 filter English statistical filter ME PM2 preparser TRUMPET fragment combiner semantic interpreter discourse processing template generator Core lexicons and grammars Figure I SHOGUN configuration in MUC 5 Because many of the MUC 5 systems now perform much the same type of pre processing_comma_ name recognition_comma_ and post. processing that SIIOGUN has_comma_ we will concentrate here on linguistic analysis_comma_ includin g 110 parsing and lexical disambiguation_comma_ which were the main research areas of our work on SIIOGUN .
M93-1011.txt,24,About half of the MUC 5 systems still use linguistic analysis driven by traditional phrase structur e rules_comma_ traditional in the sense that there is a clearly separable syntactic component whose knowledge consists mainly of rules for recognizing grammatical constituents based on word categories like noun_comma_ verb and wor d order.
M93-1011.txt,25,SHOGUN differs from all these systems in that it no longer has any purely syntactic component_comma_ an d uses finite state rules in place of phrase structure rules .
M93-1011.txt,26,The remaining systems divide roughly into those that emphasize pattern matching and those that emphasize fragment parsing.
M93-1011.txt,27,The fragment parsing systems_comma_ notably BBN s_comma_ work fairly close to the way our MU 1 4 system did_comma_ taking advantage of partial parses by using a combination of syntactic and domain knowledg e to guide the combination of syntactic chunks . The difference between this approach and SHOGUN s curren t processing is that fragment parsing is still a largely syntax first method_comma_ while pattern matching tends t o introduce specialized domain and corpus knowledge by combining this knowledge with syntactic knowledg e in the system s declarative representation . By this coarse characterization_comma_ the pattern matching group of systems includes_comma_ for example_comma_ SRI an d Unisys as well as GE CMU . We also consider UMass to be in this category_comma_ because their linguistic analysi s emphasizes lexical and conceptual knowledge rather than constituent structure . Among these approaches_comma_ we believe the main differentiator is not in the basic processing algorithms but_comma_ in the way that knowledge ends up getting assigned to various system components . If there is one noteworth y trend among the MUC systems as they have evolved over time_comma_ it is that they have become more knowledge based_comma_ especially emphasizing more corpus based and lexical knowledge as well as automated knowledge acquisition methods. Within the emerging generic model_comma_ the main difference among systems is thus i n the content of their knowledge bases . Here_comma_ the distinguishing characteristic of SHOGUN is probably the degree to which the system still includes sentence level knowledge_comma_ assigning linguistic and conceptual role s much the way the TRUMP TRUMPET combination did but using more detailed_comma_ lexically driven knowledge . Many of the sentence level rules_comma_ for example_comma_ include groupings like start a facility and organization nou n phrase_comma_ which combine traditional syntactic phrases with lexical or domain knowledge . As systems continue to become still broader in scope and more accurate_comma_ it is likely that the way knowledg e is acquired will become the main differentiator . The rest of this paper will discuss the overall results of SHOGUN on MUC 5 and describe how the syste m handles some of the system walkthrough examples . The analysis of the examples will highlight some of thes e characteristics and demonstrate the system s actions in various stages of processing . OVERALL RESULTS The SHOGUN system did very well on MUC 5 . The team s specific goals were to achieve results on the MUC 5 TIPSTER tasks that were above the level of the simpler MUC 4 task_comma_ to attain comparable performance across languages and domains_comma_ and to reduce customization time as much as possible . In addition_comma_ the ai m was to produce near human accuracy at a throughput orders of magnitude faster than human beings . These goals seemed rather ambitious_comma_ but SHOGUN reached all of them . The following is a summary of SHOGUN s performance on all the official metrics . We put error rat e first and F measure last in this table because these are the only ones that can be used for overall syste m comparison the goal being low error rate and high F measure .

M93-1011.txt,30,While 11 1 it is very difficult to compare results across domains across languages_comma_ it is clear that this shows substantia l progress_comma_ as the MUC 5 tasks are certainly much harder and more detailed than MUC 4 .
M93-1011.txt,31,In addition_comma_ the average improvement between the TIPSTER 18 month benchmark and the current point was over 20 _comma_ an d there is certainly more room for further improvement .
M93-1011.txt,32,Thus we are confident that our current methods an d algorithms support continued progress toward high accuracy .
M93-1011.txt,33,While it seems that there is substantial variation among the scores on the different language domain pairs _comma_ this variation is reasonable given the differences among the task and the variations on the test samples .
M93-1011.txt,34,The EME result is worse than the others_comma_ but the EME MUC 5 test set seemed to be a very difficult one for ou r system .
M93-1011.txt,35,In fact_comma_ the system on a blind test using the same configuration scored 9 error rate points better i n EME than on the test reported above .
M93-1011.txt,36,We are not sure what accounts for this variability in EME_comma_ which is much greater than on the other domain language pairs .
M93-1011.txt,37,With respect to achieving human performance_comma_ it is not clear where good human perform falls on these scales_comma_ but we are close.
M93-1011.txt,38,At the TIPSTER 12 month test_comma_ a study of trained human analysts placed individua l analysts between 70 and 80 in F measure.
M93-1011.txt,39,However_comma_ this test used a somewhat more generous scorin g algorithm than the current one there have been a number of important changes to the scoring since th e 12 month point _comma_ and did not separate the analysts work from the preparation of the ideal answers it i s important in a blind test that the human subject have no impact on the answer key_comma_ because there are man y texts that involve fine grained interpretation .
M93-1011.txt,40,The results on Japanese are_comma_ on average_comma_ somewhat higher than the English results .
M93-1011.txt,41,This is consistent with our tests.
M93-1011.txt,42,We attribute this to the fact that the Japanese tests are considerably easier than the English a factor that is somewhat difficult to weight_comma_ given that none of our system developers know Japanese .
M93-1011.txt,43,Some of the influences that make the Japanese easier are greater homogeneity in the text sources for example _comma_ In ME includes very different sources from EJV_comma_ while JJV and JME are quite consistent in style _comma_ shorte r stories with fewer distinct events in Japanese_comma_ far fewer new joint venture companies in Japanese_comma_ and a n emphasis in Japanese on research and sales rather than production production activities are more difficul t to assign to codes in the template design .
M93-1011.txt,44,In addition to the SHOGUN system_comma_ the GE CMU team ran the Japanese benchmarks only using a syste m called TEXTRACT_comma_ which was developed in parallel to SHOGUN by Tsuyoshi Kitani_comma_ a visiting researche r at CMU from NTT Data .
M93-1011.txt,45,TEXTRACT_comma_ like SHOGUN_comma_ emphasizes lexically driven pattern matching _comma_ and the two systems share a Japanese tagging segmentation program from NTT Data_comma_ called MAJESTY .
M93-1011.txt,46,While there is little else that is directly shared between the two system s_comma_ additions to TEXTRACT s knowledge base were incrementally adapted_comma_ in functionality_comma_ to SHOGUN s knowledge base in JJV_comma_ thus it it_comma_ not surprising that the systems had similar performance on this set .
M93-1011.txt,47,TEXTRACT generally had a better performance on company name recognition than SHOGUN_comma_ and a somewhat more effective metho d of splitting events .
M93-1011.txt,48,SHOGUN had better coverage of industry types and products based_comma_ we think_comma_ on the heavy use of statistically based training _comma_ and had higher recall but lower precision in JME .
M93-1011.txt,49,Figure 3 shows the results of both systems on the recall precision scale on the various MUC 5 sets .
M93-1011.txt,50,ANALYSIS OF WALKTHROUGH MESSAGE S Overview of Example s The examples are in many ways typical of the TIPSTER SHOGUN system.
M93-1011.txt,51,These are relatively easy messages_comma_ but the problems the system encountered are illustrative.
M93-1011.txt,52,In the English message_comma_ the system made a few minor mistakes_comma_ some of which may even have been matters of fine grained interpretation_comma_ and had an error rate of 15 for EJV0592 .
M93-1011.txt,53,This is much better than the average message on the whole_comma_ the EJV performance is pulled down by tangled tie up messages in which the system has a great deal of difficulty determining who is doing what with whom . .IJ V0002 was much harder_comma_ because it requires information to be split across two tie ups .
M93-1011.txt,54,The system correctly determined that there were two tie ups which it did not do when it ran this message at the 12 nronth point _comma_ but_comma_ it failed to recognize Toukyou kaijou as an alias for Toukyou kaijou kasai hoken _comma_ and as a result ended up getting a whole bunch of aliases and entity pointers wrong .
M93-1011.txt,55,In addition_comma_ SHOGUN mad e the very typical mistake of almost getting the product service information but losing most of the points _comma_ anyway.
M93-1011.txt,56,In this case_comma_ the Japanese text says that the tie up will be selling a new product called hyu man .
M93-1011.txt,57,112 70 60 JJV JME nJJV n JME n GE CMU 50 n n SHOGUN EME EJV L GE CMU optional Textract 40 30 Precision 20 .

M93-1011.txt,59,The analyst infers from the context that hyu man is an insurance product_comma_ so the actual industry type i s finance rather than sales .
M93-1011.txt,60,Finally_comma_ the answer key contains an error in the string fill_comma_ so SHOGUN gets scored completely wrong on this object .
M93-1011.txt,61,We emphasize these minor mistakes because it helps to show_comma_ for one thing_comma_ how hard it is to get extremely high accuracy_comma_ and_comma_ for another_comma_ the relative effects of easy and hard objects .
M93-1011.txt,62,SHOGUN was_comma_ by far_comma_ the most accurate system in determining industry information_comma_ probably because our efforts on automated knowledg e acquisition used this object as a test case for both English and Japanese .
M93-1011.txt,63,However_comma_ the net effect of th e industry object in SHOGUN was a reduction in error of .2 in English and 1 .2 in Japanese over what th e system would have produced by leaving the product service slot blank .
M93-1011.txt,64,This is because potentially spuriou s information on hard objects and slots dilutes the good scores produced on the easier objects and slots .
M93-1011.txt,65,Hence it is very difficult to show improvement by getting more information the easiest improvements are to ge t higher and higher performance on the critical slots and objects .
M93-1011.txt,66,In addition_comma_ the system made many technical errors with the location and alias slots_comma_ some of which ar e illustrated here .
M93-1011.txt,67,Often these were due to bugs_comma_ but there are many other problems .
M93-1011.txt,68,The location slot s proved much more difficult than expected_comma_ because many forms of subtle inferences often affect locatio n information_comma_ such as inferring that one site subsumes another or inferring location by process of eliminatio n especially in Japanese .
M93-1011.txt,69,We will now show_comma_ very briefly_comma_ the results of each stage in processing of SHOGUN on the EJV and JJ V examples.
M93-1011.txt,70,Pre processing Pre processing identifies names_comma_ dates_comma_ locations_comma_ and other special phrases_comma_ and handles certain morphologi cal rules in Japanese.
M93-1011.txt,71,For example_comma_ the following gives some of the results of pre processing on one sentence from each example EJV0592 Sentence 0 CNAME 1 BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO .

M93-1011.txt,73,In JJV0002_comma_ Daiwashouken C IIIA is a known name_comma_ so it is not marked above.
M93-1011.txt,74,Linguistic analysi s Linguistic analysis uses the same pattern matcher and same knowledge base notation as pre processing_comma_ bu t relies on a mixture of syntactic and lexical information to perform sentence level interpretation .
M93-1011.txt,75,For example_comma_ the following is one rule for marking verb phrases with activity information in English 44  JV ACTIVITY VP  ACTIVITY  START TIME date   jventure ENTITY and org name not partner venture  VENTURE venture  member apostrophe s apostrophe rights   and venture org np not ventureterm  loc it facilityphr  np postmod which helperphr verb premod to  ACTIVITY TEXT  TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb comma TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb   comma and TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb ps text list  ACTIVITY TEXT TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb ps text list ACTIVITY TEXT comma TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb ps text list  comma and ACTIVITY TEXT TIE UP ACTIVITY actverb ps text list   not date  loc  not date  START TIME date loc   mark jv activator c joint venture template In linguistic analysis_comma_ the pattern matcher annotates the text_comma_ much like it does during pre processing _comma_ but these annotations can be very close to the roles that portions of text will play in the template .
M93-1011.txt,76,For example_comma_ where pre processing finds company names and organization descriptions_comma_ sentence analysis wil l often find partners and ventures.

M93-1015.txt,2,It was produced as part of our efforts in the Tipster project.
M93-1015.txt,3,The same overall system architecture has been used for English and Japanese and for the micro electronics and join t venture domains.
M93-1015.txt,4,The past history of the system is discussed and the operation of its major components described .
M93-1015.txt,5,A summary of scores at the 24 month workshop is given and the performance of the system o n the texts selected for the system walkthrough is discussed . .
M93-1015.txt,6,The Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University_comma_ in collaboration with Brandeis University_comma_ was one of four sites selected to develop systems to extract relevant information automatically from English and Japanese texts .
M93-1015.txt,7,The systems produced by the Tipster research groups hav e already been evaluated at 12 and 18 months into the project .
M93-1015.txt,8,The performance of the Diderot System has improved both for English and Japanese .

M93-1015.txt,12,The results of this analysis have been use d to develop and test the systems produced by each site.
M93-1015.txt,13,The software used to support this huma n extraction task_comma_ both for English and Japanese_comma_ was developed and supported by the CRL under a separate subcontract .
M93-1015.txt,14,Because of the emphasis on different languages and different subject areas the research has focused on the development of general purpose_comma_ re usable techniques.
M93-1015.txt,15,The CRL Brandeis group have implemented statistical methods for focusing on the relevant parts of texts_comma_ programs which recognize an d mark names of people_comma_ places and organizations and also dates .
M93-1015.txt,16,The actual analysis of the critical parts of the texts is carried out by a parser controlled by lexical structures for the key words in the text .
M93-1015.txt,17,To extend the system s coverage of English and Japanese some of the content of these lexical structure s was derived from machine readable dictionaries .
M93-1015.txt,18,These were then enhanced with information extracted from corpora.
M93-1015.txt,19,161 The system has already been evaluated in the 4th Message Understanding Conference MUC 4 where it was required to extract information from 200 texts on South American terrorism .
M93-1015.txt,20,Considering the very short development time allowed for this additional domain the system performed adequately.
M93-1015.txt,21,The system was then adapted to handle the business domain and also to process Japanese texts .
M93-1015.txt,22,Further extensions to the system allowed it to process texts on micro electronics development .
M93-1015.txt,23,Performance at the 12 and 18 month evaluations was good for Japanese_comma_ but less good for English wher e we have been attempting to automate much of the development process .
M93-1015.txt,24,A more pragmatic approach was adopted for the final 24 month evaluation_comma_ using the same hand crafted techniques for English a s had been used for Japanese .
M93-1015.txt,25,We estimate the amount of effort used directly to build the systems described here is around sixt y man months .
M93-1015.txt,26,MAIN RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Our objectives in this research have been as follows  to develop and implement a language independent framework for lexical semantic representation _comma_ and develop and implement a robust integration of that framework into a language independent theory of semantic processing to investigate and implement language independent techniques for automating the building o f lexical knowledge bases from machine readable resources  to implement statistical tools for the tuning of lexical structures to specific domains  to implement the use of language independent statistical techniques for identifying relevan t passages of documents for more detailed analysis  to develop and implement a set of robust multi pass finite state feature taggers  to develop and implement the equivalent methods for Japanese .
M93-1015.txt,27,SYSTEM OVERVIE W An outline of the functions of the main system modules are given here .
M93-1015.txt,28,This is intended to provide a context for the more detailed description of each module which follows .
M93-1015.txt,29,The structures of the Japanese and English systems are very similar .
M93-1015.txt,30,In the examples of intermediate output either Japanese or Englis h may be shown.
M93-1015.txt,31,The system architecture is shown in figure 1 .
M93-1015.txt,32,The input text to the system is processed by three independent pre processing modules  A chain of finite state feature taggers these mark names_comma_ organization names_comma_ place names _comma_ date expressions and other proper names depending on the domain _comma_ A part of speech tagger _comma_ A statistically based determiner of text relevance micro only .
M93-1015.txt,33,If the statistical determination rejects the text processing proceeds to the final output stage an d an empty template is produced .
M93-1015.txt,34,Otherwise the results of the other two stages are converted to Prolo g facts and these then pass into the head of a chain of processes each of which gives rise to furthe r refinements of the text  Merge Here semantic tags_comma_ which may mark phrasal units_comma_ are merged with POS tags_comma_ which mark individual words . Compound noun recognizer this groups words and phrases into compound nouns using PO S and semantic information.
M93-1015.txt,35,162 PartofRelevance Statistics erSpeechTa Transformer Reference Resolver Figure 1 System Overview Parser the relevant paragraph information is used to select which sentences to process further.
M93-1015.txt,36,The sentences containing the marked up noun phrase groups are then parsed to produce a partially completed representation of the relevant semantic content of the sentence frames . Reference resolver the frames are then merged based on name matching and noun compound s beginning with definite articles . Template formatter this transforms the resolved frames into the final output form .
M93-1015.txt,37,Statistical Filtering Technique s Statistical information is used to predict whether a text holds important information that is relevan t to completing a template .
M93-1015.txt,38,This allows the parser to skip non relevant texts .
M93-1015.txt,39,This is based on word list s which are derived from training on relevant and irrelevant texts .
M93-1015.txt,40,The theoretical results on which the method 6 is based assure us that documents can be classified correctly if appropriate sets of word s can be chosen for each document type .
M93-1015.txt,41,The method was only applied to the micro domain for MUC 5 as almost all texts in the joint venture domain are relevant and the use of this statistical method i s essentially a way of improving precision in text filtering.
M93-1015.txt,42,The results for the micro electronics domain for text filtering are 84 recall and 90 precision 7 3 and 83 at 18 month for Japanese_comma_ and 78 recall and 83 precision 77 and 76 at 18 month fo r 163 English .

M92-1006.txt,1,paper reports on the results of the adjunct test performed by GE for the MUC 4 evaluation of text processing systems . In this test_comma_ we evaluated the effect of an object oriented templat e design and associated matching conditions on the scores .
M92-1006.txt,2,The results indicate that the current MUC . flat templade design with cross references closely approximates a true object oriente d design.
M92-1006.txt,3,However the object oriented design allows for additional performance data to be calculated _comma_ facilitating diagnosis . .
M92-1006.txt,4,In this adjunct test_comma_ we investigate the issues and effect of transforming the MUC 4 template design automatically into an object oriented design_comma_ with associated object level matching conditions affecting th e overall score .
